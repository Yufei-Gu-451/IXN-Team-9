The inflammatory microenvironment contributes to cancer development and progression. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), as important stromal cells, may be 'educated' by the inflammatory microenvironment to support the development of gastric cancer. Cytokines are a key component of cancer-related inflammation. Interleukin (IL)-6, as an inflammatory cytokine, has multiple roles in cancer. However, whether MSCs can be 'educated' by IL-6 to support gastric cancer remains unknown. In the present study, we focused on the phenotype and function of human umbilical cord-derived MSCs hUC-MSCs pre-treated with IL-6 in gastric cancer. We found that the protein levels of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) were upregulated, and phosphorylated nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB protein levels were downregulated in the hUC-MSCs pretreated with IL-6, as shown by western blot analysis. The levels of tumor-promoting cytokines, including chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5 (CCL5), platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and tumor necrosis factor alpha(TNFalpha), were markedly reduced in the hUC-MSCs following treatment with IL-6, as shown by RT-qPCR.
