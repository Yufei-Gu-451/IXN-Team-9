To study the association of depressive symptoms or antidepressant medicine (ADM) use with subsequent cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor status in the Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) trial of weight loss in type 2 diabetes. Participants (Prior year elevated BDI was associated with subsequent CVD risk factor-positive status for the DSE arm (A1C [odds ratio 1.30 (95% CI 1.09-1.56)]; total cholesterol [0.80 (0.65-1.00)]; i.e., protective from high total cholesterol) and the ILI arm (HDL [1.40 (1.12-1.75)], triglyceride [1.28 (1.00-1.64)]). Prior year ADM use predicted subsequent elevated CVD risk status for the DSE arm (HDL [1.24 (1.03-1.50)], total cholesterol [1.28 (1.05-1.57)], current smoking [1.73 (1.04-2.88)]) and for the ILI arm (A1C [1.25 (1.08-1.46)], HDL [1.32 (1.11-1.58)], triglycerides [1.75 (1.43-2.14)], systolic blood pressure [1.39 (1.11-1.74)], and obesity [1.46 (1.22-2.18)]). Aggressive monitoring of CVD risk in diabetic patients with depressive symptoms or who are treated with ADM may be warranted.
