We use the extension block Kirschner wire method that orginated from Ishigura to treat mallet fracture and evaluate its efficiency. 38 patients were treated prospectively. Mean follow-up was 18 months and all patients evaluated radiologically and clinically according to Crawford's criteria. Union was obtained in all patients. The results obtained were satisfactory in 34 cases, unsatisfactory 4 cases. We think that extension block technique is a safe and effective method that can be used in all mallet fractures.
