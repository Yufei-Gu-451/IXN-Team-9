Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is related to the pathogenesis of several diseases. Sclerostin is an inhibitor of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. However, there are few data regarding the sclerostin levels and vascular disease. Our aim was to examine the relationship between serum sclerostin and atherosclerotic disease (AD) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We performed a cross-sectional study including 78 T2DM patients (45.3% females, mean age 59 +/- 5.7 years; 54.7% males, 57.4 +/- 6.7 years). Serum sclerostin concentrations of T2DM patients in the AD group were significantly higher than in the non-AD group (Circulating sclerostin is increased in T2DM patients with atherosclerotic lesions. Although the sample size of our study was small, these data suggest that sclerostin levels could be a major modulator of Wnt signaling in AD with implications in T2DM patients.
