CYFRA 21-1 serves as biomarker in several epithelial malignancies. However, its role in pancreatic cancer (PC) has not yet been investigated. Within a prospective single-centre study serial blood samples were collected from patients with confirmed advanced PC. Pre-treatment values and weekly measurements of CYFRA 21-1, carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) and carcinoembryonic antigen (assessed by Elecsys 2010, Roche Diagnostics) during palliative first-line chemotherapy were obtained. Biomarker data were correlated with objective response (determined by RECIST) as well as time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS) using uni- and multivariate analyses. Seventy-eight patients were included, 45% of these received treatment in prospective clinical trials. Median TTP was 3.9 months, median OS 7.7 months. Pre-treatment CYFRA 21-1 levels were significantly associated with performance status (CYFRA 21-1 may serve as a valuable tool for monitoring treatment response and assessing prognosis in advanced PC.
