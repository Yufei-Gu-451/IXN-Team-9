The kinesin-5 motor Eg5 has a novel non-mitotic role in the transport of a specific class of transport carriers (CARTS) from the trans-Golgi network to the cell surface. Here we report that the kinesin-5 motor Klp61F, which is known for its role in bipolar spindle formation in mitosis, is required for protein transport from the Golgi complex to the cell surface in
