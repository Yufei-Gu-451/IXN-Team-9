Demonstrate the presence and magnitude of biomechanical variables during gait in patients with medial knee osteoarthritis (OA) and the relationship with the knee loading. Gait of 21 subjects diagnosed with medial knee OA was evaluated and compared to the control group. The group with OA showed: Lower gait speed (0.8 +/- 0.1 vs. 1.1 +/- 0.1m/s), higher peak early (2.6 +/- 1.2 vs. 0.3 +/- 1.4 Nm/Kg) and late peak of the adduction moment (1.8 +/- 0.7 vs. 0.9 +/- 0.2 Nm/Kg), higher peak flexor moment (1.6 +/- 0.9 vs. 0.6 +/- 0.4 Nm/Kg), high dynamic peak varus (11.5o +/- 8.3 vs. 3o +/- 3.9), higher peak flexion (15.6o +/- 8 vs. 9.3o to +/- 4.1), with a flexion tendency (5.5o +/- 8.5) in the stance phase, smaller peak of flexion (58.7o +/- 13.3 vs. 67.5o +/- 4.8) in the balance phase and higher peaks of external rotation (25.5o +/- 12.7 vs. 0.5o +/- 22.4). Patients with medial knee OA show changes in gait with increased external rotation, speed reduction, increased flexor moment and flexion in the stance phase, insufficient for reduction of the load.
