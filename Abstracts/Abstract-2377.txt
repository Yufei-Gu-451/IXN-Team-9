Obesity and type 2 diabetes continue to increase in prevalence in the U.S. Whether diabetes incidence continues to increase in recent times is less well documented. We examined trends in diabetes incidence over the previous four decades. Framingham Heart Study participants ages 40-55 years and free of diabetes at baseline (The annualized rates of diabetes per 1,000 individuals were 2.6, 3.8, 4.7, and 3.0 (women) and 3.4, 4.5, 7.4, and 7.3 (men) in the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, respectively. Compared with the 1970s, the age- and sex-adjusted relative risks of diabetes were 1.37 (95% CI 0.87-2.16;In our community-based sample, the risk of new-onset diabetes continued to be higher in the 2000s compared with the 1970s. In the past decade, diabetes incidence remained steady despite the ongoing trend of rising adiposity.
