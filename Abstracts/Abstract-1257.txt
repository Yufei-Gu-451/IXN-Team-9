Interpreting mitochondrial function as affected by comparative physiologic conditions is confounding because individual functional parameters are interdependent. Here, we studied muscle mitochondrial function in insulin-deficient diabetes using a novel, highly sensitive, and specific method to quantify ATP production simultaneously with reactive oxygen species (ROS) at clamped levels of inner mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi), enabling more detailed study. We used a 2-deoxyglucose (2DOG) energy clamp to set DeltaPsi at fixed levels and to quantify ATP production as 2DOG conversion to 2DOG-phosphate measured by one-dimensional
