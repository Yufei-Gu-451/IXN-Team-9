Nucleotide excision repair (NER) removes UV-induced DNA damage and other bulky DNA lesions thereby maintaining genomic integrity. Dr. Qingyi Wei's group demonstrated over the last decade that NER fidelity and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in NER genes constitute melanoma risk biomarkers. In this issue (Li
