The maxillary posterior area is the most challenging site for the dental implant. Although the sinus graft is a predictable and successful technique for rehabilitation of atrophic and pneumatized posterior maxilla, when there is severe destruction of alveolar bone, a very long crown length remains challenging after successful dental implants installation with sinus graft. We performed vertical augmentation of the maxillary posterior alveolar ridge using the allogenic block bone graft with a simultaneous sinus graft using allogenic and heterogenic bone chips. After about six months, we installed the dental implant. After this procedure, we achieved a more favorable crown-implant fixture ratio and better results clinically and biomechanically. This is a preliminary report of vertical augmentation of maxillary posterior alveolar ridge using allogenic block bone graft and simultaneous maxillary sinus graft. Further research requires longer observation and more patients.
