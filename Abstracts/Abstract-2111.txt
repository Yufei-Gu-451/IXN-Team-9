The introduction of new crops with improved salinity stress tolerance could preserve water quality and protect soil resources from further degradation, providing extra sources of food for salinized areas. In this context, we tested the salinity tolerance of a variety of quinoa. Quinoa, a rich source of minerals, proteins and antioxidants, is considered a major alternative crop to meet food shortages in this century. Our study indicated that salinity tolerance of quinoa is largely conferred by a delicate balance between osmotic adjustment and ion accumulation. Salinity reduced productivity in terms of biomass, but increased the levels of antioxidant compounds, which are important health-protecting factors in food, thus providing economic benefit. Salinization is increasing on a global scale, decreasing average yields for most major crop plants. Investigations into salt resistance have, unfortunately, mainly been focused on conventional crops, with few studies screening the potential of available halophytes as new crops. This study has been carried out to investigate the mechanisms used by quinoa, a facultative halophytic species, in order to cope with high salt levels at various stages of its development. Quinoa is regarded as one of the crops that might sustain food security in this century, grown primarily for its edible seeds with their high protein content and unique amino acid composition. Although the species has been described as a facultative halophyte, and its tolerance to salt stress has been investigated, its physiological and molecular responses to seawater (SW) and other salts have not been studied. We evaluated the effects of SW and different salts on seed germination, seedling emergence and the antioxidative pathway of quinoa. Seeds were germinated in Petri dishes and seedlings grown in pots with SW solutions (25, 50, 75 and 100 %) and NaCl, CaCl
