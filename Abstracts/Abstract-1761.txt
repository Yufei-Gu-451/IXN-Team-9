To examine the acute and 24-h glycemic responses to reductions in postexercise rapid-acting insulin dose in type 1 diabetic patients. After preliminary testing, 11 male patients (24 +/- 2 years, HbAAll glycemic responses were similar across conditions up to 60 min postexercise. After the postexercise meal, blood glucose was preserved under 50%, but declined under Full and 75%. Thence at 3 h, blood glucose was highest under 50% (50% [10.4 +/- 1.2] vs. Full [6.2 +/- 0.7] and 75% [7.6 +/- 1.2 mmol ? LA 25% pre-exercise and 50% postexercise rapid-acting insulin dose preserves glycemia and protects patients against early-onset hypoglycemia ( less than =8 h). However, this strategy does not protect against late-onset postexercise hypoglycemia.
