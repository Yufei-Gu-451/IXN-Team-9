To examine the loss of glucagon response to hypoglycemia and its relationship with residual beta-cell function early in the course of type 1 diabetes (T1D) in youth. Twenty-one youth with T1D duration less than 1 year (ages 8-18 years, T1D duration 6-52 weeks) underwent mixed-meal tolerance tests (MMTTs) to assess residual beta-cell function and hypoglycemic clamps to assess glucagon responses to hypoglycemia. Glucagon responses to hypoglycemia in T1D subjects were compared with those in 12 nondiabetic young adults (ages 19-25 years). Peak MMTT-stimulated C-peptide levels (range 0.12-1.43) were greater than =0.2 nmol/L in all but one T1D subject. As expected, the median of glucagon responses to hypoglycemia in the T1D subjects (18 pg/mL [interquartile range 7-32]) was significantly reduced compared with the responses in nondiabetic control subjects (38 pg/mL [19-66],Impaired plasma glucagon responses to hypoglycemia are evident in youth with T1D during the first year of the disease. Moreover, defective and absent glucagon responses to hypoglycemia were observed in patients who retained clinically important residual endogenous beta-cell function.
