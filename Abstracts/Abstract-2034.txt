Radical three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (CFRT) with initial androgen suppression (AS) is a standard management for localised prostate cancer (PC). This pilot study evaluated the role of dose escalation and appropriate target volume margin. Here, we report long-term follow-up. Eligible patients had T1b-T3b N0 M0 PC. After neoadjuvant AS, they were randomised to CFRT, giving (a) 64 Gy with either a 1.0- or 1.5-cm margin and (b) +/-10 Gy boost to the prostate alone. One hundred and twenty-six men were randomised and treated. Median follow-up was 13.7 years. The median age was 66.6 years at randomisation. Median presenting prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was 14 ng mlLong-term follow-up of this small pilot study is compatible with a benefit from dose escalation, but confirmation from larger trials is required. There was no obvious detriment using the smaller radiotherapy margin.
