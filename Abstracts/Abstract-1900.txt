Locomotion of cancer cells can be induced by TNF and other motogenic factors secreted by cells of the tumour microenvironment such as macrophages. Based on our recent findings that the TNF receptor adaptor protein FAN mediates TNF-induced actin reorganisation and regulates the directed migration of immune cells responding to chemotactic cues, we addressed the role of FAN in cancer cell motility and the formation of invadopodia, a crucial feature in tumour invasion. In B16 mouse melanoma cells, FAN was downregulated and the impact on FAN on cell motility and invasion was determined usingLike FANThe results of our study suggest that FAN through promoting melanoma cellular motility and tumour invasiveness is critical for the tumour-promoting action of TNF.
