To scientifically prove the high number of patients with fractures coming from the small towns of the State of Ceara treated with surgery by the SUS (the Brazilian State healthcare system) in Fortaleza. A transversal, prospective, descriptive study was carried out involving 1694 patients treated by the SUS in Fortaleza, from August 2006 to March 2007, in four public hospitals and three private hospitals. 38.78% of the patients came from small towns, and their ages ranged from 1 to 97 years old. The majority were single, male adults. The most common mechanism of injury was traffic accidents, accounting for 30.4% of all the cases. The forearm was the body segment most operated on, corresponding to 19%. These results suggest there is a need for preventive measures, such as public traffic safety awareness campaigns, in order to reduce accidents. We have also verified the importance of investments aimed at developing the Traumatology Emergency services in the small towns of Ceara.
