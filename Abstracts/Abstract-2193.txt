This study examined patients with facial bone fracture visiting Pusan National University Dental Hospital to understand the trends, and to enhance appropriate care and treatment for patients with facial bone fracture. We investigated 531 patients presenting with facial bone fracture in Yangsan and 802 patients in Busan from January 2010 to December 2013. We divided the patients by year, month, gender, age, site, and cause to compare with historic data and other studies. The gender ratio was 3.58:1 in Yangsan and 4.31:1 in Busan. Patients aged in their 20s had the highest number of facial bone fractures in both Yangsan and Busan. The most frequent fracture site was the mandible, and the most frequent cause was slip down in both Yangsan and Busan. The investigation and comparison of patients with facial bone fracture who visited Pusan National University Hospital located at Yangsan and Busan from 2010 to 2013 found a difference in the total number of patients at each hospital, but the trends were not significantly different.
