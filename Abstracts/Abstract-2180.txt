The current gold standard for clinical jawbone formation involves autogenous bone as a graft material. In addition, demineralized dentin can be an effective graft material. Although demineralized dentin readily induces heterotopic bone formation, conventional decalcification takes three to five days, so, immediate bone grafting after extraction is impossible. This study evaluated the effect of vacuum ultrasonic power on the demineralization and processing of autogenous tooth material and documented the clinical results of rapidly processed autogenous demineralized dentin (ADD) in an alveolar defects patient. The method involves the demineralization of extracted teeth with detached soft tissues and pulp in 0.6 N HCl for 90 minutes using a heat controlled vacuum-ultrasonic accelerator. The characteristics of processed teeth were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Bone grafting using ADD was performed for narrow ridges augmentation in the mandibular area. The new processing method was completed within two hours regardless of form (powder or block). EDS and SEM uniformly demineralized autotooth biomaterial. After six months, bone remodeling was observed in augmented sites and histological examination showed that ADD particles were well united with new bone. No unusual complications were encountered. This study demonstrates the possibility of preparing autogenous tooth graft materials within two hours, allowing immediate one-day grafting after extraction.
