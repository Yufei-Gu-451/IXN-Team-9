Targeted cancer therapies, while often effective, have limited utility due to preexisting primary or acquired secondary resistance. Consequently, agents are sometimes used in combination to simultaneously affect multiple targets. MicroRNA mimics are excellent therapeutic candidates because of their ability to repress multiple oncogenic pathways at once. Here we treated the aggressive
