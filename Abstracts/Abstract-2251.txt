Abnormal glucose tolerance is rising in sub-Saharan Africa. Hemoglobin AAn oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed in 216 African immigrants (68% male, age 37 +/- 10 years [mean +/- SD], range 20-64 years). Abnormal glucose tolerance was defined as 2-h glucose greater than =7.8 mmol/L. Variant hemoglobin was identified in 21% (46 of 216). Abnormal glucose tolerance occurred in 33% (72 of 216). When determining abnormal glucose tolerance from the OGTT (2-h glucose greater than =7.8 mmol/L), sensitivities of FPG for the total, normal, and variant hemoglobin groups were 32%, 32%, and 33%, respectively. Sensitivities for A1C were 53%, 54%, and 47%. For FPG and A1C combined, sensitivities were 64%, 63%, and 67%. Sensitivities for FPG and A1C and the combination did not vary by hemoglobin status (allNo significant difference in sensitivity of A1C by variant hemoglobin status was detected. For the diagnosis of abnormal glucose tolerance in Africans, the sensitivity of A1C combined with FPG is significantly superior to either test alone.
