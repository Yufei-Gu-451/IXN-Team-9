We investigated whether glycation gap (G-Gap), an index of intracellular glycation of proteins, was associated with diabetes complications. We measured concomitantly HbAMacroproteinuria was the only complication that was associated with G-Gap (prevalence in the first, second, and third tertile of G-Gap: 2.9, 6.2, and 11.0%, respectively;In type 2 diabetic patients, G-Gap was associated with macroproteinuria, independently of HbA
