Disruption of Apc within hepatocytes activates Wnt signaling, perturb differentiation and ultimately lead to neoplasia. Apc negatively regulates Wnt signaling but is also involved in organizing the cytoskeleton and may play a role in chromosome segregation. To address the role of p53 in these processes, we analyzed combined loss of Apc and p53, which led to a further increase in proliferation, cell death, DNA damages and repair and a bypass of G2 arrest than was observed with Apc loss. However we observed only a marginal effect on anaphase bridges and centrosome number which could be due to increased cell death. Our data therefore establishes, in an
