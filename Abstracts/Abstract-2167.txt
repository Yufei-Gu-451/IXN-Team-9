The purpose of this study was to 1) determine the prevalence of weight misperception among overweight and obese men with total body fat levels greater than = 25%; and 2) examine associations of weight misperception with anthropometric and body composition measures. Data came from 4,200 overweight or obese men from the 1999-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. Weight misperception was operationalized as having a dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) derived total body fat percent (TBF) greater than = 25% and classifying oneself as either "underweight" or "about right weight." Logistic regression was used to determine physical characteristics associated with weight misperception. Weight misperception was highest among Mexican American (35.9%) followed by Black (30.8%) and White men (22.9%). Physical characteristics (OR, 95% CI) associated with weight misperception were decreased arm fat (0.95, 0.91-0.98), being overweight (9.02, 5.34-15.24), and having a waist circumference less than = 94 cm (2.31, 1.72-3.09). Findings suggest that future research should include a measure of adiposity in the operationalization of weight misperception among male populations.
