Malignant pheochromocytomas respond to chemotherapy with a reduction in tumor size and catecholamine secretion. We investigated the usefulness of molecular imaging with meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) for evaluating the effects of chemotherapy in patients with malignant pheochromocytoma. Six patients were studied before and after 6 +/- 4 months of combination chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and dacarbazine. Urinary catecholamines, metanephrines, and vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) levels were measured before and after chemotherapy. [
