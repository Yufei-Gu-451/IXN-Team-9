Newly developed scientific complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (sCMOS) cameras have the potential to dramatically accelerate data acquisition in single-molecule switching nanoscopy (SMSN) while simultaneously increasing the effective quantum efficiency. However, sCMOS-intrinsic pixel-dependent readout noise substantially reduces the localization precision and introduces localization artifacts. Here we present algorithms that overcome these limitations and provide unbiased, precise localization of single molecules at the theoretical limit. In combination with a multi-emitter fitting algorithm, we demonstrate single-molecule localization super-resolution imaging at up to 32 reconstructed images/second (recorded at 1,600-3,200 camera frames/second) in both fixed and living cells.
