Susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) is a technique that exploits the susceptibility difference between tissues to provide contrast for different regions of the brain. In essence, it uses the deoxygenated hemoglobin of veins, hemosiderin of hemorrhage, etc. as intrinsic contrast agents, allowing for much better visualization of blood and microvessels even without administration of an external contrast agent. It is a fast-evolving field that is being constantly improved and increasingly implemented with updates in relevant technology. Multiple studies have been done on the role of SWI in the management of various neurologic disorders and it is also being seen as a further step in the neuroradiologist's goal of being able to noninvasively grade tumors in order to influence therapy. This article briefly reviews the evolution of SWI since its conception and provides the reader with a comprehensive summary of various studies that have been done on its application for detecting and grading intraaxial brain tumors, specifically gliomas. Other useful magnetic resonance techniques that have shown promise in grading gliomas are also discussed.
