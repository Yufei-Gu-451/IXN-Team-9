Lissencephaly-1 promotes the interaction of dynein with dynactin and facilitates motor complex association with mRNA cargos. Microtubule-based transport mediates the sorting and dispersal of many cellular components and pathogens. However, the mechanisms by which motor complexes are recruited to and regulated on different cargos remain poorly understood. Here we describe a large-scale biochemical screen for novel factors associated with RNA localization signals mediating minus end-directed mRNA transport during
