We used intravenous arginine with measurements of insulin, C-peptide, and glucagon to examine beta-cell and alpha-cell survival and function in a group of 10 chronic pancreatitis recipients 1-8 years after total pancreatectomy and autoislet transplantation. Insulin and C-peptide responses correlated robustly with the number of islets transplanted (correlation coefficients range 0.81-0.91;
