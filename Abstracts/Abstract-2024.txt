Gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) - a membrane-bound enzyme crucially involved in the cell's detoxification pathway and apoptotic balance - is involved in tumour development, progression and chemotherapy resistance. Elevated GGT serum levels are associated with increased cancer risk in women and worse prognosis in gynaecologic cancers. The present study investigated the prognostic role of GGT in ovarian cancer patients. In this multicenter study, pre-therapeutic GGT levels were ascertained in 634 consecutive patients with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC,Pre-therapeutic GGT serum levels were higher in patients with EOC (28.56 (38.24) U lHigh pre-therapeutic GGT serum levels are associated with advanced tumour stage and serve as an independent prognostic marker for worse overall survival in patients with EOC. Gamma-glutamyltransferase expression in ovarian cancer tissue is reflected in GGT serum levels.
