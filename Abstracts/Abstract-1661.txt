Liver dysfunction is believed to contribute to the metabolic derangements of critical illness. The cellular basis of liver dysfunction is poorly understood and its consequences largely unknown. Recent work by Gonnert and colleagues sheds additional light. Using two imaging techniques to track the clearance of biotransformed dyes by the liver in a rat model of intra-abdominal infection, the authors show that the predominant defect in sepsis lies in the excretion of biotransformed molecules from the hepatocyte into the bile canaliculi. Their work both points to a new aspect of hepatic dysfunction through focus on a role in the metabolic derangements of sepsis and suggests a possible strategy to diagnose and monitor this process in critically ill patients.
