Macroglossia can create dental and skeletal instability after orthodontic treatment or orthognathic surgery for mandibular prognathism. In relevant literature, partial glossectomy is suggested for a good post-treatment prognosis. Most of the published partial glossectomy cases are two-staged surgery, because of concern about postoperative airway obstruction. As orthognathic surgical techniques and fixation method develop, however, concerns about postoperative airway obstruction have lessened. In this case, mandibular setback surgery and partial glossectomy were performed simultaneously, leading to stable recovery without any postoperative respiratory problems. After surgical technique to preserve the tongue tip, we achieved good outcomes without postoperative side effects of lingual hypoesthesia, pronunciation disorder and dyskinesia. We report this case with a literature review.
