Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) constitute a major effector population in pancreatic islets from patients suffering from type 1 diabetes (T1D) and thus represent attractive targets for intervention. Some studies have suggested that blocking the interaction between the chemokine CXCL10 and its receptor CXCR3 on activated CTLs potently inhibits their recruitment and prevents beta-cell death. Since recent studies on human pancreata from T1D patients have indicated that both ligand and receptor are abundantly present, we reevaluated whether their interaction constitutes a pivotal node within the chemokine network associated with T1D. Our present data in a viral mouse model challenge the notion that specific blockade of the CXCL10/CXCR3 chemokine axis halts T1D onset and progression.
