Transcriptional enhancers are a primary mechanism by which tissue-specific gene expression is achieved. Despite the importance of these regulatory elements in development, responses to environmental stresses, and disease, testing enhancer activity in animals remains tedious, with a minority of enhancers having been characterized. Here, we have developed 'enhancer-FACS-Seq' (eFS) technology for highly parallel identification of active, tissue-specific enhancers in
