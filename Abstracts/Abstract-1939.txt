Somatic hypermutation in variable heavy chain rearranged regions is abrogated in the absence of the 3' regulatory region enhancer, whereas transcription rate in the Ig heavy chain is only partially reduced. Interactions with cognate antigens recruit activated B cells into germinal centers where they undergo somatic hypermutation (SHM) in V(D)J exons for the generation of high-affinity antibodies. The contribution of IgH transcriptional enhancers in SHM is unclear. The E
