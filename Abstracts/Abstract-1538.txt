To determine the influence of dietary glycemic index on exercise training-induced adaptations in substrate oxidation in obesity. Twenty older, obese individuals undertook 3-months of fully-supervised aerobic exercise and were randomised to low (LoGIX) or high glycemic (HiGIX) diets. Changes in indirect calorimetry (VOWeight loss (-8.6+/-1.1%) and improvements (P less than 0.05) in VOA low glycemic diet/exercise weight-loss intervention increases fat utilization during exercise independent of changes in energy expenditure. This highlights the potential therapeutic value of low glycemic foods for reversing metabolic defects in obesity.
