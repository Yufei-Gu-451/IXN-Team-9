Several recent studies demonstrated that microRNAs are stably detectable in plasma/serum. We tested whether miR-18a, which is located in the miR-17-92 cluster and reported to be highly expressed in tissues of oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), served as a plasma biomarker in patients with ESCC. This study was divided into three steps: (1) confirmation of higher miR-18a levels in primary ESCC tissues and cell lines than normal ESCC tissues and a human fibroblast cell line. (2) Evaluation of the plasma miR-18a assay using quantitative RT-PCR by comparing results from 106 consecutive patients with ESCC and 54 healthy volunteers. (3) Evaluation of the assay for monitoring tumour dynamics in patients with ESCC. (1) Expression of miR-18a was significantly higher in ESCC tissues (Plasma miR-18a may be a very useful biomarker for cancer detection and the monitoring of tumour dynamics in patients with ESCC.
