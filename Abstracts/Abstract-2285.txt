Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) occur when a patient's response to the drug is modified by administration or co-exposure to another drug. The main cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme, CYP3A4, is implicated in the metabolism of almost all of the tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Therefore, there is a substantial potential for interaction between TKIs and other drugs that modulate the activity of this metabolic pathway. Cancer patients are susceptible to DDIs as they receive many medications, either for supportive care or for treatment of toxicity. Differences in DDI outcomes are generally negligible because of the wide therapeutic window of common drugs. However for anticancer agents, serious clinical consequences may occur from small changes in drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics. Therefore, the objective of this review is to highlight the current understanding of DDIs among TKIs, with a focus on metabolism, as well as to identify challenges in the prediction of DDIs and provide recommendations.
