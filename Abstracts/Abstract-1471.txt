Glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) has been suggested as a major factor for the improved glucose tolerance ensuing after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) surgery. We examined the effect of blocking endogenous GLP-1 action on glucose tolerance in subjects with sustained remission of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) present before RYGBP. Blood glucose, insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, GLP-1, and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide levels were measured after a meal challenge with either exendin-(9-39) (a GLP-1r antagonist) or saline infusion in eight subjects with sustained remission of T2DM after RYGBP and seven healthy controls. Infusion of exendin-(9-39) resulted in marginal deterioration of the 2-h plasma glucose after meal intake in RYGBP subjects [saline 78.4 +/- 15.1 mg/dL compared with exendin-(9-39) 116.5 +/- 22.3 mg/dL;The limited deterioration of glucose tolerance on blockade of GLP-1 action in our study suggests the resolution of T2DM after RYGBP may be explained by mechanisms beyond enhancement of GLP-1 action.
