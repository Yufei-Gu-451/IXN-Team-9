In the current study, we investigated whether anti-CD27 monoclonal antibody can enhance the antitumor efficacy of a dendritic cell-based vaccine in prostate cancer-bearing mice. The overall therapeutic effect of a dendritic cell-based vaccine for prostate cancer remains moderate. A prostate cancer model was established by subcutaneous injection of RM-1 tumor cells into male C57BL/6 mice on day 0. After 4 days, tumor-bearing mice were treated with RM-1 tumor lysate-pulsed dendritic cells (
