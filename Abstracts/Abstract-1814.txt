To describe, in a cadaver study, the anatomical arrangement of the proximal third medial femoral circumflex artery (MFCA). We evaluated the anatomic arrangement of the proximal third of the MFCA through dissection in 12 cadaver hips. After measuring their height in meters (M), several parameters were determined: angle of lateralization of MFCA (A), Depth MFCA in relation to the superomedial origin of the quadratus femoris muscle (P), and distance of MFCA from the superolateral insertion of the muscle quadratus femoris (D). In the comparison of mean parameters between the sexes, it was noted that: Male A = 43.6 degrees, female A = 38.3 degrees. Male D = 6mm, female D = 9.5mm. Male P = 20.8 mm, female P = 18.3mm. The average for parameters A and P were lower in females, but parameter D was higher in females. We should use, as the secure surface parameter for the proximal third of the MFCA, the superolateral insertion point of the quadratus femoris. The fact that the parameter D of MFCA is greater in females than in males. Disconnecting the quadratus femoris at its point of origin in the isquio may offer greater security to MFCA than doing it at the point of femoral insertion.
