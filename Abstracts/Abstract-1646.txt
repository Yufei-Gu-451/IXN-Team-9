Although therapeutic hypothermia could serve as a potential therapeutic strategy for treatment of traumatic hemorrhagic shock, significant controversy exists regarding its safety and feasibility. The current resuscitation strategy in traumatic hemorrhagic shock may also require updating. In this article, we have carried out an extensive literature search in this field and propose an initial algorithm for use of therapeutic hypothermia in traumatic hemorrhagic shock. This work lays essential groundwork for future investigations in this field.
