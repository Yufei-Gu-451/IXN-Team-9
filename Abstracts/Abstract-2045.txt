We conducted a multicentre feasibility study for single agent long-term S-1 chemotherapy following docetaxel plus cisplatin in patients with curatively resected stage II-IIIA non-small cell lung cancer. Patients received three cycles of docetaxel (60 mg mOne hundred and thirty-one patients were enrolled, of whom 129 patients were eligible and assessable. In all, 109 patients (84.5%) completed 3 cycles of docetaxel plus cisplatin and 66 patients (51.2%, 95% CI: 42.5-59.8) completed 8 or more cycles of S-1 treatment. Grade 3/4 toxicities during the S-1 chemotherapy included anaemia (7.3%), neutropaenia (3.7%), and anorexia (3.7%). The toxicity level was acceptable, although the results did not meet our criterion for feasibility. Modification of the treatment schedule for S-1 chemotherapy might improve the treatment compliance.
