To determine whether diabetes status, including prediabetes, is associated with increased risk of peripheral neuropathy as defined by monofilament insensitivity. This study used data from the 1999-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (After adjustment compared with no diabetes, prediabetes [RR 1.11 (95% CI 0.92-1.34)] and undiagnosed diabetes [1.08 (0.73-1.61)] were associated with modest increases in risk of peripheral neuropathy, and diabetes was associated with a 74% higher risk of peripheral neuropathy [1.74 (1.50-2.01)]. Diabetes is associated with increased risk of peripheral neuropathy defined by monofilament insensitivity, but prediabetes and undiagnosed diabetes may be associated with only a modest increase in risk.
