This study evaluated powdered burn wound dressing materials from wild silkworm fibroin in an animal model. Fifteen rats were used in this experiment. Full-thickness 2*2 cm burn wounds were created on the back of rats under anesthesia. In the two experimental groups, the wounds were treated with two different dressing materials made from silkworm fibroin. In the Control Group, natural healing without any dressing material was set as control. The wound surface area was measured at five days, seven days and 14 days. Wound healing was evaluated by histologic analysis. By gross observation, there were no infections or severe inflammations through 14 days post-injury. The differences among groups were statistically significant at seven days and 14 days, postoperatively (Burn wound healing was accelerated with silk fibroin spun by wild silkworm
