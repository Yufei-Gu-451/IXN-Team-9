Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare disease with a poor response to chemotherapy. Cisplatin is the most widely investigated drug in the treatment of ACC andPatients with advanced ACC were included in this phase II trial investigating the response to a combination of cisplatin (50 mg mNineteen patients were included in this study. The response rate was 21% (95% CI: 3-39%). No patients obtained a complete response, 32% had stable disease, and 37% progressed while on treatment. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 3 months (95% CI: 0.7-5.3 months) and 1 year PFS was 21% (95% CI: 3-39%). Median survival was 12.5 months (95% CI: 6-19 months). The predominant grade 3/4 toxicity was neutropenia (35%); febrile neutropenia occurred in 5% of cycles. This study could not demonstrate that the combination of cisplatin and docetaxel has higher efficacy than other regimens reported in previous studies.
