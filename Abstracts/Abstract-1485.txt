This study evaluated the sex-specific association of plasma fetuin-A levels with prevalent and incident type 2 diabetes in community-dwelling older adults. Participants were 684 men and 1,058 women (median age, 71 years) whose fetuin-A levels, diabetes prevalence, and diabetes risk factors were evaluated in 1992-1996. The participants were followed for incident diabetes through 2010 (median follow-up, 9 years). Women with impaired glucose tolerance had elevated fetuin-A levels compared with women with normal glucose tolerance (Higher fetuin-A concentrations were independently associated with an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes in older women but were not related to diabetes risk in older men. Fetuin-A may provide novel insights into mechanisms underlying sex differences in glucose homeostasis and diabetes risk in old age.
