Calcific deposits (CaDs) may be related to chronic postoperative pain and may affect function after patellar tendon surgery. Cross-sectional. We hypothesized that patients with CaDs (+CaDs) would rate lower than those without (-CaDs) on measures of knee function and quality of life. Patients completed the Tegner Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale (Lysholm), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), the International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form (IKDC), and the Tegner Activity Level Scale. Sixteen postsurgical and 16 age-matched controls were tested. Patients +CaDs were 5.6 years older than those patients -CaDs and had 4.2 years of longer elapse since surgery. Bilateral patellar tendons were examined for CaDs with musculoskeletal ultrasound imaging. One-way analysis of variance was used to determine if differences existed among patients +CaDs and -CaDs and healthy controls. Hierarchical logistic regressions were used to determine which variables best predicted the presence of CaDs. CaDs were found in 44% (7 of 16) of postsurgical patients, who scored lower than controls on all dimensions of the Lysholm, KOOS, and IKDC. Patients +CaD had lower KOOS scores than controls (symptoms, activities of daily living, and quality of life). Age and time since surgery were both moderately related to the presence of CaDs, and both correctly predicted 71% of patients +CaDs. Calcific deposits were found in the patellar tendon of 44% of postsurgical patients, who rated themselves lower on all subjective measures of knee function and quality of life following surgery. Age is an important factor for developing CaDs postsurgery. Calcific deposits may be present in patellar tendons following surgery, but their direct role in functional or clinical limitations remains unknown.
