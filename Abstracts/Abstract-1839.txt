To analyze the characteristics of the Achilles tendon of rats after induction of localized inflammation in the rat paw. In our study three groups were used: inflamed group with carrageenan in rat paw (G1); saline group (G2) and control group (G3). After 4 hours the animals were euthanized and the Achilles tendon removed. No significant differences were observed in the analysis of non-collagenous proteins, glycosaminoglycans and hydroxyproline in the groups but a tendency of reduction was verified in G1. As regards the organization of collagen molecules, no differences were observed between groups. With respect to MMPs activity, a stronger presence of the active isoform of MMP-2 in G1 was observed, suggesting that the remodeling was occurring. Thus, we conclude that the inflammatory process in rat paw may affect the remodeling of tendons located near the inflamed site.
