Few tools are available to evaluate clinical outcomes and response to thrombolysis (tPA) in stroke patients with diabetes. We explored how the iScore (We applied the iScore to stroke patients presenting to stroke centers participating in the Registry of the Canadian Stroke Network. Main outcomes included favorable outcome, defined as a modified Rankin scale (mRS) 0-2 at discharge, and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) after tPA. Among 12,686 patients with an acute ischemic stroke, 3,228 (25.5%) had diabetes. Among patients receiving tPA (Stroke patients with diabetes have poorer outcomes compared with patients without diabetes, which is not explained by ICH. The iScore similarly predicts response to tPA between stroke patients with and without diabetes.
