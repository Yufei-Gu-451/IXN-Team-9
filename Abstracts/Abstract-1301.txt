To determine the relationship between markers of insulin resistance (fasting insulin and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance), markers of adiposity (BMI, waist circumference, and body fat), HbAOur study sample consisted of 1,172 people aged 35-64 years (49% women), free of diabetes, and recruited between 2005 and 2007 in the MONA LISA survey. Cognitive functions (memory, attention, and processing speed) were evaluated by neuropsychological tests: word-list learning test, digit symbol substitution test (DSST), word fluency test, and Stroop Test. Multiple logistic regressions were used to estimate the relationship between cognitive performance and metabolic markers. We serially adjusted for age, sex, education, and occupational status (model A), additionally for income, smoking, alcohol consumption, sedentarity, and psychotropic substance use (model B), and finally, included variables linked to the metabolic syndrome (hypertension, dyslipidemia, vascular disease, and C-reactive protein) and depression (model C). Elevated markers of adiposity were associated with poor cognitive performance in tests evaluating processing speed. The probability of being in the lowest quartile of each test was nearly doubled for participants in the upper quartile of BMI, compared with those in the lowest one [BMI, adjusted odds ratio (OR) 2.18,Poor cognitive performance is associated with adiposity and hyperglycemia in healthy middle-aged people.
