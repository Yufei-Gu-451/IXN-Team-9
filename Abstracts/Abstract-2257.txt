Albuminuria and reduced kidney function are associated with cognitive impairment. Relationships between nephropathy and cerebral structural changes remain poorly defined, particularly in African Americans (AAs), a population at higher risk for both cognitive impairment and diabetes than European Americans. We examined the relationship between urine albumin:creatinine ratio (UACR), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and cerebral MRI volumes in 263 AAs with type 2 diabetes. Cross-sectional associations between renal parameters and white matter (WM), gray matter (GM), hippocampal, and WM lesion (WML) volumes were assessed using generalized linear models adjusted for age, education, sex, BMI, hemoglobin AParticipants had a mean (SD) age of 60.2 years (9.7 years), and 62.7% were female. Mean diabetes duration was 14.3 years (8.9 years), HbAWe found albuminuria to be a better marker of cerebral structural changes than eGFR in AAs with type 2 diabetes. Relationships between albuminuria and brain pathology may contribute to poorer cognitive performance in patients with mild CKD.
