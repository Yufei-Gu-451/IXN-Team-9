In a pilot accuracy study, stool Xpert testing from 115 children with suspected pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) detected 8/17 (47%) cultureconfirmed tuberculosis cases, including 4/5 (80%) HIV-infected and 4/12 (33%) HIV-uninfected children. Sputum Xpert detected 11/17 (65%) cases. Stool holds promise for PTB diagnosis in HIV-infected children.
