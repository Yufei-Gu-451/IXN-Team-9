Lip canting is associated with facial asymmetry, and is one of the most challenging problems in surgical correction of facial deformities. The author corrected lip canting using bioabsorbable devices during orthognathic surgery. Soft tissue suspension procedures were performed on four patients with facial asymmetry. Lip lines improved for all patients. Over an observation period of five years, no complications were noted, nor did any late relapse develop. Furthermore, as time past, the effect of the Endotine suspension procedure increased probably due to induction of fibrosis on surrounding soft tissues.
