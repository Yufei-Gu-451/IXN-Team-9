Oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) is crucial for tumour suppression. Senescent cells implement a complex pro-inflammatory response termed the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). The SASP reinforces senescence, activates immune surveillance and paradoxically also has pro-tumourigenic properties. Here, we present evidence that the SASP can also induce "paracrine senescence" in normal cells both in culture and in human and mouse models of OIS
