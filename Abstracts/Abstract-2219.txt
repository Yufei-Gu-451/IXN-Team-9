Undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS), previously known as malignant fibrous histiocytoma, occurs commonly in the soft tissues in adult, but is rare in the maxillofacial region. It consists of undifferentiated mesenchymal tumor cells resembling histiocytes and fibroblasts. The purpose of this article is to report a case of UPS in the mandible. A 44-year-old patient presented with a painful growing mass in the mandible of two months' duration. Computed tomography and positron emission tomography-computed tomography revealed an ill-defined heterogenous, hypermetabolic mass about 4 cm in size in the left mandible invading adjacent soft tissues. A left mandiblulectomy and reconstruction with a fibular free flap were performed. Immunohistochemical study gave a diagnosis of UPS. The patient was referred for adjuvant chemotherapy after surgical removal of the tumor.
