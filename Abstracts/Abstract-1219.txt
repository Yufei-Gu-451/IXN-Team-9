MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in essential biological activities, and have been reported to exhibit differential expression profiles in various cancers. Our previous study demonstrated thatBecause predicted target gene analyses revealed that microRNA-125b (miR-125b) potentially regulatesA downregulated expression of miR-125b was found in OSCC-derived cell lines and OSCC samples. The miR-125b-transfected cells showed a decreased proliferation rate, enhanced radiosensitivity to X-ray irradiation and diminishedThese findings suggested that the downregulated miR-125b expression was associated with proliferation and radioresistance mechanisms, probably through ICAM2 signalling. Thus, controlling the expression or activity of miR-125b might contribute to suppressing proliferation and overcoming radioresistance in OSCC.
