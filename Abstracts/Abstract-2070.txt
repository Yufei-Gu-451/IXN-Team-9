We sought to determine whether aerobic exercise training+weight loss (AEX+WL) would affect the expression of myostatin and its relationship with insulin sensitivity in a longitudinal, clinical intervention studyThirty-three obese sedentary postmenopausal women and men (n=17 and 16, age:61+/-1 yrs, BMI:31+/-1 kg/mBody weight (-8%) and fat mass (-17%) decreased after AEX+WL (P less than 0.001). FFM and mid-thigh muscle area by CT did not change but muscle attenuation increased (P less than 0.05). VOExercise and weight loss results in a down-regulation of myostatin mRNA and an improvement in insulin sensitivity in obese older men and women.
