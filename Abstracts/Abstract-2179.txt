Transoral vertical ramus osteotomy (TOVRO) procedure can result in a variety of complications. Complications commonly reported include extensive bleeding due to major blood vessel injury, unpredictable fracture, postoperative infection, neurosensory deficit related Inferior alveolar nerve, insufficient osteosynthesis, and temporomandibular joint problem. The authors describe a case of partial necrosis of the mandibular proximal segment following TOVRO, a rarely reported complication. A 37-year-old otherwise healthy woman underwent Lefort l osteotomy and TOVRO to correct mandibular prognathism. Postoperatively, she developed pain and swelling in the right submandibular region and was found to have a partial necrosis of proximal segment.
