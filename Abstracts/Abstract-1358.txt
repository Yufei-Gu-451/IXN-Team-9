The FAST was a factorial trial in first-line treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), addressing the role of replacing cisplatin with a non-platinum agent. The prognostic and predictive effect of ERCC1/BRCA1 expression andPatients were randomised to receive treatment with or without cisplatin. ERCC1/BRCA1 expression was determined by immunohistochemistry. Tumour samples were available from 110 of 433 patients enrolled: 54.7% were ERCC1 positive and 51.4% were BRCA1 positive. Overall, ERCC1-negative patients had better response rate (This study confirms the prognostic role of ERCC1 expression and XRCC1 (
