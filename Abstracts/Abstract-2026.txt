Family history of cancer is associated with developing nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC); however, the impact of it on survival among established NPC patients remains unknown. We retrospectively analysed 1773 southern Chinese patients. Associations between a first-degree family history of NPC and overall survival (OS), locoregional relapse-free survival (LRFS) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) were estimated by Cox regression. Among 1773 patients, 207 (11.7%) reported a first-degree family history of NPC. Compared with patients without a family history, the adjusted hazard ratios among those with it were 0.60 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.37-0.98;A first-degree family history of NPC is associated with improved survival of patients.
