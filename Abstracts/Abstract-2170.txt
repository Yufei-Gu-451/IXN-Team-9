To examine associations between exposure to prenatal smoking and early-life changes in fat mass (FM), fat-free mass (FFM) and anthropometrics. We analyzed 670 mother-offspring pairs in the longitudinal Healthy Start study. Maternal smoking data were collected during prenatal research visits. Offspring body composition and size were measured by air displacement plethysmography at delivery and postnatal follow-up (5 months) visits. Comparing exposed and unexposed offspring, exposure to prenatal smoking was significantly associated with reduced neonatal FM (Exposure to prenatal smoking was significantly associated with rapid postnatal growth, which may increase the offspring's risk of metabolic diseases.
