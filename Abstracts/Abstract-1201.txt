Laryngotracheal trauma is a rare condition that accounts for less than 1% of blunt trauma. Laryngotracheal fractures are uncommon in sports, even in settings where athletes are more vulnerable, including football, basketball, and hockey. If a laryngeal injury is suspected, immediate evaluation is required to avoid a delay in the diagnosis of a potentially life-threatening injury. A collegiate basketball player sustained an unusual fracture involving the cricoid and thyroid cartilage during practice. This case illustrates the importance of rapid identification and early management of patients with blunt laryngotracheal trauma in sports.
