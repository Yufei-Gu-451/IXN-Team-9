Develop a model that allowed the study of bone regeneration in infection conditions. A 15 mm defect was surgically created in the rabbit ulna and inoculated with 5x10Bone regeneration was inferior to 25% of the defect in radiological and histological analysis. Infected bone defect of 15 mm in the rabbit ulna was unable to achieve full regeneration without further treatment.
