To develop and validate a risk engine that calculates the risks of macro- and microvascular complications in type 2 diabetes. We analyzed pooled data from two clinical trials on 1,748 Japanese type 2 diabetic patients without diabetes complications other than mild diabetic retinopathy with a median follow-up of 7.2 years. End points were coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, noncardiovascular mortality, overt nephropathy defined by persistent proteinuria, and progression of retinopathy. We fit a multistate Cox regression model to derive an algorithm for prediction. The predictive accuracy of the calculated 5-year risks was cross-validated. Sex, age, HbAThe risk engine accurately predicts macro- and microvascular complications and would provide helpful information in risk classification and health economic simulations.
