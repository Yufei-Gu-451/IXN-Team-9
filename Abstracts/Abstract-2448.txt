Determining the chamber of origin of focal atrial tachycardias (FATs) arising at or close to the septum might require biatrial mapping. This review focuses on the available tools and methods used to distinguish right atrial from left atrial origin before left atrial access is obtained. These include analysis of P wave morphology, assessing the timing of right atrial septal activation, the sequence of right atrial and/or biatrial activation and analysis of earliest electrogram morphology. The electroanatomical properties of the interatrial septum and coronary sinus that provide the basis for the above mentioned tools have also been briefly described.
