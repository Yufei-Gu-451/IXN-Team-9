The goal of this study is to examine participant responses to disclosure of genetic results in a minority population at high-risk for depression and anxiety. 82 subjects in a genetic study of nicotine dependence were offered personalized genetic results: all were nicotine dependent and 64% self-identified as African American. Pathway Genomics was used to evaluate genetic risks for 5 complex diseases. Participants returned 4-8 weeks following enrollment for in-person genetic counseling interviews and evaluation of baseline measures. A telephone follow-up was performed 4-8 weeks later to assess responses to results. 50 of the 82 subjects (61%) were interested in receiving genetic results. These participants had multiple risk factors, including high baseline measures of depression (66%) and anxiety (32%), as well as low rates of employment (46%), adequate health literacy (46%), and health insurance (45%). Pathway Genomics reported "increased risk" for at least one disease in 77% of subjects. 95% of participants reported that they appreciated the genetic results, and receiving these results was not associated with changes in symptoms of depression or anxiety. Furthermore, after return of genetic results, smoking cessation attempts increased (p=0.003). Even in an underserved population at high-risk for adverse psychological reactions, subjects responded positively to personalized genetic results.
