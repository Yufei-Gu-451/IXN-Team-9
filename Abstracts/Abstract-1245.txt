Oleanolic acid (OA), a natural component of many plant food and medicinal herbs, is endowed with a wide range of pharmacological properties whose therapeutic potential has only partly been exploited until now. Throughout complex and multifactorial mechanisms, OA exerts beneficial effects against diabetes and metabolic syndrome. It improves insulin response, preserves functionality and survival of beta-cells, and protects against diabetes complications. OA may directly modulate enzymes connected to insulin biosynthesis, secretion, and signaling. However, its major contributions appear to be derived from the interaction with important transduction pathways, and many of its effects are consistently related to activation of the transcription factor Nrf2. Doing that, OA induces the expression of antioxidant enzymes and phase II response genes, blocks NF-kappaB, and represses the polyol pathway, AGEs production, and hyperlipidemia. The management of type 2 diabetes requires an integrated approach, which includes the early intervention to prevent or delay the disease progression, and the use of therapies to control glycemia and lipidemia in its late stages. In this sense, the use of functional foods or drugs containing OA is, undoubtedly, an interesting path.
