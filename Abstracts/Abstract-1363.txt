We recently isolated vasohibin-1 (VASH1), a novel angiogenic molecule that is specifically expressed in activated vascular endothelial cells (ECs), and the status of VASH1 expression has been documented in various cancer angiogenesis. The aim of this study was to assess the prognostic value of VASH1 expression in prostate cancer (PCa). In this study, we retrospectively analysed the clinical records and evaluated the VASH1 expression of tumour microvessels in 167 patients with PCa who underwent radical prostatectomy. We immunohistochemically examined the microvessels positive for anti-CD34 as microvessel density (MVD) and the microvessels with activated ECs positive for VASH1 density. We found that the VASH1 expression was restricted to ECs in the tumour stroma. VASH1 density was significantly associated with pathological T stage, Gleason score and MVD. The 5-year PSA recurrence-free survival rate was 58.8% in patients with higher VASH1 density (?12 per mmVASH1 density represents a clinically relevant predictor of patient prognosis and can be a new biomarker that would provide additional prognostic information in PCa.
