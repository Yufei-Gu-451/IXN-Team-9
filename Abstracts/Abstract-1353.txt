Recent data indicate that tumour microenvironment, which is influenced by inflammatory cells, has a crucial role in cancer progression and clinical outcome of patients. In the present study, we investigated the prognostic relevance of preoperative neutrophil/lymphocyte (N/L) ratio on time to tumour recurrence (TTR) and overall survival (OS) in soft-tissue sarcoma (STS) patients who underwent curative surgical resection. In all, 260 STS patients were included in this retrospective study. Kaplan-Meier curves and multivariate Cox proportional models were calculated for TTR and OS. In univariate analysis, elevated N/L ratio was significantly associated with decreased TTR (hazard ratio (HR), 2.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.30-4.14;In conclusion, our findings suggest that an elevated preoperative N/L ratio predicts poor clinical outcome in STS patients and may serve as a cost-effective and broadly available independent prognostic biomarker.
