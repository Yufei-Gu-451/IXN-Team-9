Recent large-scale prospective studies suggest that long telomeres are associated with an increase cancer risk, counter to conventional wisdom. To further clarify the association between leukocyte telomere length (LTL) and prostate cancer, and assess genetic variability in relation to both LTL and prostate cancer, we performed a nested case-control study (922 cases and 935 controls). The participants provided blood in 1993-1995 and were followed through August 2004 (prostate cancer incidence) or until 28 February 2013 (lethal or fatal prostate cancer). Relative LTL was measured by quantitative PCR and was calculated as the ratio of telomere repeat copy number to a single gene (36B4) copy number (T/S). Genotyping was performed using the TaqMan OpenArray SNP Genotyping Platform. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of all prostate cancer and subtypes defined by Gleason grade, stage and lethality (metastasis or death). We observed a positive association between each s.d. increase in LTL and all (multivariable-adjusted OR 1.11, 95% CI: 1.01-1.22), low-grade (OR 1.13, 95% CI:1.01-1.27), and localised (OR 1.12, 95% CI:1.01-1.24) prostate cancer. Associations for other subtypes were similar, but did not reach statistical significance. In subgroup analyses, associations for high grade and advanced stage (OR=2.04, 95% CI 1.00-4.17;In this prospective study, longer LTL was modestly associated with higher risk of prostate cancer. A stronger association for more aggressive cancer in men with a family history of the disease needs to be confirmed in larger studies.
