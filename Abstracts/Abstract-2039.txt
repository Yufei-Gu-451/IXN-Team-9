Tumour-released DNA in blood represents a promising biomarker for cancer detection. Although epigenetic alterations such as aberrant promoter methylation represent an appealing perspective, the discordance existing between frequencies of alterations found in DNA extracted from tumour tissue and cell-free DNA (cfDNA) has challenged their practical clinical application. With the aim to explain this bias of agreement, we investigated whetherA quantitative methylation-specific PCR was used to analyse a selected CpG site in theTheOur findings provide new insight into biological aspects modulating the concordance between tissues and plasma methylation profiles.
