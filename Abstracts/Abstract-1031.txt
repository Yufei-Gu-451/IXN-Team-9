To examine variability in diagnosed gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) prevalence at delivery by race/ethnicity and state. We used data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project State Inpatient Databases for 23 states of the United States with available race/ethnicity data for 2008 to examine age-adjusted and race-adjusted rates of GDM by state. We used multilevel analysis to examine factors that explain the variability in GDM between states. Age-adjusted and race-adjusted GDM rates (per 100 deliveries) varied widely between states, ranging from 3.47 in Utah to 7.15 in Rhode Island. Eighty-six percent of the variability in GDM between states was explained as follows: 14.7% by age; 11.8% by race/ethnicity; 5.9% by insurance; and 2.9% by interaction between race/ethnicity and insurance at the individual level; 17.6% by hospital level factors; 27.4% by the proportion of obese women in the state; 4.3% by the proportion of Hispanic women aged 15-44 years in the state; and 1.5% by the proportion of white non-Hispanic women aged 15-44 years in the state. Our results suggest that GDM rates differ by state, with this variation attributable to differences in obesity at the population level (or "at the state level"), age, race/ethnicity, hospital, and insurance.
