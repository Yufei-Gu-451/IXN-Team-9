Lysine is a ubiquitous residue on protein surfaces. Post translational modifications of lysine, including methylation to the mono-, di- or trimethylated amine result in chemical and structural alterations that have major consequences for protein interactions and signalling pathways. Small molecules that bind to methylated lysines are potential tools to modify such pathways. To make progress in this direction, detailed structural data of ligands in complex with methylated lysine is required. Here, we report a crystal structure of
