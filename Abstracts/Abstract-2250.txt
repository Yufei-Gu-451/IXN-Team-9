The objective of this study was to determine a classification system for BN in incarcerated groin hernia patients and to explore the possible relationship between BN staging and patient outcomes. Incarcerated groin hernia patients treated with emergency bowel resection from January 2008 to December 2013 were screened for inclusion in a prospective study. A novel three-stage classification system was proposed for BN (BN stages I-III) and correlations between adverse events (AEs) and mortality with BN stage were determined. A total of 108 patients were included, with 71, 26, and 11 patients in BN stages I, II, and III, respectively. AEs, which included wound and intra-abdominal infections and other systemic complications, increased with higher BN stage (all
