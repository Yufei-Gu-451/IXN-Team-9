We examined if chronic cannabis smoking is associated with hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance, reduced beta-cell function, or dyslipidemia in healthy individuals. In a cross-sectional, case-control study, we studied cannabis smokers (Self-reported cannabis use was: 9.5 (2-38) years; joints/day: 6 (3-30) [median (range)]. Carbohydrate intake and percent calories from carbohydrates, but not total energy intake, were significantly higher in cannabis smokers. There were no group differences in percent total body fat, or hepatic fat, but cannabis smokers had a higher percent abdominal visceral fat (18 +/- 9 vs. 12 +/- 5%;Chronic cannabis smoking was associated with visceral adiposity and adipose tissue insulin resistance but not with hepatic steatosis, insulin insensitivity, impaired pancreatic beta-cell function, or glucose intolerance.
