Adipokines are secreted from adipose tissue, influence energy homeostasis and may contribute to the association between obesity and hypertension. Among 1,897 participants enrolled in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, we examined associations between blood pressure and leptin, tumor necrosis factor - alpha [TNFalpha], resistin and total adiponectin. The mean age and body mass index was 64.7 years and 28.1 respectively, and 50% were female. After adjustment for risk factors, a 1-standard deviation increment higher leptin level was significantly associated with higher systolic (5.0 mmHg), diastolic (1.9), mean arterial (2.8) and pulse pressures (3.6), as well as a 34% higher odds for being hypertensive (p less than 0.01 for all). These associations were not materially different when the other adipokines, as well as body mass index, waist circumference or waist to hip ratio, were additionally added to the model. Notably, the associations between leptin and hypertension were stronger in men, but were not different by race/ethnic group, body mass index or smoking status. Adiponectin, resistin and TNFalpha were not independently associated with blood pressure or hypertension. Higher serum leptin, but not adiponectin, resistin or TNFalpha, is associated with higher levels of all measures of blood pressure, as well as a higher odds of hypertension, independent of risk factors, anthropometric measures and other selected adipokines.
