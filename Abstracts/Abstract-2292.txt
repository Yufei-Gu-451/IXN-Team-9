To measure FDG uptake in visceral (VAT) and subcutaneous (SAT) adipose tissue of metabolically healthy obese (MHO) and metabolically abnormal obese (MAO) compared to metabolically healthy lean (MHL) subjects. Given that MHO have increased metabolic risk, we hypothesized that MHO and MAO display similar VAT FDG uptake. We examined 18F-FDG-PET/CT studies of 141 adults (n=60 MHL, n=20 MHO, n=61 MAO) to determine VAT and SAT volumes and FDG uptake. Data on CVD risk factors (BMI, abdominal circumference, blood pressure, serum lipids, and fasting plasma glucose) were collected. MHO and MAO had similar VAT FDG uptake (FDG uptake in VAT of MHO is similar to MAO and lower than MHL, suggesting these subjects may present similar VAT dysfunction.
