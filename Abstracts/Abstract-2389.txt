All forms of diabetes are characterized by a loss of functional beta-cell mass, and strategies for expanding beta-cell mass could have significant therapeutic benefit. We have recently identified the transcription factor Nkx6.1 as an essential maintenance factor of the functional beta-cell state. In addition, Nkx6.1 has been proposed to control beta-cell proliferation, but a role for Nkx6.1 in regulating beta-cell mass has not been demonstrated. Here, we show that Nkx6.1 is required for postnatal beta-cell mass expansion. Genetic inactivation of
