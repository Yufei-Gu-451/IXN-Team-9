Development of critical limb ischemia (CLI) has been reported as an independent predictor of cardiac mortality in diabetic patients. We aimed to determine whether CLI, managed in a structured setting of close collaboration between different vascular specialists and treated with early endovascular intervention, has any impact on long-term cardiac mortality of diabetic patients initially presenting with symptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD). We designed a prospective observational study of 764 consecutive diabetic patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in whom development of CLI was assessed by a dedicated diabetic foot clinic. Cardiac mortality at 4-year follow-up was the primary end point of the study. Among the 764 patients, 111 (14%) developed CLI (PCI-CLI group) and underwent revascularization of 145 limbs, with procedural success in 140 (96%). PCI-CLI patients at baseline had lower left ventricular ejection fraction (51 +/- 11% vs. 53 +/- 10%,The development of promptly assessed and aggressively treated CLI was not significantly associated with increased risk of long-term cardiac mortality in diabetic patients initially presenting with symptomatic CAD.
