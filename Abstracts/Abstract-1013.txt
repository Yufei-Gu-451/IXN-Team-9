Women exhibit exaggerated renal hemodynamic responses to hyperglycemia, which may promote kidney disease progression. Our aim was to determine if increased nitric oxide generation byRenal function, blood pressure, and plasma cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) were measured in 20 men and 15 women with type 1 diabetes mellitus during clamped euglycemia and clamped hyperglycemia. Renal function, blood pressure, and plasma cGMP responses to graded infusions of intravenousSubjects were young, normotensive, normoalbuminuric men and women who adhered to a high-sodium, moderate-protein diet. Plasma cGMP levels during euglycemia were generally lower in men compared with women, and systolic blood pressure (SBP) was higher in men. In response to hyperglycemia, cGMP levels did not change in men but did decline in women (Delta-1.10 +/- 0.20 vs. Delta+0.05 +/- 0.20 pmol/L, between-group effect of hyperglycemia on cGMP;
