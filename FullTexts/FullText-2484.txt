Wilms tumour (WT; OMIM 194070) arises from the developmental kidney (Rivera and Haber, 2005). Wilms tumour and retinoblastoma are typical embryonal tumours. TheWT1gene was altered in less than 25% of sporadic WTs (HarutaNone, 2012), whereas theRB1gene was shown to be altered in greater than 90% of hereditary and non-hereditary retinoblastoma (LeidermanNone, 2007), indicating genetic heterogeneity and homogeneity of WT and retinoblastoma, respectively. Bilateral WT is thought to be hereditary, and the germinal mutation ofWT1located in 11p13 and alterations of 11p15 were reported in 17-38% and 55%, respectively, of bilateral WTs in the series reported from USA, UK and Australia (Huff, 1998;ScottNone, 2012;HuNone, 2013). Carriers withWT1mutations are now increasing because multidisciplinary therapies have improved the survival rates of patients with bilateral WTs and those with a unilateral WT (UWT) with aWT1germline mutation (Royer-PokoraNone, 2008;HuNone, 2013). The penetrance rates ofWT1-mutant familial WT (FWT) are needed for genetic counselling of WT survivors. However, investigators have never examined the incidence ofWT1and 11p15 abnormalities in bilateral WTs of East Asian children, and have not yet tried to estimate the penetrance rates ofWT1-mutant FWT. WT1 is a multifunctional protein that acts as a transcriptional activator or repressor, is predominantly expressed in the embryonic kidney, and plays a pivotal role in its development (Huff, 2011). Insulin-like growth factor II (IGF2; OMIM 147470) is an imprinted gene expressed by the paternal allele, and encodes a foetal polypeptide growth factor (FoulstoneNone, 2005). In contrast,WT1is biallelically expressed in normal foetal tissues and WTs (LittleNone, 1992). The loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and loss of imprinting (LOI) ofIGF2have been reported in 30-40% and 30-70% of sporadic WTs, respectively, and these alterations cause the overexpression ofIGF2, which is involved in Wilms tumorigenesis (SchroederNone, 1987;RavenelNone, 2001;HarutaNone, 2008). BothWT1andIGF2genes are located on the short arm of chromosome 11 (11p) and uniparental disomy (UPD) on 11p, involving either the region limited to 11p15 or that including both 11p15 and 11p13, is regularly accompanied by maternal allele loss and paternal allele duplication (SchroederNone, 1987). We previously reported that small homozygousWT1mutations and paternal UPD (pUPD) of 11p occurred in one-third of unilateral and bilateral WTs with variousWT1abnormalities (HarutaNone, 2008). Based on these genetic findings of human WT,HuNone(2011)showed that the combined occurrence of the upregulation ofIgf2and ablation ofWt1resulted in WT in transgenicWt1-Igf2mice; however, the upregulation ofIgf2or ablation ofWt1by themselves did not lead to malignant tumours . The inheritance ofWT1mutations have been poorly studied in FWTs, and only 13 hereditary WT families withWT1abnormalities have been described in the literature (Yunis and Ramsay, 1980;Kousseff and Agatucci, 1981;NakagomeNone, 1984;LavedanNone, 1989;PelletierNone, 1991;KaplinskyNone, 1996;JeanpierreNone, 1998;Pritchard-JonesNone, 2000;ShibataNone, 2002;ZirnNone, 2005;RegevNone, 2008;FenclNone, 2012;MelchiondaNone, 2013). In addition, the parental origins ofde novosmallWT1mutations and large 11p13 deletions encompassingWT1were reported previously in two and eight individuals, respectively (HuffNone, 1990;NordenskjoldNone, 1994). The aim of the present study was to determine the incidence rates ofWT1andIGF2abnormalities in bilateral WTs in Japanese children, and was to compare the results with those reported in bilateral WTs of Caucasian children. In addition, we summarised the present and previous findings on the penetrance rate for children who inherited various types ofWT1abnormalities from their fathers or mothers, or hadde novo WT1 (DNWT1)abnormalities that occurred in the paternal or maternal germ cell, and tried to clarify whether parental inheritance andWT1abnormality types may affect the penetrance rate of hereditary WT. Forty-five tumour samples were available from 31 Japanese infants or children with bilateral WT, ranging in age between 2 and 26 months, who underwent surgery or biopsy between August 1996 and 2011 (Table 1); 11 of the 45 tumours and 7 of the 31 patients were described in a previous series of patients withWT1-mutant WT (ShibataNone, 2002;HarutaNone, 2008). In one of the seven patients, data on the 11p15 status was added and shown as Bilateral Wilms tumour 23 (BWT23) (Table 1;ShibataNone, 2002). In addition, five patients, including one with UWT of aDNWT1mutation (UWTG1), one with familial and UWTG2, one with Wilms tumour-aniridia-genitourinary malformation-mental retardation (WAGR) syndrome-associated UWTG8 and two with sporadic and UWTS1 and 5 were incorporated into our previous study for a comparison of the data with those ofWT1-mutant bilateral WTs (Table 2). Normal tissue samples were obtained from either peripheral blood (PB) or normal renal tissue adjacent to the tumour from the same patients. Tumours were staged according to the National Wilms Tumor Study Group (NWTS) staging system and most patients were treated according to the NWTS protocols (D'AngioNone, 1989;OueNone, 2009). Malformations found in patients with bilateral WT are listed inTable 1. None of the patients in the present study showed hemihypertrophy or malformations associated with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS; OMIM#130650). One (BWT9) died of the disease, another (BWT27) with premature chromatid separation (PCS) syndrome died of infection (MatsuuraNone, 2006) and 29 were alive at the last follow-up. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee at Saitama Cancer Center, and written informed consent was obtained from parents for samples from the Japan Wilms Tumor Study Group (JWiTS;OueNone, 2009). Since written informed consent was not obtained in a subset of patients collected before 2001, identifying information was removed prior to their analysis, in accordance with the Ethical Guidelines for Clinical Research enacted by the Japanese Government. The Ethics Committee approved the waiver of written informed consent for the latter samples. The diagnosis of WT was made in all 45 tumours, with routine haematoxylin and eosin-stained pathology slides by pathologists at each institution or the JWiTS pathology panel according to the classification proposed by the Japanese Society of Pathology (The committee on histological classification of childhood tumors, 2008). In addition, a pathological review of 29 tissue specimens was performed by the JWiTS pathology panel. Copy number and LOH analysis using single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) arrays, Affymetrix Mapping 50K-Xba and 250K-Nsp arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) was conducted as described previously (HarutaNone, 2008). Copy numbers and LOH were calculated using CNAG and AsCNAR programmes with paired or anonymous references as controls (NannyaNone, 2005;YamamotoNone, 2007). GrossWT1deletions were analysed by Southern blotting using aWT1cDNA probe andBCL1in chromosome band 11q13, or by SNP arrays or the multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) method (Salsa MLPA kit, MRC-Holland, Amsterdam, the Netherlands). To detect smallWT1mutations, defined as missense, nonsense, frame-shift or splice-site mutations, all coding exons including flanking intronic sequences ofWT1were amplified from genomic DNA by PCR, and PCR products were directly sequenced with the BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). We determined the methylation status of 11p15 region in tumour and PB samples by combined bisulfite restriction assay (COBRA;WatanabeNone, 2006) and/or methylation specific (MS)-MLPA (Salsa MS-MLPA kit, ME030BWS/SRS) assay. Combined bisulfite restriction assay of CTCF6 atH19-differentially methylated region (H19-DMR) showed that the mean methylation percentage +/-2 s.d. of five normal kidney and two PB samples was 53.6+/-5.6%, and we defined more than the mean percentage +2 s.d. as the hypermethylated state. Methylation specific-MLPA analysis was used to detect the methylation status of the IC1 (H19-DMR) and IC2 (KvDMR) regions. The methylation statuses were defined according to the manufacturer's instructions. Differences in the incidence of clinical and genetic characteristics between any two genetic subtypes of tumours were examined by thechi2or Fisher's exact test. P less than 0.05 (two-sided) was considered statistically significant. The Student'st-test or Mann-Whitney test was used to compare mean ages between patients withWT1-mutant bilateral WT and those withWT1-mutant sporadic and UWT, between patients with sporadic and UWT with a smallWT1mutation and those with sporadic and UWT with a largeWT1deletion, or between patients with paternal inheritance of a smallWT1mutation and those with maternal inheritance of a smallWT1mutation. Of 45 bilateral tumours from 31 patients, 35 tumours from 25 (81%) patients hadWT1abnormalities; 30 tumours from 21 patients showed small mutations in 1WT1allele and the same small mutation in the otherWT1allele, caused by UPD on 11p (Table 1). One tumour (BWT3R) with deletion flanking exons 1-5 also had UPD on 11p, and was added to the above 30 tumours because of the small deletion. Combined bisulfite restriction assay and/or MS-MLPA identified hypermethylation ofH19-DMR, which indicated the paternal origin ofIGF2UPD in all 31 tumours except 1 whose tumour DNA was not available (BWT21R). The remaining four tumours from three patients had large deletions encompassingWT1in oneWT1allele and a frame-shift or splice-site mutation (three tumours; BWT2R, 9L and 22R) or a small deletion spanning exons 4-9 (one tumour; BWT2L) in the otherWT1allele. All four tumours had the retention of heterozygosity (ROH) on 11p, and had normally methylated CTCF6 atH19-DMR, indicating retention ofIGF2imprinting (ROI). The methylation status of CTCF6 atH19-DMR in PB was examined in 13 of the 25 patients. All 13 patients showed the normal methylation in PB, indicating somatic origin of UPD on 11p15. To compareWT1andIGF2statuses between 35WT1-mutant bilateral WTs and 10WT1-mutant syndromic or familial UWTs or 20WT1-mutant sporadic and UWTs, we combined our published and unpublished data onWT1-mutant WTs and presented them inTable 2. One (BWT21R) of the 35 WTs and one (UWTG1) of the 10 WTs, in which 11p UPD was identified by SNP array but methylation status ofH19-DMR was not examined, were included in each group of tumours with smallWT1mutation and pUPD ofIGF2because all 30WT1-mutant bilateral WTs with 11p UPD examined in the present study showed the hypermethylation indicating paternal 11p UPD, and the previous study indicated loss of maternal 11p allele in WTs with 11p LOH (SchroederNone, 1987). Of the 10 patients, 5 (UWTG1-5) had small homozygousWT1mutations and pUPD on 11p, whereas 5 (UWTG6-10) associated with WAGR syndrome had large deletions in 1WT1allele and small mutations in the otherWT1allele withIGF2ROH/ROI in the tumours (Table 2). Of the 20 patients, 5 (UWTS1-5) had small homozygousWT1mutations and pUPD on whole 11p in the tumours, whereas none of the remaining 15 (UWTS6-15) had the smallWT1mutations and pUPD on 11p; 12 hadIGF2ROI, 2 had pUPD limited to the 11p15 region and 1 had monosomy 11 of paternal origin in the tumours (Table 2). Thus, a homozygousWT1mutation with pUPD on 11p was more frequent in 35WT1-mutant bilateral WTs than in 10WT1-mutant syndromic or familial UWTs (P=0.017) or 20WT1-mutant sporadic and UWTs (P=3.0E-06). When we analysed the 3 groups of patients withWT1-mutant WTs, the mean age of 25 patients with bilateral WT was 12.4 months, that of 10 patients with syndromic or familial and UWT was 14.3 months and that of 20 patients with sporadic UWT was 25.6 months. The 25 and 10 patients were younger than the 20 patients, respectively (P=0.001 andP=0.006), whereas no difference in age was found between the 25 and 10 patients (P=0.286). When we selected the 20 patients with sporadic and UWTs, the mean age of 5 patients with homozygousWT1mutations and paternal 11p UPD was 13.2 months and that of 15 patients with large deletions encompassingWT1with or without pUPD limited to the 11p15 region in the tumours was 29.7 months. The 5 patients with homozygousWT1mutations and pUPD on 11p were younger than the 15 patients with large 11p13 deletions (P=0.002). Ten bilateral tumours from six patients had wild-typeWT1; six tumours had +12, and 2 had 1q+, +6, +8. or pUPD of whole chromosome 11 and one had pUPD of 11p (Table 1). None of the six patients showed characteristics of BWS. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms analysis and COBRA of CTCF6 atH19-DMR and/or MS-MLPA revealed pUPD on 11p or whole chromosome 11 in three tumours, ROI ofIGF2in four and LOI of IGF2in three (Table 1). Of three tumours with pUPD on 11p or whole chromosome 11, the corresponding PB showed normal methylation atH19-DMR in one (BWT30L) and was not available in two; in one of the two, the contralateral tumour had ROH/ROI (BWT31R), denying the constitutional 11p15 UPD (BWT31L). Of three tumours with LOI ofIGF2, the corresponding PB showed normal methylation atH19-DMR in one (BWT29) and was not available in two bilateral WTs (BWT28L, 28R) from one patient, not denying the possibility of constitutional hypermethylation of maternalH19-DMR (Table 1). Of 27 tumours, whose methylation status at IC2 was examined by MS-MLPA, 26 and 1 showed hypomethylation and normal methylation, respectively; the results were consistent with pUPD and LOI of 11p15, respectively. Of 29WT1-mutant bilateral WTs, which were available for pathological review, 25 and 4 tissue specimens were obtained before and after chemotherapy, respectively. Of the 25 tumours, 12 were classified as the mesenchymal type; 4 and 2 of the 12 also had intra-lobar nephrogenic rests (ILNR) and foetal rhabdomyomatous nephroblastoma, respectively, 11 were classified as the mixed type; 1 also had ILNR, 1 was classified as nephroblastoma with ILNR and 1 was classified as ILNR only. Of 4 specimens obtained after chemotherapy, 3 were classified as the mesenchymal type; one also had ILNR, and one as nephroblastoma with ILNR. Of sevenWT1-wild-type bilateral WTs from six patients, which were available for pathological review, five and two specimens were obtained before and after chemotherapy, respectively. Of the five tumours, two (BWT28, and 29) were classified as the epithelial type, two (BWT26 and 30) as the mixed type and one (BWT27) as the mesenchymal type. While the mesenchymal and mixed types were found in bothWT1-mutant andWT1-wild-type bilateral WTs, the epithelial type was only found inWT1-wild-type bilateral WTs. Two specimens obtained after chemotherapy showed either the mixed or mesenchymal type. None of the tumour specimens from 31 patients exhibited features of focal or diffuse anaplasia. We summarised 22 children from 14 families who inheritedWT1mutation/deletion from their mothers or fathers, and 8 children who hadde novolarge deletion encompassingWT1of known parental germ cell origin from the present study and literatures listed in PubMed. The 22 individuals included 3 patients with WTs (FWT4-1, 4-3 and FWT12-1;Figure 1,Table 3); although molecular analyses have not been done in their PB and tumour samples, the pedigrees showed that the 3 patients who developed WT were thought to inheritWT1mutations/deletions from their father or mother. Identical twins (DNWT9-1, 2) in this study shared the same nonsense mutation in PB and tumour samples (Table 3). Because their parents had noWT1mutation in PB, SNP array analysis was performed on 10 polymorphic markers aroundWT1to identify the parental origin of theDNWT1mutation using PB from the parents and twins as well as tumour samples. Because the maternally derived loci identified by SNP markers (SNP A 1946935, 2241668, 4231943 and seven others) were lost in the tumour with UPD on 11p, the paternal germ cell origin of the mutation was determined (Table 3). In addition, two patients (DNWT10, 11) were reported to have small homozygousWT1mutations of paternal germ cell origin in tumours (NordenskjoldNone, 1994). These four patients with smallDNWT1mutations of paternal germ cell origin (DNWT9-1, 9-2, 10 and 11) were excluded from the penetrance analysis, because unaffected carriers with smallDNWT1mutations could not be evaluated. In contrast, eight children with largede novo11p13 deletions (DNWT1-8) were included in the analysis as carriers without development of WT could be evaluated (Figure 1;HuffNone, 1990). All nine patients who inherited a smallWT1mutation from their fathers developed WT; a girl (FWT6-2) was excluded from the penetrance analysis because she died of renal failure at the age of 23 weeks before the possible development of WT (PelletierNone, 1991;KaplinskyNone, 1996;JeanpierreNone, 1998;ShibataNone, 2002;FenclNone, 2012). Of nine WTs with the paternal inheritance ofWT1mutation, four tumours [FWT1 (BWT23L, 23R), 2-1, 2-2] in this study showed homozygousWT1mutations and pUPD on 11p, and two (FWT3, 4-2) showed homozygousWT1mutations, suggesting that the six tumours may have had the sameWT1andIGF2abnormalities (Figure 1andTable 3). Of 6 individuals who inherited smallWT1mutations from their mothers, 4 developed WT; in addition to the small germline mutation in 1 allele 1 had a 26 base-pair deletion that differed from the first mutation (FWT7-1), 1 had a large 11p13 deletion (FWT7-2), 1 had a wild-typeWT1(FWT10) in the other allele in their tumours and theWT1status in the tumour was not examined in the last patient (FWT8-1;Pritchard-JonesNone, 2000;ZirnNone, 2005;RegevNone, 2008;MelchiondaNone, 2013). Thus, all three patients who inherited theWT1mutation from their mothers and whoseWT1status in tumours were examined were not likely to have UPD on 11p in their tumours (Figure 1andTable 3). The mean ages at diagnosis were 14.2 months for the nine patients with the paternal inheritance and 55.3 months for the four patients with the maternal inheritance; the mean age of the nine patients who inherited the mutations from their fathers was younger than that of the four patients who inherited the mutations from their mothers (P=0.011 by Mann-Whitney test). Fifteen individuals from 12 families were shown to have inherited (FWT11-14) orde novolarge 11p13 deletions (DNWT1-8) of paternal or maternal origin (Figure 1andTable 3;Yunis and Ramsay, 1980;Kousseff and Agatucci, 1981;NakagomeNone, 1984;LavedanNone, 1989;HuffNone, 1990;NordenskjoldNone, 1994). All four parents who transmitted large 11p13 deletions had balanced chromosomal insertions involving the 11p13 band. Ten patients developed WTs, on which sequencing analysis ofWT1was not conducted to identify the status of the otherWT1allele in the tumours. Thus, the penetrance rate was 100% (9/9) for individuals who inherited smallWT1mutations from their fathers, and was 67% (14/21) for individuals who inherited smallWT1mutations from their mothers or large 11p13 deletions or hadde novolarge 11p13 deletions irrespective of the parental origin. Thus, the 9 individuals were more likely to develop WT than the 21 individuals (P=0.057). The incidence ofWT1abnormalities in the bilateral WTs of Japanese children was 81%, and this incidence was markedly higher than those reported in American, UK and Australian children (the mean percentage of three series, 32%P=9.4E-05;Table 4;Huff, 1998;ScottNone, 2012;HuNone, 2013). The present series included 31 patients and 45 bilateral WTs, and the UK series included 11 patients and 11 bilateral WTs; the statuses ofWT1and 11p15 were precisely examined in 44 of the 45 and all 11 tumours (Table 4;ScottNone, 2012). The incidence ofWT1abnormality is more frequent in Japanese tumours than in British tumours; however, if we consider that the incidence of WT among Japanese is half of that in Caucasians, the population-based rate of bilateral WT withWT1abnormality may be similar between the two populations (Figure 2). DillerNone(1998)found constitutionalWT1abnormalities in 8 of 157 (5%) American children with a history of WT. Likewise,LittleNone(2004)found constitutionalWT1abnormalities in 6 (2%) of 282 British children with non-syndromic WT. Unfortunately, no studies on constitutionalWT1abnormalities have been performed in Japanese children with WT that precluded the comparison of the incidence of constitutionalWT1abnormalities between the two ethnic populations. In contrast to the equivocal findings in the incidence ofWT1abnormality, that ofIGF2LOI was clearly higher in British children withWT1-wild-type orWT1-wild-type plusWT1-mutant bilateral WT than Japanese counterparts (Table 4andFigure 2;ScottNone, 2012). Thus, it is clear that the incidence ofIGF2LOI in Caucasian bilateral WTs is higher than that in Japanese counterparts, and that the incidence ofWT1wild-type was low in Japanese bilateral WTs. The incidence rates of WT are known to vary, being markedly lower in East Asian children than in their Caucasian counterparts (ParkinNone, 1988). We previously reported that if only sporadic WTs were included, the frequencies of WT withWT1abnormality were similar between East-Asian and Caucasian populations (HarutaNone, 2012). Furthermore, we reported a lower incidence of WT withIGF2LOI in Japanese children than in American children (P=0.041), and we and others proposed that the lower incidence ofIGF2LOI may be one of the reasons for the lower incidence of WT in Japan (FukuzawaNone, 2004;HarutaNone, 2012). Contrary to the equivocal findings in the incidences ofWT1abnormality in sporadic or bilateral WTs between the two populations, the difference in the incidence ofIGF2LOI in bilateral WTs is clear (P=0.036); the relationship is comparative to that ofIGF2LOI in sporadic WTs between the two populations. Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is an imprinting-related growth disorder. Five to 10% of patients with BWS have methylation ofH19-DMR on both parental chromosomes, resulting inIGF2LOI (CerratoNone, 2008). Interestingly, Japanese patients with BWS were shown to have a significantly lower frequency ofH19-DMR hypermethylation than North American and European patients, whereas the incidences of pUPD on 11p15 were comparable, suggesting that susceptibility to epigenetic alterations differs between the two populations (SasakiNone, 2007). The constitutional 11p15 abnormalities in patients with WT were reported from UK and Netherlands. The UK series included 437 patients with non-syndromic WT and found 11p15 abnormalities in 13 (3%) patients; of the 13 patients 4 had bilateral WT and 6 had hypermethylation ofH19-DMR (ScottNone, 2008). The Netherlands series included 109 patients with syndromic or non-syndromic WTs and found 8 (7.3%) children with 11p15 abnormalities; of the 8 patients 3 had bilateral WT, 4 had BWS and 3 had hypermethylation ofH19-DMR (SegersNone, 2012). Of 13 patients whose methylation status ofH19-DMR in PB was examined in the present series, all including 1 (BWT29) withIGF2LOI in the tumour showed the normal methylation pattern. Thus, the involvement of the constitutionalIGF2LOI in Japanese bilateral WTs could not be identified. The same decreased susceptibility to the epigenetic change reported in BWS may have also caused the decreased incidence of bilateral WTs withIGF2LOI (SasakiNone, 2007). The study for constitutional 11p15 abnormalities in Japanese WTs is needed to prove the hypothesis. The present study included six patients having bilateral WTs with wild-typeWT1, and one of them had PCS syndrome, which was caused by aBUB1Bmutation and known to be associated with a predisposition to WT (MatsuuraNone, 2006). The FWT genes,FWT1andFWT2, were located at 17q21 and 19q13, respectively, and the lack of a linkage to these loci in some WT families was reported previously and indicated the existence of additional FWT genes (Ruteshouser and Huff, 2004). Very recently,HanksNone(2014)identified germline mutation of theCTR9gene in 3 of 35 WT families using an exome and sequencing analysis and proposed it as a new WT predisposing gene . These genes may be candidates for germline mutations in the other five patients withWT1-wild-type bilateral WTs in the present series. A previous study showed that theWT1mutations observed in bilateral WT were of germline origin (Huff, 1998). Another study reviewedWT1germline mutations in 117 patients with WTs (Royer-PokoraNone, 2004). Of the 117 patients, 44 had bilateral WT, indicating that a large proportion of germlineWT1mutations are associated with bilateral WT, although the inheritance is not known in all patients. The present study included 25 patients withWT1-mutant bilateral WTs, and the status ofWT1in PB was only examined in 3 patients and 6 parents from 3 families; 2 were shown to have inherited the mutation from their father with or without a past history of WT and 1 was identified to have aDNWT1mutation of paternal germ cell origin. Thus, mutation analyses ofWT1in the PB of patients and their parents are needed to determine whether the mutation is inherited from the parents or occurredde novo. A previous study examined the parental origin ofde novo RB1mutations, and found the paternal origin of the mutation in all patients (DryjaNone, 1989). RegardingDNWT1alterations, we and other researchers found the paternal germ cell origin of the small mutation in four patients and that of the large deletion in seven patients and the maternal germ cell origin of the large deletion in one patient (HuffNone, 1990;NordenskjoldNone, 1994). No studies have reported the maternal germ cell origin ofde novosmallWT1mutations. In a review on human germinal mutations,Crow (2000)described that one marked difference between the human male and female was that there are many more germline cell divisions in the life history of a sperm than that of an egg. In WTs with homozygousWT1mutations and paternalIGF2UPD, theIGF2alteration is thought to be the second genetic event subsequent to theWT1alteration that has been shown to occur in the paternalWT1allele. The result that pUPD on 11p was found in the great majority of bilateral WTs in the present study further supports the paternal germ cell origin ofde novosmallWT1mutations. We summarised the data of all 30 children from 22 families with hereditary WT, whose inheritance of theWT1alteration was described in the present and previous studies (Table 3;Yunis and Ramsay, 1980;Kousseff and Agatucci, 1981;NakagomeNone, 1984;LavedanNone, 1989;PelletierNone, 1991;KaplinskyNone, 1996;JeanpierreNone, 1998;Pritchard-JonesNone, 2000;ShibataNone, 2002;ZirnNone, 2005;RegevNone, 2008;FenclNone, 2012;MelchiondaNone, 2013). We classified 30 children into 3 groups based on parental inheritance of the germline mutation and types ofWT1abnormality, and found that children who inherited smallWT1mutations from their father were more likely to have the higher penetrance rate than those who inherited smallWT1mutations from their mothers or inherited the large deletions or had thede novolarge deletions irrespective of parental origin (P=0.057;Figure 1). Why do parental inheritance andWT1abnormality types affect the penetrance rate? Most parents hadDNWT1mutations of paternal germ cell origin, as shown in (Figure 3A). Children who had a smallWT1mutation of paternal germ cell origin easily developed WT because pUPD on 11p resulted in homozygousWT1mutations and simultaneous overexpression ofIGF2(Figure 3B and C). Children less frequently developed WT by the second mutation in the maternally derivedWT1allele because this tumorigenic pathway needs additional genetic and/or epigenetic events (Figure 3D). In contrast, WTs developed in children who inherited the small mutation from their mothers could not take advantage of simultaneous alterations inWT1andIGF2because maternally derivedIGF2is imprinted and repressed (Figure 3E and F). Children who inherited the small mutations from their mothers could develop WT if an independentWT1mutation occurred in the paternally derivedWT1allele, which resides on the same 11p expressingIGF2; expression even from oneIGF2allele may be important for the development of embryonic tumours (Figure 3G). Regarding the large 11p13 deletion, children who inherited the large deletions or had thede novolarge deletions could develop WT if an independentWT1mutation occurred in the paternally or maternally derived WT1allele (Figure 3K and N). However, large homozygous deletions in the 11p13 chromosomal region caused by UPD on 11p were unlikely to occur in a nephroblast, because of disadvantage for survival with the loss of a large number of genes (Figure 3J and M). In fact, seven tumours developed in patients with WAGR syndrome, in which bothWT1andIGF2statuses were examined, showed large 11p13 deletions in oneWT1allele and small mutations in the other allele and ROH on 11pter-11p13 (BWT2L, BWT2R and UWTG6-10;Tables 1and2). Furthermore, the patients inherited the small mutations from their fathers were younger than those who inherited the small mutations from their mothers, and the patients with a sporadic and UWT with small homozygousWT1mutations and pUPD ofIGF2were younger than those with a sporadic and UWT with the large deletion. These findings indicate that a smallWT1mutation with pUPD on 11p is the most efficient mechanism for WT development. The present result on theWT1andIGF2statuses in bilateral and FWT led to the hypothesis that individuals who inherited smallWT1mutations from their fathers may be more likely to develop WT than those who inherited the small mutations from their mothers or inherited large 11p13 deletions or had thede novolarge deletions irrespective of parental origin. It is obvious that genetic and epigenetic studies in a large number of WT families withWT1mutations are needed to confirm the hypothesis. We believe that if confirmed the present findings are useful for the genetic counselling of individuals, including WT survivors, who may inheritWT1mutations.
