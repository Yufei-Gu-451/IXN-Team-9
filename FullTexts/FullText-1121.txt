Plant development is plastic and environmentally sensitive, and is regulated by hormones acting as long-range signals to integrate developmental, genetic, and environmental inputs. In the control of shoot and root branching, for example, large variations in plant architecture can be generated in a single genotype in response to a number of cues (Domagalska and Leyser, 2011;Muller and Leyser, 2011). The role of classic plant hormones, such as auxin and cytokinins, in the regulation of shoot and root branching and in the maintenance of coordinated growth between root and shoot has been extensively studied (Sachs, 2005;HwangNone., 2012). Recently, strigolactones (SLs) have been identified as a new class of branch-inhibiting hormones that seem to fine-tune the regulation of shoot branching further (Gomez-RoldanNone., 2008;UmeharaNone., 2008;XieNone., 2010). In the past decade, genotypes affected in the SL pathway were identified, and includeramosus(rms) mutants in pea,decreased apical dominance(dad) in petunia,more axillary branch(max) inArabidopsis, andhigh-tillering dwarf(htdord) in rice (Beveridge and Kyozuka, 2009). Besides regulating shoot architecture, SLs contribute to shaping the root system, by affecting primary root length, adventitious root formation, lateral root initiation and subsequent outgrowth, and root hair elongation (Koltai, 2011,2012;Ruyter-SpiraNone., 2011;RasmussenNone., 2012). Moreover, a broad range of developmental roles was postulated for SLs in the alleviation of secondary seed dormancy induced by high temperature (TohNone., 2012), hypocotyl elongation (HuNone., 2010;TsuchiyaNone., 2010), secondary growth (AgustiNone., 2011), light harvesting (Mayzlish-GatiNone., 2010;TsuchiyaNone., 2010), reproductive development (SnowdenNone., 2005;KohlenNone., 2012), and leaf senescence (SnowdenNone., 2005;LedgerNone., 2010). SLs seem to be specifically involved in the establishment of the symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing bacteria in legumes, namely in the formation of indeterminate nodules (SotoNone., 2010;Foo and Davies, 2011;FooNone., 2013). Finally, besides their hormonal role, SLs exuded into the rhizosphere stimulate the germination of parasitic plants (YoneyamaNone., 2010;LechatNone., 2012) and the branching of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) (AkiyamaNone., 2005;BouwmeesterNone., 2007;YoshidaNone., 2012). A recent report suggests that the hormonal effect on the elongation of rhizoids (the equivalent of root hairs in higher plants) in ancestral species of the green lineage pre-dates the exogenous function as signalling molecules in the rhizosphere (DelauxNone., 2012). SLs are a family of carotenoid-derived terpenoid lactones mostly produced in roots (MatusovaNone., 2005). The precursor all-trans-beta-carotene is converted by the recently characterized beta-carotene isomerase D27 into 9-cis-beta-carotene (AlderNone., 2012). The isomerized substrate is then cleaved by two double bond-specific cleavage enzymes (carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases, CCDs), CCD7 and CCD8. The 9', 10' bond of 9-cis-beta-carotene is cleaved by CCD7, yielding beta-ionone (C13) and 10'-apo-beta-carotenal (C27). The latter compound is subsequently cleaved and cyclized by CCD8 into a bioactive SL precursor named carlactone (BookerNone., 2004;SchwartzNone., 2004;AlderNone., 2012). Several orthologues of these two CCDs have been characterized inArabidopsis, pea, petunia, rice, and tomato (MorrisNone., 2001;SorefanNone., 2003;BookerNone., 2004;SnowdenNone., 2005;ZouNone., 2006;AriteNone., 2007;DrummondNone., 2009;VogelNone., 2010;KohlenNone., 2012). CCD8 orthologues are also characterized in kiwifruit, chrysanthemum, maize, and the mossPhyscomitrella patens(LedgerNone., 2010;LiangNone., 2010;ProustNone., 2011;GuanNone., 2012). MAX1, a class-III cytochrome P450 protein ofArabidopsis, has also been proposed to act in the SL biosynthetic pathway, namely converting carlactone into 5-deoxystrigol, but its biochemical action still needs to be resolved experimentally (BookerNone., 2005;AlderNone., 2012). Other genes putatively involved in SL biosynthesis have been identified in several species (SlORT1andAtPPD5), but their exact function is so far unknown (KoltaiNone., 2010None;RooseNone., 2011). No orthologues of any of the above biosynthetic genes have been characterized inLotus japonicusyet. Lotus japonicusis a perennial legume of temperate climates, and a model plant for several developmental processes and interactions with soil (micro)organisms (Handberg and Stougaard, 1992;Lohar and Bird, 2003); the first SL molecule described as a branching factor for AMF, 5-deoxystrigol, was isolated from this plant (AkiyamaNone., 2005). Additionally,L. japonicushas a phyllotaxis distinct from that of other model plants such asArabidopsis, pea, petunia, tomato, and rice. In fact, all of its cotyledonary axillary buds develop immediately into lateral shoots even in very young seedlings. This, and the regular, proliferative accessory (axillary) meristem initiation and immediate development of axillary shoots, makesL. japonicusan attractive experimental model to study the regulation of accessory meristem initiation and development (AlvarezNone., 2006). Namely, how SLs specifically affect the architecture of a plant with this kind of phyllotaxis is not known at present. Also,L. japonicusdevelops determinate nodules, differently from pea andMedicago sativa, the two species investigated so far for the role of SLs in nodulation. In this study, the cloning of theLotusorthologue ofCCD7(LjCCD7), and an overall characterization of its role in the regulation of plant architecture, reproductive development, senescence, and root symbiosis are reported. The results also linkCCD7expression with the regulation of determinate nodulation, reproduction, and senescence inL. japonicus. These latter phenotypes have not been reported so far for anyCCD7orthologue. For transcript quantification and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) cloning purposes, RNA was isolated from freshly harvested tissues of wild-typeL. japonicusecotype Gifu B-129 and transgenic lines in the same background with Tripure reagent (Roche). On-column DNase digestion was performed with an RNase-free DNase kit, and total RNA was further purified by an RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (both Qiagen). RNA quality and integrity were checked by NanoDrop ND-2000 and standard gel electrophoresis. A 1 mug aliquot of total RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA with an iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). RT-qPCRs were set up in 20 mul using the iQ SYBR Green Supermix on the iQ5 Real-Time PCR system (Bio-Rad). LjCCD7-specific primers are listed inSupplementary Table S1available atJXBonline. Ubiquitin (LjUBI) transcript was used as a normalizer (YokotaNone., 2009). Quantification followed the 2-DeltaDeltaCtmethod. The putativeLjCCD7gene was identified based on the EST (expressed sequence tag) in the Kazusa database (http://www.kazusa.or.jp/lotus/) aligning best under BlastP default settings with query sequences fromArabidopsis(GI: 330255400) and pea (GI: 90019042). The SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit (Clontech) was used to amplify the unknown ends of the coding sequence in a cDNA pool fromLotusroots, and cloning was performed using the Advantage 2 PCR enzyme system (Clontech) and primers UPM with GSP1 or GSP2 (Supplementary Table S1atJXBonline). PCR conditions for both cDNA ends were five cycles at 94 degrees C for 30 s, 72 degrees C for 3min; five cycles at 94 degrees C for 30 s, 70 degrees C for 30 s, 72 degrees C for 3min; and 25 cycles at 94 degrees C for 30 s, 68 degrees C for 30 s, and 72 degrees C for 3min. RACE products were electrophoresed, tested with primers NestF and NestR (Supplementary Table S1atJXBonline), cloned in the pGEM-T easy vector (Promega), and sequenced (BMR Genomics, Padova). The full-length sequence ofLjCCD7(1866bp) was assembled virtually with the Vector NTI Advance 11.0 and amplified from the aforementioned cDNA batch with primers LDF and LDR (Supplementary Table S1atJXBonline). The PCR product was cloned into pGEM-T to generate pGEM-T_LjCCD7, and sequenced. The resulting coding sequence is deposited in GenBank (ID: GU441766). For expression inEscherichia coliof glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-LjCCD7, anEcoRI fragment was subcloned from pGEM-T_LjCCD7 into pGEX-5X-3. To generate theLjCCD7silencing vector, a 250bp region (from 1451bp downstream of the transcription start site to the stop codon, within the last exon) was amplified withPfupolymerase (Promega) and primers RNAiF and RNAiR (Supplementary Table S1atJXBonline). The PCR product was directly sequenced and cloned in pDONR221 to generate the entry clone pDONR_LjCCD7. Finally, a single-step Gateway-based reaction was performed with pDONR_LjCCD7 and the destination vector pTKO2 (SnowdenNone., 2005). In parallel, the negative control (NC) construct pTKO2_pENTR was generated with the empty entry vector pENTR4 and the destination vector pTKO2. Both pTKO2_LjCCD7 and pTKO2_pENTR constructs were sequenced with primer pairs 572F/1133R and 1388F/1847R (Supplementary Table S1atJXBonline). Cultures ofE. coliBL21 (600ml) harbouring pGEX_LjCCD7 or the empty vector in 2* YT medium (per litre: 16g of tryptone, 10g of yeast extract, and 5g of NaCl) were grown at 28 degrees C untilA600=0.5. Recombinant protein expression was induced by 0.2mM isopropyl-beta-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside at 18 degrees C for 24h. Escherichia colicells were harvested by centrifugation at 4 degrees C, resuspended in cold STE buffer (100mM NaCl, 10mM TRIS, 1mM EDTA, pH 8.0) containing 100 mug ml-1lysozyme, incubated on ice for 15min, and then lysed by sonication. The recombinant protein was purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare), visualized by 10% SDS-PAGE, and electrotransferred to a blotting membrane (Fluorotrans, Fluka). Western blot analysis was performed by blocking with 5% non-fat dehydrated milk in TBST buffer (10mM TRIS-HCl, 150mM NaCl, and 0.05% Tween-20), followed by incubation with polyclonal antibodies against GST and then against alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) diluted respectively at 1:5000 and 1:10 000 in TBST buffer with 0.5% milk. Extensive washing in TBST buffer was followed by nitroblue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate staining (Sigma). Forin vitroenzymatic assays, reactions were performed as previously reported (SchwartzNone., 2004;MarascoNone., 2006) with minor modifications. Soluble proteins were quantified with the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). Aliquots of the affinity-purified GST-LjCCD7 protein (50-100 mug in 100 mul of glutathione elution buffer) were brought to 400 mul with 100mM TRIS buffer, pH 7.0 containing 300mM NaCl, 0.5mM FeSO4, 10mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 5mM ascorbate, and 0.05% Triton X-100. After 20min of equilibration, 80 mul of substrate (0.5mM Type II beta-carotene in acetonitrile; presumably all-trans, Sigma C4582) were added. Note that even if 9-cis-beta-carotene is the real substrate of CCD7 (AlderNone., 2012),trans-beta-carotene can also be cleaved (though not as efficiently), and is the commercially available isomer. Reaction tubes were gently shaken in the dark at 28 degrees C for 5h before being quenched with 50 mul of 33% formaldehyde for 10min at 37 degrees C. A 600 mul aliquot of acetonitrile was added to each tube and the organic layer was saved for HPLC analysis. A Perkin Elmer series 200 HPLC system equipped with a diode array was used for detection. Separation was performed using a C18 reversed-phase column (250 mm*4.6mm internal diameter, 5 mum particles; YMC Europe) with the solvent system methanol:water (70:30, v/v) containing 0.1% ammonium acetate (B) and methanol (A) as described (MarascoNone., 2006). The transformation ofL. japonicusecotype Gifu B-129 was performed viaAgrobacterium tumefaciensstrain EHA105 harbouring pTKO2_LjCCD7 or pTKO2_pENTR (NC) as detailed previously (BarbulovaNone., 2005) with slight changes. Briefly, roots, shoots, and leaves were excised from 3-week-old seedlings grown in Petri dishes on Gamborg B5 (Sigma) and separately conditioned onto callus-inducing medium (CIM) (LombariNone., 2003) for an additional week. Segments were dipped for 25min intoA. tumefacienscultures grown toA600=0.4-0.6 at 28 degrees C in YEB medium (per litre: 5g of peptone, 5g of beef extract, 1g of yeast extract, 5g of sucrose, and 0.5g of MgCl2). The explants were then dried quickly on sterile filter paper and transferred onto fresh CIM plates. After 3 d of co-cultivation in the dark, bacterial slime was rinsed away in sterile water. Explants were dried on sterile filter paper and transferred on CIM plus 500mg l-1cefotaxime and 200mg l-1carbenicillin. After 2 d, transformed explants were selected on CIM plus 500mg l-1cefotaxime, 200mg l-1carbenicillin, and 100mg l-1kanamycin. After 3-4 weeks, the kanamycin-resistant sectors were transferred on shoot-inducing medium (SIM) (BarbulovaNone., 2005) containing 500mg l-1cefotaxime, 100mg l-1kanamycin, and 0.5mg l-1thidiazuron. After 2 weeks, calli from which rudimentary shoots were emerging were transferred on SIM plus 500mg l-1cefotaxime, 100mg l-1kanamycin, and 0.05mg l-1thidiazuron for shoot elongation. Regenerated T0plants with 1.5-2.0cm roots were transferred into pots filled with 2:1 perlite:Arabidopsisspecial soil (Horticoop) for seed setting. Their seeds (T1generation) were surface-sterilized (70% ethanol for 1min and 2.5% NaClO for 25min), stratified at 4 degrees C for 2-3 d on jellified Gamborg B5, then germinated at 24 degrees C in a growth chamber (16h light/8h dark). Then they were transferred in perlite-filled pots in a growth chamber (20-21 degrees C, 16h light/8h dark); 3-week-old seedlings from greater than 40 independent T0transgenic lines were screened by PCR with primer pairs KanF/KanR and RNAiR1/pTKO2-1847R (Supplementary Table S1atJXBonline) for the integration of the transgenic cassette. Among those with an SL-related phenotype, lines PG, P9, and P16 were selected for further studies because of their obvious shoot phenotype and homogeneous degree of target gene silencing and SL depletion. At the T0generation, these were hemizygous (as ascertained by PCR screening of the T1progeny obtained from self-pollination). Homozygous T1individuals were retained on the basis of progeny segregation analysis and propagated to T2and T3. All plants included in all experiments were tested for cassette integration andLjCCD7transcript levels in roots (if possible), and showed an obvious shoot phenotype. Seedlings of the wild type and RNA interference (RNAi) line P16 (unless otherwise stated) were used for metabolic (T1generation) and phenotypic analysis (T0, T1, T2, and/or T3generations, depending on the phenotypic character; for details, see the figure legends). Wild-type and/or transgenic NC plants were used interchangeably as controls, since no differences inLjCCD7expression, SL content, or general morphology were recorded. Surface-sterilized seeds were pre-conditioned on wet filter paper for 2 d, and then moved into a growth chamber (16h light/8h dark, 24 degrees C). Two-week-old seedlings were grown in 18cm diameter pots filled withArabidopsisspecial soil and perlite (1:2) in a greenhouse (16h light/8h dark, 20 degrees C), watered daily, and given 'Hornum' nutrients (Handberg and Stougaard, 1992) twice per week. Different traits were evaluated at different plant ages, as indicated in the Results. For all statistical analyses on shoot branching, only branches longer than 0.5cm were included. Root parameters (total length, area, and volume) were calculated by the WinRhizo software on digital images of whole apparatuses. For primary root length and stem width measurements, organs were photographed and analysed by ImageJ software. For chlorophyll quantification, two compound leaves, located at the same position on the main stem, were collected from three individual plants for each of the RNAi lines (PG, P9, and P16) and analysed as reported (NiNone., 2009). From the third round of seed setting until plants were 11 months old, flowers were counted on three plants for each of the three RNAi lines and NCs, and pods were harvested. The definitions used to describeLotusphyllotaxis are as inAlvarezNone. (2006). Two-week-old seedlings of transgenic line P16 and transgenic NC (15 each) were transplanted into an X-stream 20 aeroponic system (Nutriculture) and supplied with 5 litres of modified half-strength Hoagland solution (Hoagland and Arnon, 1950) refreshed twice a week. Experiments were performed 3-4 weeks later, when roots were fully developed but before the emergence of flowers. Root exudates were collected, purified, and concentrated as described previously (LiuNone., 2011). One day before exudate collection, roots were thoroughly rinsed with distilled water and the nutrient solution was refreshed to eliminate accumulated SLs. After exudate collection, roots from five plants for each sample were pooled and stored at -80 degrees C for later use. The experiment was repeated three times. SL extraction from root exudates and tissues was performed as previously reported (Lopez-RaezNone., 2010) with minor modifications. Exudates were firstly condensed into 50ml 60% acetone fractions eluted from a C18 column (GracePure 5000mg 20ml-1), of which 2ml fractions were used, and each mixed with 200 mul of 0.1 nmol ml-1[2H]6-5-deoxystrigol in acetone as internal standard for further purification. Once samples were well evaporated under a speed vacuum, the residues were dissolved in 50 mul of ethyl acetate and diluted with 4ml of hexane for silica column purification (GracePure 200mg 3ml-1). Elutions of 40% or 60% ethyl acetate in hexane were combined and dried. The residues were dissolved in 200 mul of acetonitrile:water (25:75), filtered, and used for ultraperformance liquid chromatography tandem spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) analysis. Fresh frozen root samples (0.5g each) were ground and extracted with 2ml of 0.05 nmol ml-1[2H]6-5-deoxystrigol, used as internal standard, in ethyl acetate. The samples were sonicated for 15min in a Branson 3510 ultrasonic bath (Branson Ultrasonics, USA). Samples were centrifuged for 15min at 2500g; the supernatant was gently transferred to 4ml glass vials, and the pellet was re-extracted with 2ml of ethyl acetate without internal standard. Supernatants were combined, and ethyl acetate evaporated under vacuum. The following steps were performed as described above in root exudate purification. A Xevo tandem mass spectrometer (Waters) equipped with an electrospray ionization (ESI) source and coupled to an Acquity UPLC system (Waters) was used for SL detection and identification as described (KohlenNone., 2012). Data were analysed with MassLynx 4.1 (Waters). Mesorhizobium lotistrain R7A was used for nodulation assays. Slightly lignified shoots were cut off 4-month-old plants (line P16), and set for root induction in rockwool. When roots were ~0.5-1.0cm long (1.5-2.0 weeks), plants were transferred to perlite for another week, and irrigated with B D nutrient solution (Broughton and Dilworth, 1971). Each plant was inoculated with 30ml of bacterial culture grown at 28 degrees C in YMB medium (per litre: 0.4g of yeast extract, 10.0g of mannitol, 5.0g of K2HPO4, 0.2g of MgSO4, 0.1g of NaCl, 0.5g of sucrose) and diluted to a finalA600of ~0.05. Nodules and lateral roots were counted 2 weeks post-inoculation. AMF colonization assessment was carried out on plants infected withGigaspora margaritaspores in 'Millipore sandwiches' (NoveroNone., 2002). Briefly, seeds sterilized with sulphuric acid were pre-germinated on 0.6% water agar. Roots were placed between two nitrocellulose membranes (5cm diameter, 0.45 mum pores; Millipore) with 20 fungal spores sterilized by chloramine T (3%) and streptomycin sulphate (0.3%). After 4 weeks of co-culture, roots were sampled and stained with cotton blue (0.1% in lactic acid) to visualize fungal structures. For each genotype, intraradical colonization was evaluated in three plants and at least 160cm of roots under an optical microscope (TrouvelotNone., 1986). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed on all data sets by using GenStat for Windows. If needed, data were also subjected to Student'st-test. MAX3 fromArabidopsisand RMS5 from pea were used to interrogate the EST and genomic database at the Kazusa DNA Research Institute. The EST aligning best to the queries (LjSGA_131670.1, 873bp) was assumed to derive from theirbona fide Lotusorthologue, designatedLjCCD7. Based on the partial coding sequence available, the missing cDNA ends ofLjCCD7were obtained by 5'- and 3'-RACE followed by direct amplification of the full-length coding sequence. The predicted polypeptide was 74% identical to RMS5 and 58% identical to MAX3. A phylogenetic tree (Supplementary Fig. S1atJXBonline) was produced from an alignment of several CCD7 homologues from land plants and moss, as well as of some putative homologues identified in cyanobacteria (CuiNone., 2012). The CCD7 proteins clustered into several clades, with LjCCD7 in the subclade of predicted leguminous homologues within the dicot clade, as expected (Supplementary Fig. S1atJXBonline). To verify whether the phylogenetic prediction corresponded to a conserved enzymatic function, the carotenoid cleavage activity of LjCCD7 was testedin vitro. To do so, recombinant GST-LjCCD7 was affinity purified fromE. colicells, and its apparent size (~98kDa) checked by SDS-PAGE and western blotting (Supplementary Fig. S2A, B atJXBonline). After 5h incubation in the presence of beta-carotene (C40) as substrate, two compounds were detected in the presence of GST-LjCCD7 and not with GST alone. One of them had a visible spectrum peak and retention time similar to beta-ionone (C13;Supplementary Fig. S2C). The second was deduced to be 10'-apo-beta-carotenal (Supplementary Fig. S2D); that is, the complementary C27that would result from the cleavage of the 9', 10'-bond of beta-carotene by CCD7. These results agreed with previous work inArabidopsisand tomato (BookerNone., 2004;SchwartzNone., 2004;VogelNone., 2010) and proved that the cloned cDNA corresponds to a protein endowed with carotenoid cleavage activityin vitro. With the outcome of phylogenetic analysis shown inSupplementary Fig. S1, they support the notion that the identified gene encodes theL. japonicusCCD7 orthologue. To study the expression pattern ofLjCCD7, RT-qPCR was performed on RNA samples from a range of vegetative tissues from 8-week-old wild-type plants. As inArabidopsis(BookerNone., 2004), pea (JohnsonNone., 2006), petunia (DrummondNone., 2009), and tomato (VogelNone., 2010),LjCCD7was predominantly expressed in roots, ~2-fold more than in leaves and the shoot apex. LjCCD7transcript was also detected in stipules, although 13 times less abundantly than in roots (Fig. 1A). LjCCD7transcription pattern, and molecular and metabolic characterization ofCCD7-silenced lines. (A)LjCCD7transcript abundance in various vegetative tissues relative to root expression level in 8-week-old wild-typeL. japonicus. Values are the average ofnbiological and three technical replicates +/-SE, normalized toLjUBItranscript levels. n=6 for root and shoot apex,n=5 for expanded or developing leaf,n=4 for stipule. (B) RelativeLjCCD7transcript amounts in roots of RNAi lines PG, P9, and P16 (grey bars), compared with a line transformed with the empty vector (negative control, NC; black bar). Values are normalized toLjUBItranscript amounts, and displayed as means ofnbiological and three technical replicates +/-SE (n=3 for each RNAi line and n=5 for controls, all at the T1generation). The asterisks indicate statistically significant differences forP less than 0.01. (C) LC-MS/MS analysis of 5-deoxystrigol content in root exudates and extracts of 6/7-week-old, aeroponically grown plants of the wild type (black bars) and of theCCD7-knockdown line P16 at generation T1(grey bars). Twenty-four hours before collection of root exudates, the nutrient solution was refreshed for 15 plants. In root extracts, three independent samples were used and each consisted of five plants. Error bars represent the SE for three analytical replicates. The asterisks indicate a statistically significant difference forP less than 0.01. To elucidate the biological function ofLjCCD7 in planta, greater than 40 independent RNAi lines were generated. Three of them (PG, P9, and P16) displayed ~70% lessLjCCD7transcript in roots relative to corresponding transgenic control plants (Fig. 1B), and were selected for further analysis. CCD7is a key biosynthetic gene for SLs, so the presence of all known SLs in the root exudates and extracts of wild-typeLotuswas initially checked (not shown); 5-deoxystrigol was the only one detected, in accordance with previous work (Sugimoto and Ueyama, 2008). 5-Deoxystrigol was therefore quantified in both root exudates and extracts of wild-typeL. japonicusand transgenic seedlings (line P16). In all samples, one distinct peak was detected that had the retention time and transitions corresponding to 5-deoxystrigol. 5-Deoxystrigol levels were higher in root exudates than in root extracts, both in wild-type seedlings and in theCCD7-silenced line. Metabolite abundance in RNAi plants was decreased by 81% and 73% in root exudates and extracts, respectively, relative to the non-silenced control seedlings (Fig. 1C). Since SLs regulate plant architecture, experiments were conducted to assess whether the reduction inLjCCD7transcript and SL content was associated with altered morphology in RNAi line P16; lines P9 and PG, in whichLjCCD7was silenced comparably, were also evaluated. From 3 weeks after germination, the RNAi lines exhibited a clearly stunted and bushy phenotype (Fig. 2A). Shoot branches were counted at two time points. Eight-week-old transgenic plants were significantly more branched than controls transformed with the empty vector: RNAi lines displayed 5.3, 2.1, and 4.0 times more cotyledonary, primary, and secondary aerial branches, respectively (Fig. 2B). When 6 months old, plants of the PG, P9, and P16 lines displayed 6.4, 6.6, and 5.7 times more total shoot branches relative to the controls, respectively (Fig. 2C). No branches of secondary or higher order occurred in the transgenic control plants at this or later stages, in contrast to RNAi lines (Supplementary Fig. S3A, B atJXBonline). RNAi plants also had a significantly reduced main stem height (39, 40, and 29% shorter than the transgenic NC line, respectively;Fig. 3A). Reduced plant height was not due to a reduced number of nodes in the RNAi lines (not shown). Rather, internodes were significantly shorter in silenced plants compared with the corresponding control, particularly in high-order nodes. In fact, internodes IV-VII of the main stems were ~30-40% shorter in line P16 than in the wild type (Fig. 3B). The same was observed for most internodes above node III in secondary shoot branches (Fig. 3C). SLs have been shown to control the thickening of stems and roots (AgustiNone., 2011). As expected, RNAi line P16 displayed an ~39% reduction of secondary shoot diameter compared with the control (Fig. 3D,E). Shoot architecture analysis of RNAi lines. (A) Representative comparison of shoot branching appearance of RNAi line P16 and negative controls (NCs) transformed with the empty vector, both 10 weeks old and at the T1generation. (B) Cotyledonary, primary, and secondary aerial branches of 8-week-old RNAi plants from lines PG, P9, and P16 (grey bars) and the NC (black bars). Each value represents the mean +/-SD (n=4 andn=3 T1plants for control and each RNAi genotype, respectively). The asterisks indicate statistically significant differences for *P less than 0.05 and **P less than 0.01. (C) Total shoot branches of 6-month-old T1RNAi lines PG, P9, and P16 (grey bars) and the NC (black bar). Each value represents the mean +/-SD (n=14 for control versusn=3 for each RNAi line). The asterisks indicate statistically significant differences forP less than 0.01. (This figure is available in colour atJXBonline.) Shoot morphology of SL-depleted versus control plants. (A) Plant height of 6-month-old T1transgenic negative control (NC, black bar) and RNAi lines PG, P9, and P16 (grey bars). Error bars represent the SD of the means (n= 10 andn=3 for NC and each RNAi line, respectively). Asterisks indicate statistically significant differences between each RNAi line and the NC, forP less than 0.01. (B and C) Comparison of internode length between 2.5-month-old wild-type plants (black bars) and RNAi line P16, T1generation (grey bars). The internode above the cotyledons was set as the first node in the acropetal direction, so internode I lies between collar and cotyledonary node I, and so forth.

SLs affect root development, including lateral root formation, and primary root and root hair development (Koltai, 2011;Ruyter-SpiraNone., 2011). To assess the function of SLs inLotusroot development, plants of RNAi line P16 were grown either in aeroponic tanks or in pots. Under all conditions, the RNAi line consistently showed more lateral roots and longer primary roots (Fig. 4A). Five-week-old plants grown in aeroponic tanks were used for quantitative analysis: RNAi plants had a 1.6-2.0 times higher total root length, area, and volume than controls (Fig. 4B,C). Notably, the primary root of the RNAi line was significantly longer than in the corresponding controls grown either in the aeroponic system or in pots.

Lotus japonicusecotype 'Gifu' flowers profusely and, in subsequent rounds, yields thousands of seeds within months after pollination (Handberg and Stougaard, 1992). We observed that seed production was severely impaired in RNAi plants compared with controls, particularly after two rounds of seed settings (representative individuals are shown inSupplementary Fig. S4AatJXBonline). For a statistical assessment, all flowers from the third round on were counted and pods were harvested separately. An at least 7-fold reduction of flower and pod numbers was observed in RNAi lines relative to the NC (Fig. 5). After the above-ground part of 11-month-old plants was lopped off, ~40 times fewer pods were counted on the emergent branches of RNAi plants than on controls (not shown). Impairment of flower and seed setting was less severe for line P16 than lines PG and P9, which is why the first was used for most analyses. There were no significant changes with respect to size, shape, or colour of the flowers, pods, and seeds. Given the intimate cross-talk occurring between SLs and auxin during reproductive development (KohlenNone., 2012), the levels of free indole acetic acid (IAA) were measured in flowers collected at anthesis. Only a mild but statistically non-significant reduction was observed in RNAi line P16 compared with controls (Supplementary Fig. S4BatJXBonline). LjCCD7transcript correlates with flower and pod number.

Values are means +/-SD (n=3 independent plants per genotype). The asterisks indicate statistically significant differences forP less than 0.01. Lotusis a deciduous perennial displaying progressive leaf senescence and abscission in temperate climates. Since a role for SLs in senescence had been proposed (SnowdenNone., 2005;LedgerNone., 2010), the leaves of the transgenic plants were monitored for any obvious colour change compared with control, and chlorophyll in leaves of comparable physiological age was quantified. All three RNAi lines remained green for a longer time than the control (seeSupplementary Fig. S5AatJXBonline) and accumulated significantly more chlorophylla(Chla) and Chlbthan the NC, with a cumulative 2-fold increase in total chlorophyll content when ~8 months old (Fig. 6A). At a younger stage (~3 months old), RNAi lines PG and P9 showed a significant increase in Chlaand Chlb, respectively; however, total chlorophyll content was not significantly different from that of the NC (Fig. 6A). When the top and internal part of 8-month-old RNAi plants left to senesce spontaneously had slightly started to fade in colour, controls were already severely senescing throughout their aerial parts (Supplementary Fig. S5BatJXBonline). Also, more new shoots and branches kept emerging in RNAi lines compared with NCls (Supplementary Fig. S3CatJXBonline). Finally, the RNAi line had higher biomass relative to control plants when ~3.5 months old (Fig. 6B); the trend was maintained with plant ageing. However, the shoot-to-root ratio was largely unchanged (average ratio +/-SD: 2.796+/-0.204 for RNAi lines versus 2.591+/-0.094 for controls; data inFig. 6B). LjCCD7influences age-related senescence progression and biomass inLotus.

Values are means +/-SD (n=8 for each RNAi line andn=7 for NC). The asterisks indicate significant differences of Chlaand Chlbbetween RNAi plants and NCs of the same age for *P less than 0.05 and **P less than 0.01. (B) Fresh weight of roots and aerial parts in 3.5-month-old wild-type plants (black bars) compared with RNAi line P16, T1generation (grey bars). Values are means +/-SD (n greater than = 6). The asterisks indicate statistically significant differences for *P less than 0.05 and **P less than 0.01. The influence of SLs onLotusdeterminate root nodules was explored. There were no significant differences in root fresh weight of RNAi plants compared with the wild-type and NC plants (not shown). However, their adventitious roots were significantly more branched also in the specific culture conditions used for this test (Fig. 7A,B). Although this situation potentially offers a larger surface to rhizobial infection for the same root biomass, RNAi roots carried significantly fewer nodules per gram of fresh weight than the NC 2 weeks post-inoculation (~20% reduction;Fig. 7C). In contrast, when controls and RNAi lines P16 and P9 were inoculated with spores of the AMFG. margarita, no significant differences in the colonization parameters evaluated were detected (Fig. 7D). SL-depleted roots supported both extra- and intraradical mycelium, which did not differ in quantity and developmental pattern from control roots. Also, arbuscules were morphologically indistinguishable (not shown). SL-depletedLotusplants nodulate less than controls but are not affected in AM symbiosis.

(D) Results of mycorrhization tests on controls (wild-type and NC plants, black bars) and RNAi lines P9 and P16, T2generation (grey bars).

(This figure is available in colour atJXBonline.) The phenotype of the SL-depletedL. japonicusplants characterized in this study was overall expected, on the basis of previously published work. RNAi plants were in fact stunted and their shoots more branched than controls, as were root apparatuses. More adventitious roots (not shown) were also observed, consistent with published data onArabidopsisand pea (RasmussenNone., 2012). Notwithstanding, the shoot morphology ofL. japonicusis quite different from that of other model plant species, which makes it an attractive model to study SL function. In fact, in wild-typeLotus, the axillary buds in the cotyledonary node or in the leaf axils are already visible during the early vegetative stage. Once these buds are initiated, they develop directly into lateral branches without being inhibited by any factors released by the shoot apical meristems. Thereafter, numerous accessory meristems will potentially develop lateral branches in the cotyledonary node zone, but in the aerial part only a single bud in the leaf axis develops into a branch while the others remain dormant (AlvarezNone., 2006). This peculiar developmental pattern was reflected in some specific shoot features in the SL-depleted plants. In contrast to most SL-related phenotypes described so far, in fact, branching of secondary shoots was highly increased compared with controls. This phenotype has been reported, though to a milder extent, only inCCD7- andCCD8-silenced tomato plants (VogelNone., 2010;KohlenNone., 2012). In transgenic Lotus, this increase was most probably due to several of the accessory buds in the aerial axils developing into lateral shoots, in contrast to what happens in the wild type (AlvarezNone., 2006). Also, many more basal branches than in the wild type were produced from the activity of accessory buds in the cotyledonary axil, resulting in more numerous primary shoots (Supplementary Fig. S3CatJXBonline). Primary and secondary shoots were shorter inCCD7-silenced plants compared with control plants because of a reduced internode length (as in petunia and maize) (SnowdenNone., 2005;GuanNone., 2012) rather than number (as in tomato) (KohlenNone., 2012). LjCCD7-silenced plants differed slightly but significantly from other published SL mutants at the root level as well, in that they consistently exhibited longer primary roots than the controls. Results inArabidopsis, rice, and maize point instead to a role for SLs in the promotion of primary root growth (KoltaiNone., 2010None;Ruyter-SpiraNone., 2011;AriteNone., 2012;GuanNone., 2012). In these species, SLs were proposed to alter the auxin gradient in the root tips, thus changing both the number and length of the cells located in the meristem and transition zone of primary roots. The results suggest that the role of SLs in primary root development differs from species to species, possibly in relation to varying endogenous hormonal levels. Finally, the above- and below-ground mass of SL-depleted plants was increased, so that the shoot-to-root biomass ratio was comparable with that of controls. This observation differs from what has been reported for the petuniaccd7/dad3mutant, which displays a higher shoot-to-root ratio than the wild type (SnowdenNone., 2005). This discrepancy may be due to the different species, growth conditions (hydroponic for petunia), and/or physiological age of the plants. A role for SLs was postulated in reproduction, considering the high expression ofArabidopsis MAX3in siliques and seeds (BookerNone., 2004;MashiguchiNone., 2009), of tomatoSlCCD7in green immature fruits (VogelNone., 2010), ofAcCCD7andAcCCD8in young kiwifruits and seeds (LedgerNone., 2010), and ofZmCCD8in maize shank and ear shoots of female inflorescences (GuanNone., 2012). To date, however, CCD7 activity has never been proven to affect reproduction, and, more specifically, the reduced flower, fruit, and seed numbers observed inL. japonicushave never been reported for SL-depleted plants of any species. Rather, the petuniadad1/ccd8mutant is delayed in the setting of flowers, which also weigh less and are smaller than those of the wild type (SnowdenNone., 2005). SlCCD8-silenced tomato plants also have smaller floral organs, fruits, and seeds, as well as 60% fewer seeds relative to controls (KohlenNone., 2012). Also a significant reduction in the size and diameter of ear and shank was observed in maizeZmCCD8mutants (GuanNone., 2012). In contrast, abnormal floral organs, altered size and colour of flowers, pods, and seeds, or seed patterning inside the pod were not observed in transgenic Lotus consistent with the fact that no significant differences in free IAA content could be detected in flowers of RNAi and wild-type plants. Therefore, it is proposed that the observed reduction in seed production in transgenic plants is mainly due to the reduced number of flowers. To form its pseudoraceme inflorescences, the shoot main apex ofL. japonicusproduces a flower branch, which is subtended in the compound leaves and is terminated when one or two flowers are developed (GuoNone., 2006). A possible explanation for the reduced number of flowers in RNAi compared with transgenic control plants, in spite of their higher number of branches, is that their potential to form new buds that can produce flower branches may be reduced compared with controls. This, in turn, could be linked to the fact that the dormancy of many accessory buds was broken to give higher order branches, before transition from vegetative growth to flowering. Alternatively, or additionally, fewer resources could be available to reproduction in the SL-depleted plants because of the more vigorous vegetative growth (see below). LjCCD7-silencedLotuslines lagged in leaf senescence and abscission; this the first report linking senescence to a functional defect in aCCD7homologue. A correlation between SLs and senescence was instead reported inArabidopsis, rice, and petunia plants lackingMAX2(WooNone., 2001;YanNone., 2007;DrummondNone., 2012), and in theccd8mutants of petunia and kiwifruit (SnowdenNone., 2005;LedgerNone., 2010). Transcripts of theArabidopsis MAX3/CCD7andMAX4/CCD8genes accumulate during age-dependent leaf senescence, further suggesting that the role of SLs in the process may be direct (BreezeNone., 2011). However, mutation of theMAX2orthologue in pea (RMS4) does not affect leaf senescence (JohnsonNone., 2006), implying that this is not a conserved feature of SLs across plant species. A link may be seen between the delayed leaf senescence and impaired flower and seed production in the RNAi plants used here. Reproductive development controls the timing of leaf senescence, with photosynthates translocated from leaves to reproductive organs before death. The negative correlation between senescence and reproduction could be even more evident in polycarpic plants such asL. japonicus, which sets numerous inflorescences in subsequent rounds. The iterative production of reproductive organs and seeds may require more resources at the expense of vegetative fitness (Munne-Bosch, 2008). In this scenario,LjCCD7-silenced plants would allocate fewer resources than control plants to reproduction, thus delaying senescence and allowing higher biomass. This interpretation agrees with the observation that chlorophyll content was higher in the leaves of the RNAi lines used here compared with control plants, particularly at and after reproduction. It also agrees with the fact that total biomass was higher in RNAi plants than in controls. Whether the higher resource allocation to vegetative growth is the cause of the observed impairment of reproduction, or rather its effect, cannot be determined at this stage. The present data prove for the first time that SLs promote the formation of determinate nodules. The correlation between SLs and nodulation was previously investigated inM. sativaand pea, both forming indeterminate nodules (SotoNone., 2010;Foo and Davies, 2011;FooNone., 2013). InL. japonicusas well,LjCCD7-silenced plants carried 20% fewer nodules than controls. As in the pearms1mutant, alterations in nodule development and morphology were not detected. SLs apparently have no direct influence on the growth of rhizobia, but they do have a quantitative effect on nodulation, in spite of their negative effect on the total root length and surface available to infection (Foo and Davies, 2011). Even if nodules and lateral roots form from different founder cells (being initiated by cortical versus pericycle cell divisions, respectively), a balance was proposed long ago to exist between nodule and lateral root formation, with nodule primordia initiation dependent on the suppression of lateral root emergence (Nutman, 1949). Later, it was proposed that the balance of auxin, cytokinins, and abscisic acid (ABA) decides the fate of pericycle cells and cortical cells, dictating whether lateral roots or nodules will be initiated (Ding and Oldroyd, 2009). Given the proven cross-talk of SLs with auxin (CrawfordNone., 2010;Domagalska and Leyser, 2011;Ruyter-SpiraNone., 2011;KohlenNone., 2012) and ABA (LechatNone., 2012;TohNone., 2012), and the importance of both these hormones for normal frequency and development of determinate nodules inLotus(Ding and Oldroyd, 2009), the phenotype observed in the SL-depleted plants could be auxin and/or ABA mediated, and be the outcome of an obviously defective suppression mechanism on lateral root emergence. As proven for 5-deoxystrigol in root exudates ofL. japonicusin the first place, SLs induce hyphal branching of AMF, increasing the chances of successful root colonization (AkiyamaNone., 2005). AMAX2/D3-dependent,D14-independent effect on AMF colonization of roots was also observed very recently in rice (YoshidaNone., 2012). In anSlCCD8-knockdown line of tomato, ~50% reduction of total SLs in roots correlated with a 27% decrease in colonization byGlomus intraradices(KohlenNone., 2012). Interestingly, the RNAi lines used in the present study did not show a significant reduction in AMF colonization for any of the parameters tested. Among all natural and synthetic SLs, 5-deoxystrigol (the only SL found inLotus) is the most active, inducing AMF branching at subnanogram concentrations (AkiyamaNone., 2010;XieNone., 2010). Therefore, it is possible that the residual 20-30% of 5-deoxystrigol in the RNAi lines used here is still above the required threshold to induce fairly normal hyphal branching ofG. margaritain our inoculation system (clean roots placed in close contact with germinating AMF spores). Very recently, protocols enabling highly efficient insertion mutagenesis were set up forLotus(FukaiNone., 2012;UrbanskiNone., 2012). The availability of such reverse genetic tools, through which complete knockout of genes would be achievable, will allow this point to be solved. In summary, this is the first report of an SL-related phenotype in the perennial herbaceous modelL. japonicus. Evidence was presented thatLjCCD7is crucial for SL synthesis inLotus, where the role of SLs is conserved in the regulation of root and shoot architecture, with some peculiarities; among them, the effects on primary root growth, internode length, number of higher order branches, and root-to-shoot biomass ratio. These apparent discrepancies are most probably specific features of SL action in the model plant used here, and, thus, just the reflection of biological diversity. Additional effects on reproduction and senescence were for the first time linked to an impairment in the expression of a CCD7 enzyme, and an effect of SLs on determinate nodulation was described. Further work is under way to unravel cross-talk of SLs with other hormones and their relative contributions to the observed phenotypes. Supplementary data are available atJXBonline. Figure S1.
