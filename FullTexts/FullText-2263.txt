Type 1 diabetes is a consequence of autoimmune destruction of beta-cells, involving activation of cellular immunity leading to infiltration of islets by inflammatory immune cells (1,2). An understudied area is the role lipid signals play in this process. Our studies indicate that the group VIA Ca2+-independent phospholipase A2beta (iPLA2beta) is induced under a diabetic milieu and that mitigation of iPLA2beta attenuates beta-cell death (3-6). These findings raise the possibility that iPLA2beta contributes to beta-cell death and consequential diabetes development. The iPLA2beta enzyme is a member of the family of PLA2s (7) that catalyzes hydrolysis of thesn-2 substituent from glycerophospholipid substrates to yield a free fatty acid and a 2-lysophospholipid (8), is widely expressed, and participates in numerous biological processes (9). In the islet, iPLA2beta is predominantly localized in beta-cells (4,10), which are enriched in arachidonate-containing phospholipid substrates. Following its hydrolysis by iPLA2beta, arachidonic acid can be metabolized by cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX) to bioactive eicosanoids, many of which are recognized promoters of immune responses (11,12). In view of a described link between iPLA2beta and beta-cell apoptosis and evidence of its induction in clinical and experimental diabetes (13-15), we considered the possibility that iPLA2beta inhibition preserves beta-cell mass and mitigates diabetes development. To date, theS-enantiomer of bromoenol lactone (S-BEL), with 10 times greater specificity for iPLA2beta than iPLA2gamma (16), has been used to discern the role of iPLA2beta in biological processes. However, several features of BEL, including irreversible inhibition of iPLA2s, nonspecific inhibition of serine-based non-iPLA2enzymes, and cytotoxicity (9,17), render it less feasible for use as an in vivo inhibitor of iPLA2beta. Fluoroketone (FK) compounds have been synthesized that exhibit selectivity for iPLA2s versus sPLA2s or cPLA2s (18). We demonstrated that FKGK18 is a reversible inhibitor that is 100-fold more specific for iPLA2beta than iPLA2gamma, does not nonspecifically inhibit other serine proteases, is not cytotoxic, and inhibits beta-cell apoptosis (19). These observations suggest that FKGK18 is amenable for in vivo administrations and led us to assess its impact on autoimmune diabetes development. The potential for beneficial effects of inhibiting iPLA2beta in vivo with FK compounds is evidenced by amelioration of ovarian cancer and central nervous system-related disorders, in the absence of systemic toxicity, with an earlier generation FKGK inhibitor (20-23). We report here that FKGK18 administration to spontaneous diabetes-prone NOD mice decreases diabetes incidence, reduces islet infiltration, improves glucose homeostasis, and preserves beta-cell area. Furthermore, FKGK18 inhibits immune cell function and adoptive transfer of diabetes. These findings suggest that iPLA2beta activation promotes immune responses and that iPLA2beta inhibition may be beneficial in ameliorating diabetes. Islet RNA was prepared from 6-7-week-old female C57BL/6J, NOD, NOD. scid, and NOD. Ragmice and male NOD mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME), and cDNA was prepared for quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) analyses as previously described (3). Primers were based on mouse sequences for iPLA2beta and internal control 18S (gene IDs 53357 and 19791, respectively). Female NOD mice were generated and maintained according to University of Alabama at Birmingham Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee policies. Mice were administered intraperitoneally three times per week vehicle (PBS + 5% Tween 80) or FKGK18 [20 mg/kg body weight (20)] from 10 days until euthanized. Body weights and blood glucose levels, measured from tail vein blood samples (2 muL) with the Breeze 2 Blood Glucose Monitoring System (Bayer Healthcare, Mishawaka, IN), were recorded weekly. Diabetes incidence was based on two consecutive blood glucose readings greater than =15.3 mmol/L, at which time the mouse was euthanized. By 30 weeks, all mice were euthanized, and blood was collected in BD Microtainer Tubes with serum separator for insulin measurements (ELISA Kit; Mercodia, Uppsala, Sweden). Paraffin sections (10 mum) of pancreas, heart, liver, and kidney were stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H-E) for histological assessment. Islet images were captured, and total islet and noninfiltrated areas (pixels) were determined. Submandibular vein blood from mice was obtained between 0 and 72 h following FKGK18 administration. To 100 muL of serum sample, 1 mL of chloroform and 50 muL of 1 mol/L aqueous hydrochloric acid were added and the mixture vortexed for 30 s, centrifuged for 5 min, and the organic layer transferred to a clean tube. The remaining aqueous layer was re-extracted with 1 mL of chloroform by the same procedure. The two organic layers were combined, dried, reconstituted in methanol, and analyzed for FKGK18 by high-resolution mass spectrometry, recorded with a quadrupole time-of-flight Bruker maXis impact instrument using negative ion mode electrospray ionization protocol. Data acquisition was carried out with Bruker Daltonics DataAnalysis 4.1. Prostaglandin E2(PGE2) metabolite levels in urine, collected from individual mice housed in metabolic cages over an 18-h period in the absence of food but free access to water, were determined by enzyme immunosorbent assay (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) and normalized to urine creatinine levels measured by colorimetric assay (Cell Biolabs, Inc., San Diego, CA). At 25 weeks of age, overnight-fasted mice were administered glucose 2 g/kg body weight in filter-sterilized dH2O i.p., and tail vein blood samples (2 muL) were collected over a 2-h period for glucose measurement. The mice had free access to water during this time. Paraffin sections (10 mum) of pancreata were processed for immunostaining using an antigen retrieval protocol as previously described (24,25). Sections were incubated overnight at 4 degrees C with 1 degrees antibodies guinea pig anti-insulin (1:200) (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), rat anti-CD4 (1:50) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), rat anti-CD8alpha (1:50) (Santa Cruz), or rabbit anti-B220 (1:100) (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and subsequently with fluorescence-labeled 2 degrees antibodies Texas Red and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibodies (1:200) (Santa Cruz and Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) in the dark (2 h, room temperature). Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 2 mug/mL for 10 min, and the ratio of total insulin-stained islet region to H-E-stained pancreas section was used to calculate beta-cell area. Single-cell splenocyte suspensions were prepared from 8-12-week-old NOD mice. CD4+T cells were purified using the BD IMag CD4 T Lymphocyte Enrichment Set - DM (BD Biosciences), and resting B cells were purified using BD IMag B Lymphocyte Enrichment Set - DM (BD Biosciences), per manufacturer's instructions. CD4+T cells (2.5 * 105/well) were seeded in 96-well plates coated with alphaCD3 (1 mug/mL) (BioLegend, San Diego, CA) with media containing alphaCD28 (0.5 mug/mL) (BioLegend). Cytokine concentrations (48 and 72 h) in the supernatant were measured by ELISA (interleukin [IL]-2 and interferon-gamma [IFN-gamma] [BD Biosciences] and TNF-alpha [R D Systems, Minneapolis, MN]) as previously described (26). B cells (2.5 * 105/well) were seeded in 96-well plates for 72 h with media containing 1 mug/mL lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Life Technologies) and 2 ng/mL IL-4 (R D Systems) as previously described (27). IgG and IgM antibody production were measured in the supernatant from the B cells by ELISA (SouthernBiotech, Birmingham, AL) as previously described (28). Immune cells were incubated for 3.5 h at 37 degrees C in wells with 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) (Sigma-Aldrich, 20 muL of 5 mg/mL solution). Media were carefully aspirated and replaced with an equal volume of MTT solvent (4 mmol/L HCl and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 in isopropanol). The plate was agitated on a shaker in the dark for 15 min, and absorbance was read at 590 nm. Single-cell splenocyte suspensions were prepared from 12-week-old male BDC2.5/NOD mice, as previously described (29). CD4+T cells were purified, activated in six-well plates (5 * 106cells/well) coated with alphaCD3 and alphaCD28 (1 mug/mL each), and expanded with media containing 100 U/mL IL-2 for 72 h. They were further expanded into T-75 flasks (5 * 106cells/flask) with media containing 100 U/mL IL-2 for 72 h, collected, washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS), and diluted to 5 * 106cells/mL in HBSS. Recipient 6-week-old immunodeficient male NOD. scidmice were divided into control and T cells +/- FKGK18-administered groups, and diabetes incidence was monitored for 14 days. Pancreas section and islet images were captured on an Olympus IX81 microscope using cellSens Dimension software and analyzed using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). Data were converted to mean +/- SEM and Studentttest was applied to determine significant differences between two groups (P less than 0.05). Incidence of diabetes was plotted as a survival curve and analyzed by Mantel-Cox test. RT-qPCR analyses revealed three- to fivefold higher iPLA2beta mRNA in islets from 6- to 7-week-old spontaneous diabetes-prone female NOD mice relative to age-matched diabetes-resistant female C57BL/6J, NOD. scid, and NOD. Ragand male NOD mice (Fig. 1None). Because NOD mice exhibit insulitis by 4-6 weeks of age and develop spontaneous diabetes by 10-20 weeks of age (30), these findings raise the possibility that an early increase in iPLA2beta contributes to diabetes development. iPLA2beta expression, FKGK18 administration, and in vivo evidence for iPLA2beta inhibition in NOD mice. A: RT-qPCR analyses of iPLA2beta was performed using cDNA generated from total RNA prepared from islets isolated from female C57BL/6J, NOD, NOD. scid, and NOD. Ragmice and male NOD mice (6-7 weeks of age). Fold changes relative to NOD. scidare presented as mean +/- SEM. *P less than 0.05 vs. NOD. scid/NOD. Rag; #P less than 0.0001 vs. C57BL/6J and NOD male (n= 3 pools of 5-8 mice each). B: Experimental protocol. CandD: High-resolution mass spectrometry analyses of FKGK18 standard (0.50 mug/mL). Total ion spectrum showing the parent ion at m/z 279.1002 (C) and ESI/MS/MSNonespectrum showing signature daughter ions at m/z 209.0970 and 68.9945 (D). E: ESI/MS/MS spectrum of FKGK18 in serum from NOD mice 6 h postadministration (20 mg/kg i.p.). F: PGEM assay. Mice under treatment for 10 weeks were housed individually in metabolic cages, and urine was collected overnight (18 h), starting immediately (0-18 h), 24 h (24-42 h), and 48 h (48-66 h) after last administration of vehicle or FKGK18. PGEM measured by enzyme immunosorbent assay and normalized to urine creatinine is presented as mean +/- SEM of PGEM relative to vehicle treatment. *P less than 0.05 vs. corresponding vehicle group (n= 6 per group). Intens., intensity; IPGTT, intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test; PBS-T, PBS + 5% Tween 80; Rel., relative. Female NOD mice were administered vehicle or FKGK18 starting at 10 days of age (Fig. 1None), and FKGK18 bioavailability was determined by high-resolution mass spectrometry. Standard FKGK18 (molecular weight 280 g/mol) generated a predominant parent [M-H]-ion at charge/mass ratio (m/z) 279 (Fig. 1None) and electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI/MS/MS) analyses revealed signature ions at m/z 209.0970, arising from the loss of CHF3[M-H-CHF3]-, and m/z 68.9945, representing [CHF3-H]-, from the parent ion (Fig. 1None). Analyses of NOD serum from mice treated with FKGK18 for greater than 15 weeks generated a similar spectrum profile (Fig. 1None) and revealed maximum levels of FKGK18 between 2 and 6 h (?300 ng/mL), which decreased to 70-280 ng/mL by 20-24 h, 0-30 ng/mL by 44-48 h, and were undetectable by 72 h after the last injection. Because the reversible nature of FKGK18 precludes in vivo iPLA2beta activity measurement, urinary 13,14-dihydro-15-keto metabolite of PGE2(PGEM) levels were measured and found to be decreased up to 42 h but returned to vehicle levels between 48 and 66 h (Fig. 1None). Taken together, it was deduced that the in vivo inhibitory effects of FKGK18 20 mg/kg i.p. persist for nearly 48 h.The FKGK18 regimen did not affect body weight (Fig. 2None) or promote discernible tissue damage (Fig. 2None) compared with vehicle. However, diabetes incidence was significantly reduced with FKGK18 (Fig. 2None). Consistent with literature reports of an ?80% incidence in female NOD mice (30), seven of nine (78%) vehicle-treated mice became diabetic by 25 weeks. In contrast, only 1 of 11 FKGK18-treated mice became diabetic by 25 weeks. At this age, five mice in each group were euthanized for further analyses. Among the remaining six in the FKGK18 group, one additional mouse became diabetic at 28 weeks. The lower diabetes incidence in the FKGK18 group was associated with twofold higher circulating insulin compared with the vehicle group (Fig. 2None). Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance testing revealed that although basal overnight-fasted blood glucose levels were similar in the vehicle and FKGK18 groups, they remained lower in the FKGK18 group over the test period (Fig. 2None). This was reflected by a 31% reduction in the area under curve of the FKGK18 group (Fig. 2None), indicating better glucose homeostasis relative to the vehicle group. Body weight, tissue histology, diabetes incidence, and glucose tolerance testing. Female NOD mice were injected intraperitoneally with vehicle (PBS + 5% Tween 80 [PBS-T]) or FKGK18 (20 mg/kg, three times per week) from 10 days until euthanasia. A: Body weights. Weekly recordings in vehicle (n= 9) and FKGK18 (n= 11) groups. B: Tissue histology. At euthanasia, heart, liver, and kidney were excised and processed for H-E staining. Representative images (three random fields captured per mouse) are shown. Original magnification *400, scale bar = 50 mum. C: Diabetes incidence. Blood glucose was monitored weekly, and onset of diabetes was recorded in vehicle-treated and FKGK18-treated mice when two consecutive readings greater than =15.3 mmol/L were obtained. *P= 0.015, FKGK18 group vs. vehicle group, Mantel-Cox test (n= 9-11 per group). D: Serum insulin. At euthanasia, blood was collected, and serum levels of insulin were determined by ELISA. Data are mean +/- SEM. *P less than 0.05, FKGK18 group vs. vehicle group (n= 7-10). E: Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance testing (IPGTT). Mice treated with vehicle or FKGK18 for 25 weeks were fasted overnight before obtaining basal blood glucose levels. The mice were then administered glucose 2 g/kg body weight, and blood glucose in a 2-muL aliquot of tail vein blood was monitored over a 2-h period. *P less than 0.05, FKGK18 group vs. vehicle group. F: Area under the curve. Data obtained through the IPGTT were used to calculate the area under the curve, an index of glucose tolerance. *P less than 0.05, FKGK18 group vs. vehicle group. Arb., arbitrary. As expected, significant infiltration was evident in islets from the vehicle group (Fig. 3None, left panels). In contrast, insulitis was markedly reduced in the FKGK18 group and when present, was predominantly in the peri-islet region (Fig. 3None, right panels). Percent islet infiltration, determined by measuring total islet and noninfiltrated areas, revealed 54% infiltration of islets in the vehicle group (128 from 9 mice) but only 35% infiltration of islets in the FKGK18 group (195 from 11 mice) (Fig. 3None). Breakdown of the infiltration spectrum (none to complete [0-100%]) revealed twice as many infiltrate-free islets and one-half as many islets with 75-100% infiltration in the FKGK18 group compared with the vehicle group (Fig. 3None). Consistent with the improved islet integrity, insulin staining area (Fig. 3None) relative to total pancreas section area was sevenfold greater (Fig. 3None) in the FKGK18 group, suggesting greater preservation of residual beta-cell mass relative to the vehicle group. Islet infiltration and insulin staining. Mice were treated as described inFig. 2. A: H-E staining of islets. Paraffin sections (10 mum) of pancreas sections prepared from the vehicle and FKGK18 groups were stained with H-E, and representative images (128 islets in 9 vehicle mice and 195 islets in 11 FKGK18 mice) are presented. Original magnification *400, scale bar = 20 mum. B: Quantitation of islet infiltration. Percent infiltration for each islet was calculated as the value of noninfiltrated area subtracted from total islet area (% infiltrate = 100 * [(total area - noninfiltrate area) / (total area)]) using ImageJ software. Data are mean +/- SEM of percent of islet infiltrated. #P less than 0.0001, FKGK18 group vs. vehicle group (n= 128 vehicle islets andn= 195 FKGK18 islets). C: Insulitis spectrum. Distribution of percentage infiltration (0-100% relative to total islet area) among individual islets from vehicle (n= 128) and FKGK18 (n= 195) groups is presented as percent of total islets. DandE: Insulin staining area in sections. beta-Cell area, as reflected by insulin staining, was calculated as percent of total pancreas area (% beta-cells = 100 * [beta-cell area sum per pancreas / pancreas area total]). Pancreas sections (from 9 vehicle and 11 FKGK18 mice) were stained for insulin (D), and the percent area of total insulin-containing stain relative to total pancreas area is presented as mean +/- SEM (E). Original magnification *400, scale bar = 50 mum. *P less than 0.05, FKGK18 group vs. vehicle group. PBS-T, PBS + 5% Tween 80. In view of reduced islet infiltration in the FKGK18 group, immunofluorescence analyses were used to estimate abundance in the infiltrate of CD4+and CD8+T cells and B cells, key components of autoimmune diabetes development (2). As shown inFig. 4None, evidence of CD4+T cells (iand ii,iiiandiv), CD8alpha+T cells (vandvi,viiandviii), and B cells (ixandx,xiandxii) was found in islets from both the vehicle and the FKGK18 groups. However, CD4+T cells and B cells per islet (Fig. 4NoneandNone), but not CD8alpha+T cells (Fig. 4None), were significantly decreased in the FKGK18 group relative to the vehicle group, suggesting that islet infiltration by certain immune cells is impeded with inactivation of iPLA2beta. Immune cell phenotyping in islet infiltrates. Paraffin sections (10 mum) of pancreas prepared from mice treated with vehicle or FKGK18 were stained for CD4+and CD8+T cells or B cells. A: Representative images of islets from vehicle and FKGK18 groups stained separately for CD4+T cells (iandii,iiiandiv), CD8alpha+T cells (vandvi,viiandviii), or B cells (B220,ixandx,xiandxii). Original magnification *400, scale bar = 50 mum. Each image was obtained from a different mouse. The immune cell populations are visualized in red, insulin in green, and nuclei in blue. B-D: Quantitation of immune cell number per islet. Data reflecting analyses of islets from a minimum of five mice per group are presented as mean +/- SEM of CD4+T cells (B, SP less than 0.001; vehicle: 7 +/- 1.38 cells/islet,n= 50; FKGK18: 2.57 +/- 0.48 cells/islet,n= 78), CD8alpha+T cells (C, not significant; vehicle: 4.13 +/- 0.75 cells/islet,n= 51; FKGK18: 3.76 +/- 0.47 cells/islet,n= 85), and B220+B cells (D, *P less than 0.05; vehicle: 101.09 +/- 24.30 cells/islet,n= 52; FKGK18: 48.71 +/- 13.03 cells/islet,n= 103). PBS-T, PBS + 5% Tween 80. PCR analyses revealed that NOD splenocytes, CD4+T cells, B cells, and bone marrow-derived macrophages all express iPLA2beta mRNA (Fig. 5None), raising the possibility that iPLA2beta activation affects their functionality. Initial studies revealed that FKGK18 exposure for up to 72 h does not compromise cell viability (Supplementary Figs. 1Noneand 2None) and reduces cytokine generation from mixed splenocytes but not macrophages (Supplementary Figs. 1None-Noneand 2None-None). Viability of and cytokine production by CD4+T cells in the absence and presence of FKGK18. Immune cells were prepared from 8-12-week-old NOD female mice for iPLA2beta mRNA, viability (by MTT assay), and cytokine/immunoglobulin production (by ELISA) analyses. A: Expression of iPLA2beta. cDNA generated from RNA isolated from splenocytes, purified CD4+T cells and B cells, and bone marrow-derived macrophages were used for iPLA2beta message analyses by RT-PCR (lane A, positive control brain;lane B, splenocytes;lane C, CD4+T cells;lane D, B cells;lane E, bone marrow-derived macrophages;lane F, islets;lane G, no template control). B: CD4+T-cell viability. Viability of cells in each well after removal of medium was assessed by MTT assay, and absorbance at 590 nm, reflecting the number of viable cells, is presented as percent of DMSO vehicle. CandD: Production of IFN-gamma, IL-2, and TNF-alpha +/- FKGK18. Media were collected at 72 h, and cytokine contents were determined by ELISA. *P less than 0.05, FKGK18 group vs. DMSO group;aP= 0.07, condition 5 vs. +DMSO (n= 3). E-G: B cells were treated with 1 mug/mL LPS + 2 ng/mL IL-4 for 72 h +/- FKGK18. E:NoneViability was assessed by MTT assay and presented as percent of DMSO vehicle. SP less than 0.0005 vs. +DMSO; #P less than 0.00005 vs. +DMSO (n= 5). F: Antibody production. IgG and IgM in the media were determined by ELISA and presented as mean +/- SEM. SP less than 0.0005 vs. +DMSO; #P less than 0.00005 vs. +DMSO; P less than 0.005 vs. +DMSO (n= 4). G: Antibody production per cell. IgG and IgM concentrations were normalized to viable cells, as reflected by MTT absorbance at 590 nm, and presented as mean +/- SEM. SP less than 0.0005 vs. +DMSO; #P less than 0.00005 vs. +DMSO; *P less than 0.05 vs. +DMSO;bP= 0.09, condition 5 vs. +DMSO (n= 4). Condition 1, -DMSO; condition 2, +DMSO; condition 3, 10-7mol/L FKGK18; condition 4, 10-6mol/L FKGK18; condition 5, 10-5mol/L FKGK18. The effects of FKGK18 (10-7-10-5mol/L, 72 h) on CD4+T-cell and B-cell function were assessed next. Exposure of CD4+T cells, activated with alphaCD3 and alphaCD28 (31), to FKGK18 had no effect on cell viability (Fig. 5None) or generation of IFN-gamma and IL-2 (Fig. 5None), but TNF-alpha generation was significantly decreased (Fig. 5None) relative to the vehicle group. In contrast, viability of B cells (Fig. 5None), activated by LPS + IL-4, was significantly reduced by FKGK18, paralleling decreases in both IgG and IgM production (Fig. 5None). However, FKGK18 (10-6mol/L) caused an ?20% greater reduction in antibody production compared with its effects on cell viability. Moreover, significant decreases in both were still evident when antibody production was normalized to cell viability (Fig. 5None). These findings suggest that sensitivity of different immune cells to iPLA2beta varies and that in addition to affecting immune cell function, iPLA2beta activation may influence B-cell survival/proliferation. To verify that the in vivo effects of FKGK18 are due to iPLA2beta inhibition, the effects of FKGK18,S-BEL (specific for iPLA2beta), andR-BEL (specific for iPLA2gamma) were compared. Cell viability with vehicle and FKGK18 exposures was similar between 24 and 72 h, suggesting that proliferation of cells was not compromised by FKGK18 (Fig. 6None). CD4+T cells were then exposed toS-BEL orR-BEL for only 30 min (4,5), unlike FKGK18, which was present for the entire 72 h. Similar to FKGK18, viability of CD4+T cells (Fig. 6None) or IFN-gamma (Fig. 6None) and IL-2 (Fig. 6None) production were not affected byR-BEL. However, unlike FKGK18,R-BEL did not inhibit TNF-alpha generation (Fig. 6None). In contrast, cell viability was significantly reduced byS-BEL (Fig. 6None), and cytokine generation was barely detectable (data not shown). These findings suggest that the in vivo effects of FKGK18 were due to inhibition of iPLA2beta and not iPLA2gamma. Comparison of FKGK18 vs. iPLA2inhibitors on viability and cytokine production in CD4+T cells. Purified CD4+T cells from 8-12-week-old NOD mice were treated with vehicle alone (DMSO) or iPLA2inhibitors (FKGK18, 10-6mol/L;S-BEL, 10-5mol/L;R-BEL, 10-5mol/L) for 72 h.A: CD4+T-cell proliferation. Viability of cells in each well after removal of medium was assessed by MTT assay and absorbance at 590 nm, reflecting the number of viable cells, and is presented as a function of FKGK18 (10-6mol/L) exposure time. B: Cell viability. Viability assessed, as described inFig. 5, is presented as percent of DMSO vehicle. #P less than 0.0001, S-BEL group vs. DMSO and FKGK18 groups; *P less than 0.05,S-BEL group vs.R-BEL group (n= 3). C-E: Cytokine production. IFN-gamma (C), IL-2 (D), and TNF-alpha (E) measured in the media by ELISA are presented as mean +/- SEM. *P less than 0.05, FKGK18 group vs. other groups (n= 3). Because CD4+T cells and TNF-alpha are critical mediators of diabetes development and we found that they are affected by iPLA2beta activation, the effects of inhibiting eicosanoid generation on TNF-alpha production from CD4+T cells was examined. The cells were exposed to inhibitors of COX (indomethacin), LOX (nordihydroguaiaretic acid [NDGA]), COX and LOX (5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid [ETYA]), or 12-LOX (cinnamyl-3,4-dihydroxy-alpha-cyanocinnamate [CDC]). In the absence of compromising cell viability (Fig. 7None), indomethacin, ETYA, and CDC mimicked FKGK18 inhibition of TNF-alpha production, but NDGA at concentrations less than 10 mumol/L, which inhibit 5-LOX but not 12-LOX, had no effect (Fig. 7None) relative to vehicle treatment. These findings provide evidence for participation of iPLA2beta-derived lipids generated by COX and 12-LOX in modulating immune cell function. This is supported by decreased PGE2generation with FKGK18, analogous to the COX inhibitors (Fig. 7None). Effects of eicosanoid inhibitors on CD4+T cells. CD4+T cells purified from 8-12-week-old NOD female mice were treated with DMSO alone or with inhibitors of COX2 (indomethacin [Indo] 10-50 mumol/L, 48 h); 5-LOX and 12-LOX (NDGA 1-10 mumol/L, 72 h); COX and LOX (ETYA 5-50 mumol/L, 72 h); or 12-LOX (CDC 0.1-10 mumol/L, 72 h). A: Cell viability. Viability assessed, as described inFig. 5, is presented as mean +/- SEM. SP less than 0.001 vs. D72 group; #P less than 0.0001 vs. D72 group; *P less than 0.05 vs. D72 group (n= 5-25). B: TNF-alpha production. TNF-alpha in the media was determined by ELISA and presented as percent of DMSO vehicle. *P less than 0.05 vs. DMSO group; P less than 0.005 vs. DMSO group; #P less than 0.0001 vs. DMSO group; SP less than 0.001 vs. DMSO group (n= 5-25). C: PGE2generation. The PGE2generation in the presence of FKGK18 (10-6mol/L) was compared with the COX inhibitors (indomethacin 30 mumol/L, ETYA 50 mumol/L). Medium from CD4+T cells was collected at the end of the inhibitor regimen, and PGE2content was determined by ELISA and presented as mean +/- SEM. *P less than 0.05 vs. DMSO group (n= 3). Given this evidence for iPLA2beta-derived lipid involvement in modulating CD4+T-cell function, we examined the ability of FKGK18 to inhibit adoptive transfer of diabetes to immunodeficient NOD. scidmice by CD4+T cells. Consistent with unchanged blood glucose levels (Fig. 8None), there was no evidence of diabetes development in untreated control and vehicle- or FKGK18 alone-treated mice (Fig. 8None). However, diabetes incidence was nearly 90% in mice following administration of CD4+T cells (Fig. 8None). In contrast, the incidence was significantly reduced to ?40% in mice that were pretreated for 1 week with FKGK18 before CD4+T-cell transfer. In comparison, initiation of FKGK18 treatment at the time of transfer or administration of cells pretreated with FKGK18 for 3 days was without protective effect (Fig. 8None). Adoptive transfer of diabetes to immunodeficient NOD. scidmice. CD4+T cells were purified from 12-week-old male BDC2.5/NOD mice (activated with alphaCD3 and alphaCD28 and expanded with IL-2) before transfer. Six-week-old male diabetes-resistant NOD. scidmice were divided into three groups: untreated (control), vehicle (PBS + 5% Tween 80 [PBS-T]), and FKGK18 alone (20 mg/kg i.p.). After 1 week, the vehicle group was either maintained with vehicle (n= 13) or administered T cells (100 muL HBSS i.p., 5 * 105cells/mouse) + vehicle (n= 16), T cells + FKGK18 (n= 12), or T cells pretreated with FKGK18 (10-6mol/L for 3 days) (n= 12). The FKGK18 group was either maintained with FKGK18 (n= 6) or administered T cells (n= 12). Once initiated, FKGK18 was administered every 48 h (20 mg/kg i.p.) until the end of the study. Blood glucose was monitored over a 14-day period to identify diabetes onset ( greater than =15.3 mmol/L). A: Blood glucose in control groups. Blood glucose levels in control, PBS-T alone, and FKGK18 alone groups. B: Diabetes incidence in control, PBS-T alone, FKGK18 alone, T cells + vehicle, and T cells + FKGK18 pretreated groups. *P less than 0.05 vs. T cells alone group; P less than 0.005 vs. T cells alone group. C: Diabetes incidence in T cells + vehicle, FKGK18-pretreated T cells, and T cells + FKGK18 administered at the same time groups. D: Proposed model of iPLA2beta role in the development of type 1 diabetes. Our earlier work suggested that iPLA2beta participates in beta-cell apoptosis through the induction of ceramide generation from hydrolysis of sphingomyelins, triggering the intrinsic apoptotic pathway (3,4,6,48). The current findings reveal an additional impact of iPLA2beta activation on immune responses. We suggest that iPLA2beta-derived lipid signals contribute to beta-cell destruction and consequential diabetes development partly through these mechanisms and that inactivation of iPLA2beta may be beneficial in ameliorating type 1 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is a consequence of autoimmune destruction of beta-cells, and there is increasing evidence of iPLA2beta induction in diabetes and for its participation in beta-cell apoptosis (3-6,13-15,32). We therefore considered the possibility that inhibition of iPLA2beta mitigates beta-cell death and ameliorates diabetes development. Consistent with this, we found that iPLA2beta expression in islets from prediabetic female NOD mice is much higher than in diabetes-resistant mice. FK-based inhibitors with variable specificity for iPLA2beta have proven to be effective in countering central nervous system-related disorders (20-22). Our characterization of FKGK18 (19), which exhibits greater specificity for iPLA2beta over other PLA2s (7,18,33), revealed FKGK18 to be more specific for iPLA2beta than iPLA2gamma and in contrast to BEL (9,16), to not inhibit other serine proteases. The NOD mouse is a model of spontaneous type 1 diabetes development, and as expected (30), ?80% of the female NOD mice developed diabetes by 25 weeks of age. In contrast, FKGK18 administration started at 10 days of age significantly reduced diabetes incidence. Concomitant observations included decreases in islet infiltration by immune cells, higher levels of circulating insulin, preservation of beta-cell area, and improved glucose homeostasis. Together, these findings suggest that inhibiting iPLA2beta may be effective in ameliorating diabetes evolution. Mass spectrometry protocols revealed that FKGK18 levels in the serum were maximum by 2-6 h but near minimal by 48 h, implying that the current regimen (three times per week) would not be expected to lead to significant accumulations of the inhibitor, therefore limiting its toxicity. Consistent with this, mice receiving FKGK18 exhibited similar body weights over 30 weeks, no discernible damage in nonislet tissues, prolonged euglycemia, and consequential survival. Taken together, these observations indicate that the FKGK18 regimen used does not promote systemic toxicity and is well tolerated. The reversible nature of FKGK18 precludes measurement of iPLA2beta activity following tissue isolation, requiring an alternate measure of iPLA2beta inhibition in vivo. BothS-BEL (34,35) and FKGK18 (19) decrease PGE2release from pancreatic islets; however, PGE2is metabolized further in vivo and thus is an unreliable measure of PLA2activity. We therefore measured urinary PGEM levels and found them to be decreased by ?25% for up to 42 h following FKGK18 administration but returned to control levels beyond 48 h, consistent with its bioavailability. Given its specificity for iPLA2beta over other PLA2s (18,19), these observations are taken as a reflection of reversible inhibition of iPLA2beta by FKGK18. Because urine was collected from chronically treated mice, the continued generation of PGEMs suggests that activities of other PLA2s are not compromised by FKGK18. Remarkably, FKGK18 dramatically reduced insulitis. Infiltration of islets by immune cells is a precursor event that leads to beta-cell destruction (30), and CD4+T cells and B cells, which independently and in concert destroy beta-cells (36), were reduced by FKGK18. These findings suggest that FKGK18 may impede immune cell migration into or proliferation within the islet. With evidence of iPLA2beta mRNA expression in immune cells, we considered the possibility that CD4+T-cell and B-cell functionality also is affected by FKGK18. Because of their importance to the development of diabetes (37), we examined whether generation of proinflammatory cytokines by immune cells from NOD mice is altered in the presence of prototypical stimulants. Generation of IFN-gamma and IL-2 by splenocytes with concanavalin A and of the chemoattractant TNF-alpha (38) by CD4+T cells with alphaCD3/alphaCD28 was reduced by FKGK18. These differences are likely due to splenocytes being an admixture of leukocytes, with the bulk being B cells and only ?10% CD4+T cells. In contrast, macrophages exposed to LPS were unaffected by FKGK18, analogous to the inability of zymosan to alter arachidonate release from macrophages treated with iPLA2beta inhibitors (39) or from iPLA2beta-deficient mice (40). The lack of effects in macrophages under the conditions tested is further evidence for the absence of nonspecific effects of FKGK18. Consistent with this,R-BEL, which is specific for the membrane-associated iPLA2gamma (16), did not inhibit TNF-alpha production from CD4+T cells. Although their precise role has not yet been clearly defined, B cells are recognized to be critical to the development of type 1 diabetes (41,42), and antibody production by B cells was reduced by FKGK18. Of all the immune cells, only B-cell viability was significantly diminished by FKGK18, suggesting differential sensitivity of these cells to iPLA2beta inhibition. This in combination with decreased infiltrate CD4+T cells, which stimulate B-cell proliferation, may account for the reductions in B cells in the islet infiltrate. These observations suggest that modulation of immune cell function may be a mechanism by which iPLA2beta-derived lipid signals participate in autoimmune beta-cell death. Recognizing the critical role of T cells and TNF-alpha in diabetes development, the effects of eicosanoid-generating pathway inhibitors on TNF-alpha production by CD4+T cells were examined. Such analyses revealed that the inhibition of TNF-alpha production by FKGK18 was mimicked by inhibitors of COX (indomethacin), COX and LOX (ETYA), and 12-LOX (CDC) but unaffected by the LOX inhibitor NDGA (at a concentration range that inhibits 5-LOX but not 12-LOX). These findings suggest that lipid signals generated by COX and 12-LOX, subsequent to iPLA2beta-mediated hydrolysis of arachidonic acid, are likely candidate modulators of immune cell function. Consistent with this, FKGK18 inhibited PGE2generation by the CD4+T cells analogous to the COX inhibitors. Contribution of COX and 12-LOX products to the autoimmune responses is supported by reports that PGE2release is significantly higher from NOD islets that are infiltrated versus noninfiltrated (43) and that deletion of 12/15-LOX protects against diabetes development (44). Further analyses using specific inhibitors of the eicosanoid-generating pathways are expected to more definitively identify the relevant eicosanoids. The role for iPLA2beta-derived lipid signals in type 1 diabetes development is strengthened by the findings that adoptive transfer of diabetes to NOD. scidmice, which are immunodeficient and diabetes resistant, by CD4+T cells is mitigated by pretreatment of the mice with FKGK18. However, administration of T cells and FKGK18 simultaneously was ineffective in mitigating diabetes development, suggesting that in vivo, iPLA2beta activation permits immune cell responses and that to counter this effect, iPLA2beta inhibition must occur before islet onslaught by immune cells. Furthermore, no protection from diabetes development could be demonstrated with transfer of FKGK18-pretreated T cells, and this most likely reflects the reversible nature of FKGK18 and its limited bioavailability beyond 3 days. Although we found that inhibiting iPLA2beta may be beneficial in mitigating type 1 diabetes evolution, its participation in multiple biological processes (9) presents the potential for deleterious consequences with global iPLA2beta inhibition. It has been proposed that iPLA2beta plays a housekeeping role to generate substrates for reincorporation into phospholipids. However, several lines of investigation have suggested that modulation of iPLA2beta does not affect membrane phospholipids in islets or other tissues (45,46); thus, FKGK18 is not expected to alter membrane lipid composition. We and others have described a signal transduction role for iPLA2beta, including its amplification of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (35,47). That it is counterintuitive to inhibit iPLA2beta to achieve euglycemia, however, is allayed by the observations that1) iPLA2beta is increased, not decreased, in diabetes-prone mice;2) fasting blood glucose levels in FKGK18-treated mice are not elevated relative to vehicle-treated NOD mice;3) circulating levels of insulin are higher in the FKGK18 group; and4) glucose tolerance is improved in the FKGK18 group in contrast to abnormal glucose tolerance in iPLA2beta-deficient mice (47). In summary, chronic inhibition of iPLA2beta with FKGK18 preserves beta-cell mass and reduces autoimmune type 1 diabetes incidence (Fig. 8None). With evidence for iPLA2beta expression in NOD beta-cells and immune cells and for mitigation of immune cell function with iPLA2beta inhibition, we suggest that lipids derived from beta-cell or immune cell iPLA2beta activation play critical signaling roles to promote recruitment, infiltration, or function of immune cells and that inhibition of iPLA2beta may be beneficial in ameliorating diabetes.
