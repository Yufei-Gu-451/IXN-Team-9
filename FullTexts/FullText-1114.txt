Aluminium (Al)-inducible organic acid (OA) secretion from plant roots is an important mechanism controlling the degree of resistance to Al toxicity in many plant species (RyanNone., 2001;KochianNone., 2004;DelhaizeNone., 2012). These plant species can be divided into two groups based on the timing of secretion (MaNone., 2001). In the pattern I type, roots secrete OAs immediately upon suffering Al stress; wheat (Triticum aestivum) and buckwheat (Fygopyrum esculentumMoench) are examples of this pattern. In plants of the pattern II type, an induction period after the onset of Al stress is required before the roots secrete OAs;Cassia toraand sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) fit this pattern. The major difference between the two patterns lies in whether or not gene induction is required for OA secretion. The malate transporter geneALUMINIUM-ACTIVATED MALATE TRANSPORTER 1(ALMT1) was first isolated in wheat (SasakiNone., 2004), and homologous genes have been isolated inArabidopsis(HoekengaNone., 2006) and oilseed rape (Brassica napus) (LigabaNone., 2006). Genes involved in Al-induced citrate secretion, which are members of the multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) family, have also been isolated in barley (Hordeum vulgare) (FurukawaNone., 2007), sorghum (MagalhaesNone., 2007),Arabidopsis(LiuNone., 2009), maize (Zea mays) (MaronNone., 2010), wheat (RyanNone., 2009), rye (Secale cereale) (YokoshoNone., 2010), rice (Oryza sativa) (YokoshoNone., 2011) and rice bean (Vigna umbellata) (YangNone., 2011). However, the mechanisms regulating the expression of these genes are not clear. Protein phosphorylation has been implicated in Al-inducible OA secretion. For example, protein kinase inhibitors have been demonstrated to block Al-activated malate secretion from wheat roots (Osawa and Matsumoto, 2001) and citrate secretion from soybean (Glycine max) roots (ShenNone., 2004). AsALMT1is expressed constitutively in wheat roots (SasakiNone., 2004), it is reasonable to deduce that these inhibitors may have been acting on the protein rather than on the pathways regulating expression. LigabaNone. (2009)generated a series of mutations targeting possible phosphorylation sites on TaALMT1, and expression of some of these mutant proteins inXenopusoocytes resulted in altered current events either in the absence or presence of Al. However,KobayashiNone. (2007)demonstrated that malate secretion fromArabidopsisroots under Al stress requires protein phosphorylation, which acts onAtALMT1at both transcriptional and post-translational levels. These results indicated that protein phosphorylation could be important for OA secretion from plant roots with either the pattern I or pattern II response. InArabidopsis, both malate and citrate are secreted from roots in response to Al stress (HoekengaNone., 2003). Expression of bothAtMATE1andAtALMT1requires SENSITIVE TO PROTON RHIZOTOXICITY 1 (STOP1), a putative Cys2His2-type zinc-finger transcription factor involved in low pH resistance and Al tolerance inArabidopsis(IuchiNone., 2007;LiuNone., 2009). YamajiNone. (2009)identified the rice transcription factor ALUMINIUM RESISTANCE TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 1 (ART1), which regulates 31 genes implicated in both internal and external detoxification of Al at different cellular levels. Among these, the expression ofOsFRDL4, which mediates Al-activated citrate secretion from rice roots, requires ART1 (YokoshoNone., 2011). Both STOP1 inArabidopsisand ART1 in rice are expressed constitutively, indicating that Al may trigger the post-translational regulation of both transcription factors to affect downstream gene expression. Rice bean is an Al-resistant species and is well adapted to grow on acid soils by means of secretion of citrate from root apices (YangNone., 2006). However, citrate secretion upon Al exposure is delayed by several hours, suggesting a pattern II response for this species. Recently, we isolated a gene responsible for Al-inducible citrate secretion from rice bean roots,VuMATE1(YangNone., 2011). In the absence of Al stress,VuMATE1is not expressed (YangNone., 2011). This study sought to clarify the interplay betweenVuMATE1expression and citrate secretion in rice bean to elucidate the underlying regulatory mechanisms. The results demonstrated that, although citrate secretion was specific to Al stress,VuMATE1expression was not, and it was found that citrate secretion comprised a complex regulation pathway involving bothde novoprotein biosynthesis and reversible protein phosphorylation. Furthermore, we characterized the 5' flanking sequence of theVuMATE1gene, which containscis-acting elements regulating both root tip-specific and Al-inducible gene expression. Seeds of rice bean (V. umbellata) were soaked in deionized water overnight, and germinated at 26 oC in the dark. After germination, the seeds were transferred to a net floating on a 0.5mM CaCl2solution (pH 4.5). The solution was renewed daily. On d 3, seedlings were transferred to a 1.2 l plastic pot (eight seedlings per pot) containing aerated nutrient solution. The nutrient solution contained the following macro- and micronutrients (muM): CaSO4(200), CaCl2(200), MgSO4(100), KNO3(400), NH4NO3(300), NaH2PO4(5), H3BO3(3), MnCl2(0.5), ZnSO4(0.4), CuSO4(0.2), Fe-EDTA (10), and (NH4)6Mo7O24(1). The solution was adjusted to pH 4.5 with HCl and renewed daily. The plants, which were grown for an additional 3-5 d in an environmentally controlled growth room with a 14h/26 oC day (light intensity of 300 mumol photons m-2s-1) and a 10h/22 oC night regime, were used for the following experiments. Root apices (apical 10mm) were excised with a razor blade, and ten root apices were incubated at 26 oC in a 5ml centrifuge tube containing 3ml of 0.5mM CaCl2solution (pH 4.5; Ca solution). Root apices were rinsed with the Ca solution three times (10min each) to diminish ion leakage derived from cutting damage. During all incubation periods, root apices were shaken at 80rpm. For the time-course study, root apices were exposed to Ca solution containing either 25 muM AlCl3(Al solution) or 25 muM LaCl3every 3h,and the old solutions and roots were collected at each time point. The protein translation inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) and the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D were dissolved in deionized water and applied at a final concentration of 20 and 10 muM, respectively. Protein kinase and protein phosphatase inhibitors K252a and cyclosporin A were applied at a final concentration of 5 muM. They were first dissolved in a small amount of dimethyl sulfoxide and then added to treatment solutions. The effects of various inhibitors on gene expression and citrate secretion were determined in two ways. The first set of experiments was carried out by incubating the root apices in inhibitors for 1h, rinsing the roots with fresh Ca solution, and then transferring them to either Ca solution or Al solution for various periods. The second set of experiments was carried out by incubating the root apices in Al solution for 6h, rinsing the roots with fresh Ca solution, and then treating them with various inhibitors for 3h. Citrate concentrations were determined according to the enzymatic method described byZhaoNone. (2003). Briefly, to 1ml of treatment solution, 120 muLl 1M Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.8) and 15 mul 10mM NADH were added. After incubation at 25 oC for 40min, 2 mul enzyme mixture (containing 1.25U lactate dehydrogenase and 0.5U malate dehydrogenase) was added and the reaction mixture was incubated for a further 40min. The change inA340was monitored after the reaction was initiated with citrate lyase (0.5U). Standard measurements were performed using the same procedure. Plant material was ground in liquid nitrogen and total RNA was extracted using an RNAplant_plus kit (Tiangen, Shanghai, China). First-strand cDNAs were synthesized from 1 mug total RNA using a PrimeScriptTMRT-PCR Kit (Takara Bio, Japan), and diluted to 50-100ng mul-1. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed on a LightCycler480 machine (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) using a SYBR PremixEx Taq kit (Takara Bio). The primer pairs used have been described previously (YangNone., 2011). Three biological replicate RNA/cDNA samples were generated, and each cDNA sample was tested with three technical replicates, from which the relative expression was calculated against that of the internal control 18S rRNA gene using the formula 2-DeltaDeltaNonep. The 1.55kbVuMATE1promoter was obtained according to the user manual of the GenomeWalkerTMUniversal Kit (Clontech, CA, USA). In brief, four genome walker libraries were constructed by digesting separate aliquots of DNA with four different restriction enzymes (DraI,EcoRV,PvuII, andStuI), followed by ligation to a genome walker adaptor. Nested PCR was performed using the outer/inner adaptor primer provided by the kit and twoVuMATE1gene-specific primers (5'-TTGGTGCTGAAAGATGACTGGAGAAGTGAT-3' and 5'-GATCTTCTACATTGGGTGCCTAACT-3'). After the nested PCR, amplified fragments were cloned into the pMD18-T vector (Takara Bio). The sequences that extended upstream of the cDNA clones were isolated as the 5'-upstream regions of the gene. The 1.55kbVuMATE1promoter was amplified from genomic DNA (primers MATE1GUSfor 5'-NoneTAAGGCTCGCA CAAGCTTCA-3' and MATE1GUSrev 5'-NoneTAATGAATT TTGATGAACTC-3') and cloned into the pMD18-T vector (Takara Bio). The correct nucleotide sequence was verified and subcloned into the multicloning site betweenKpnI andNcoI of pCAMBIA1301. The generatedVuMATE1p::GUS construct was introduced into theAgrobacterium tumefaciensstrain EHA105, andA. tumefaciens-mediated transformation ofArabidopsisplants (Col-0) was accomplished according to the floral dip protocol (Clough and Bent, 1998). T1 seeds were surface sterilized and plated on one-half strength MS medium supplemented with hygromycin. The resistant plants were transferred to soil and allowed to set seed (T2). Transgenic lines that displayed a 3:1 ratio for hygromycin resistance in the T3 generation were selected for further analysis. All experiments were performed using plants corresponding to the T4 generation. GUS staining was performed according to the method ofJeffersonNone. (1987)after exposure to Al (1.0 muM activity) at pH 5.0. Seedlings were observed and photographed with a Nikon AZ100 microscope. There is a lag phase for secretion of citrate from the intact roots of rice bean in response to Al treatment (YangNone., 2006), which is typical of pattern II OA release. To establish whether gene induction was required for this pattern II response, we performed a time-course analysis of citrate secretion andVuMATE1expression in the root apex. Citrate secretion rates were equivalent in both Al-treated and control plants at the first 3h time point (Fig. 1A). Citrate secretion rates remained unchanged for the duration of the treatment in the absence of Al, but increased with Al treatment, reaching a steady state after 6-9h of treatment. In parallel, no signals could be detected forVuMATE1mRNA in the absence of Al treatment, and only very low levels of expression were observed within 3h of Al treatment. However, the transcript abundance ofVuMATE1greatly increased after 6h of Al treatment and then decreased to relatively low levels thereafter (Fig. 1B). Our previous study demonstrated thatVuMATE1expression remained constant after reaching a maximum by 6h of Al exposure (YangNone., 2011). This discrepancy might arise from the different experimental conditions used, i.e. whole roots in the previous study and excised root apices in the present study. From the above results, it was clear that, in addition to the lag between the onset of Al stress andVuMATE1expression, there was a further 3h lag between gene induction and citrate secretion. Citrate release andVuMATE1expression time series. (A) Induction of citrate secretion from root apices of rice bean by Al treatment. Excised root apices (10mm in length) were placed in 0.5mM CaCl2solution containing 0 or 25 muM Al. Data are means +/- standard deviation (SD) of three independent experiments (n=3 for each experiment). (B) Time course ofVuMATE1expression in the roots of rice bean in response to Al treatment. Expression levels were normalized to that of the 18S rRNA gene and then to the expression ofVuMATE1in root apices at 3h of Al treatment, which was arbitrarily fixed at 1. VuMATE1expression in root apices treated with 0.5mM CaCl2solution for 12h was included. Results are shown as mean expression +/-SD of three independent experiments. n.d. indicates that no signal was detected. The inset shows semi-quantitative RT-PCR ofVuMATE1expression. Several lanthanides such as La3+and Yb3+have ionic properties similar to those of Al3+in an aqueous solution. In the Al-resistant wheat genotype ET8, these lanthanides can induce malate secretion (KataokaNone., 2002). However, whetherTaALMT1induction is involved in lanthanide-induced malate secretion from wheat roots is not clear. In our previous study, we demonstrated that rice bean roots did not respond to La stress in terms of citrate secretion, indicating that citrate secretion is specific to Al stress in rice bean (YangNone., 2011). To determine whetherVuMATE1expression was specific to Al treatment as well, we exposed root apices to La stress treatment. Citrate secretion rates were equivalent in both La-stressed roots and controls during the entire 12h of treatment (Fig. 2A). However,VuMATE1expression was induced by La stress and the timing of expression was similar to that under Al stress, although the expression level was lower in La-stressed roots than in Al-stressed roots (Figs 1Band2B). Time course of citrate release andVuMATE1expression in the roots of rice bean in response to LaCl3treatment. (A) Induction of citrate secretion from root apices of rice bean by La treatment. Excised root apices (10mm in length) were placed in 0.5mM CaCl2solution containing 0 or 25 muM La. Data are means +/-SD of three independent experiments (n=3 for each experiment). (B) Time course ofVuMATE1expression in the roots of rice bean in response to La treatment. Expression levels were normalized to that of the 18S rRNA gene and then toVuMATE1expression in the root apices at 3h of La treatment, which was arbitrarily fixed at 1. Results are shown as mean expression +/-SD of three independent experiments. We demonstrated previously that application of CHX, a broad translation inhibitor, effectively inhibited Al-triggered citrate secretion from the intact roots of rice bean (YangNone., 2006). To examine whetherde novobiosynthesis of proteins was required forVuMATE1induction, CHX was applied in two sets of experiments. First, excised root apices were treated with or without CHX for 1h and then moved to Ca solution with or without Al. CHX pre-treatment completely blocked Al-inducible citrate secretion during the following 9h of Al exposure. CHX pre-treatment also resulted in inhibition ofVuMATE1expression by 65% (Fig. 3). The time course analysis ofVuMATE1expression with CHX pre-treatment showed that the transcript abundance was very low in the first 6h of Al exposure (data not shown), indicating that theVuMATE1expression detected at the 9h time point was probably due to diminishing CHX action. In the absence of Al stress,VuMATE1expression was not detected, irrespective of treatment with CHX or not. These results implied thatde novoprotein biosynthesis is required forVuMATE1expression, and rule out the possible involvement of a repressor protein suppressingVuMATE1transcription in the absence of Al. Effect of protein-synthesis inhibitor (CHX, 20 muM) pre-treatment on the activation of citrate secretion from rice bean roots by Al treatment. Root apices pre-incubated for 1h in 0.5mM CaCl2solution with or without CHX were transferred to solutions with or without Al for 9h. (A) Root exudates were collected for measurement of citrate. Results are shown as means +/-SD of three independent experiments (n=3 for each experiment). (B) Root apices were used to analyse gene expression. Expression ofVuMATE1was analysed by quantitative RT-PCR, using the 18S rRNA gene as a reference. Results are shown as mean expression +/-SD of three independent experiments. n.d. indicates that no signal was detected. Secondly, root apices were treated with Al for 6h and then moved to Al-containing solution (as a control) or Al-free solution with or without CHX for 3h (CHX post-treatment;Fig. 4A). In comparison with continued Al stress, withdrawal of Al had no effect on citrate efflux during the following 3h of treatment (Fig. 4B), indicating either that Al is not required for citrate efflux after gene induction or that the residual Al was sufficient to maintain secretion. However, when CHX was included in the medium, secretion of citrate was almost completely blocked (Fig. 4B). In parallel, there were no significant differences inVuMATE1transcript abundance between continuous Al stress and withdrawal of Al, and the expression under both conditions was significantly lower than that after 6h of Al stress (Fig. 4C). TheVuMATE1mRNA decreased to a very low level with CHX post-treatment (Fig. 4C). These results indicated that the translation ofVuMATE1into protein after gene induction is the critical step for citrate secretion. To rule out the contribution ofVuAMTE1transcription to citrate efflux in this experiment, we used the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D. Application of actinomycin D to pre-activated root apices completely inhibitedVuMATE1expression but had no effect on citrate secretion (Fig. 4). Effect of a translation inhibitor (CHX, 20 muM) or a transcription inhibitor (actinomycin D) on pre-activated citrate secretion from rice bean roots. (A) Summary of treatment conditions. Root apices were pre-incubated in Al (25 muM) for 6h (shaded bar), and transferred to Al solution (+Al; filled bar) or to Ca solution with CHX (-Al+CHX; striped bar), actinomycin D (-Al+actinomycin D; hatched bar), or neither (-Al; open bar) for 3h. (B) Root exudates were collected for citrate measurement. Results are shown as means +/-SD of three independent experiments (n=3 for each experiment). (C) Root apices were used to analyse gene expression. For comparison,VuMATE1expression in pre-activated roots (Al 6h) was included. Expression ofVuMATE1was analysed by quantitative RT-PCR, using the 18S rRNA gene as a reference. Results are shown as mean expression +/-SD of three independent experiments. Protein phosphorylation has been implicated in Al-induced malate and citrate secretion from plant roots (Osawa and Matsumoto, 2001;ShenNone., 2004;LigabaNone., 2009). We examined whether reversible protein phosphorylation affected Al-inducible citrate secretion in rice bean roots by perturbing protein kinase and phosphatase function using the protein kinase inhibitor K252a and the protein phosphatase inhibitor cyclosporin A. These inhibitors were applied in two sets of experiments. First, inhibitors were used to pre-treat root apices before Al exposure. Pre-treatment with either K252a or cyclosporin A completely blocked Al-induced citrate secretion from root apices during the following 9h (Fig. 5A). There are various levels at which reversible protein phosphorylation could regulate Al-inducible citrate secretion: acting on VuMATE1 protein to modulate transport activity, influencingVuMATE1expression, or both. After 6h of Al exposure,VuMATE1expression was not detected in root apices pre-treated by the inhibitors, and after 9h of Al exposure, it was only beginning to be expressed (Fig. 5B), indicating that protein phosphorylation is required for transcriptional regulation ofVuMATE1expression. Effect of protein kinase inhibitor or protein phosphatase inhibitor pre-treatment on the activation of citrate secretion from rice bean roots. Root apices pre-incubated for 1h in 0.5mM CaCl2solution containing 5 muM protein kinase inhibitor K252a, 5 muM protein phosphatase inhibitor cyclosporin A, or neither were transferred to solutions with or without Al for 9h. (A) Root exudates were collected for measurement of citrate. Results are shown as means +/-SD of three independent experiments (n=3 for each experiment). (B) Root apices were used to analyse gene expression. Expression ofVuMATE1was analysed by quantitative RT-PCR, using the 18S rRNA gene as a reference. Results are shown as mean expression +/-SD of three independent experiments. n.d. indicates that no signal was detected. Secondly, these inhibitors were used to treat root apices already stressed by Al in order to examine the effect of these inhibitors on transcribedVuMATE1. Root apices were treated with Al for 6h and then transferred to Ca solution with or without the inhibitors (Fig. 6A). In comparison with Ca solution, application of cyclosporin A had no effect on citrate secretion, whilst K252a decreased citrate secretion by 47% (Fig. 6B). In parallel, these inhibitors had no effect onVuMATE1expression (Fig. 6C). The results indicated that a K252a-sensitive protein kinase is involved in post-transcriptional regulation of VuMATE1 activity. Effect of protein kinase inhibitor (K252a, 5 muM) or protein phosphatase inhibitor (cyclosporin A, 5 muM) on pre-activated citrate secretion from rice bean roots. (A) Treatment conditions. Root apices were pre-incubated in Al (25 muM) for 6h, and transferred to Ca solution with cyclosporin A (-Al+cyclosporin A; striped bar), K252a (-Al+K252a; hatched bar) or neither (-Al; open bar) for 3h. (B) Root exudates were collected for citrate measurement. Results are shown as means +/-SD of three independent experiments (n=3 for each experiment). (C) Root apices were used to analyse gene expression. Expression of Vu-MATE1was analysed by quantitative RT-PCR, using the 18S rRNA gene as a reference. Results are shown as mean expression +/-SD of three independent experiments. To analyse further the expression pattern and location ofVuMATE1, a 1.55kb DNA sequence upstream of the start codon was isolated. This promoter fragment was fused to aGUSreporter gene and transformed into wild-typeArabidopsisbyAgrobacterium-mediated transformation. In the absence of Al stress, GUS staining was not observed in the root apex (Fig. 7A). After a 3h exposure of the roots to Al, GUS staining appeared from the central cylinder, and extended to the entire root apex after prolonged exposure (Fig. 7B-D). In the mature root, the vascular cylinder was the site of GUS activity independent of Al stress, whilst the cortical and epidermis cells did not show expression (Fig. 7E-H). VuMATE1p::GUS expression in transgenic plants. Ten-d-old seedlings were treated with modified one-fifth-strength Hoagland solution (pH 5.0) containing 7 muM Al3+(1 muM activity) for 0 (A, E), 3 (B, F), 6 (C, G), or 9 (D, H) h. (A)-(D) show the root apex, and (E)-(H) show the mature zone. Al-induced citrate secretion is a major Al tolerance mechanism in both dicots and monocots, mediated by members of the MATE family (DelhaizeNone., 2012). VuMATE1 is responsible for Al-activated citrate secretion in rice bean roots (YangNone., 2011). We have shown here that the function of VuMATE1 under Al stress is subject to both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation, and thatVuMATE1expression is necessary but not sufficient for citrate secretion in rice bean. Citrate secretion was more tightly regulated by VuMATE1 protein activity than by the pattern of gene expression. First, whereas La treatment enhanced accumulation ofVuMATE1mRNA, it did not increase the rate of citrate secretion from the root apex (Fig. 2). Secondly,VuMATE1expression was maximal after 6h of Al exposure, but citrate secretion rates took until 9h of Al exposure to reach their maximum (Fig. 1). This inconsistency suggests either that it takes about 3h to translateVuMATE1mRNA into protein or that regulation of the transport activity of VuMATE1 depends on some other activating factors. Thirdly, actinomycin D was able to completely inhibitVuMATE1expression but had no effect on citrate secretion once the root apex had been pre-activated by Al stress (Fig. 4). Finally, the protein kinase inhibitor K252a could block citrate secretion without reducingVuMATE1expression levels (Fig. 6). VuMATE1is upregulated by Al stress, suggesting the involvement of upstream sensing and/or signalling components. Recent studies on rice andArabidopsishave identified ART1 (YamajiNone., 2009) and STOP1 (LiuNone., 2009) as the core components regulatingMATEandALMTgenes involved in OA secretion. It is reasonable to infer that a functional homologue of STOP1 or ART1 also exists in rice bean. As neitherSTOP1inArabidopsisnorART1in rice expression is induced by Al, the signal transduction pathway probably involves post-transcriptional and post-translational regulation of both regulators. It can be assumed that STOP1 and ART1 proteins accumulate upon Al stress and activate gene transcription, or that protein abundance is not affected but instead the proteins are activated directly by the Al signal. In rice bean, pre-treatment with CHX for 1h resulted in inhibition ofVuMATE1transcription (Fig. 3), implying that regulator(s) involved inVuMATE1expression need to be synthesizedde novo. We have demonstrated that reversible protein phosphorylation is necessary forVuMATE1expression and citrate secretion. Reversible protein phosphorylation is also implicated in Al-induced malate secretion from the wheat root apex and citrate secretion from soybean roots (Osawa and Matsumoto, 2001;ShenNone., 2004). However, the question arises as to whether protein kinases and phosphatases act upstream or downstream of transporters to regulate OA secretion. Pre-treatment with the protein kinase inhibitor K252a or protein phosphatase inhibitor cyclosporin A blocked citrate secretion, which closely followed the blocking of gene expression (Fig. 5). This indicated that both protein kinases and phosphatases are required to activate regulators acting upstream ofVuMATE1. This is consistent with similar experiments inArabidopsis, where both a protein kinase inhibitor (staurosporine) and a phosphatase inhibitor (calyculin A) reduce Al-induced malate secretion, probably due to a reduction inAtALMT1expression (KobayashiNone., 2007). On the other hand, we further demonstrated that protein kinases are also involved in post-transcriptional regulation of VuMATE1 activity. When Al was withdrawn from the solution bathing the root apex, citrate secretion rates remained unchanged (Figs 4Band6B). Cyclosporin A application did not interfere with secretion rates; however, K252a treatment reduced citrate secretion rates by 47% (Fig. 6B). Because the non-inhibitory or inhibitory effects of cyclosporin A or K252a, respectively, on citrate secretion were not related to the pattern of gene expression (Fig. 6C), it is reasonable to speculate that K252a-sensitive protein kinases are involved in activating or maintaining the activity of the VuMATE1 transporter. We demonstrated previously that the expression ofVuMATE1is entirely Al-induced and restricted to the root apex (YangNone., 2011). In the present study, the reporter gene (GUS), when driven by the 5' flanking sequence of theVuMATE1gene, exhibited temporal and spatial expression patterns similar to those observed by RT-PCR analysis of gene expression (Fig. 7;YangNone., 2011). However, we also observed constitutive expression of reporter activity in the vascular cylinder of the mature root region. FujiiNone. (2012)reported that barleyHvAACT1is typically expressed in the pericycle cells of the root mature zone, functioning as a citrate transporter required for Fe nutrition. However, in Al-tolerant barley cultivars, a 1kb insertion upstream of theHvAACT1coding region changes the location of expression to the root tip, thereby protecting the root tip from Al toxicity (FujiiNone., 2012). Whether VuMATE1 plays two physiological roles in both detoxifying Al toxicity and regulating Fe translocation has yet to be investigated. The root tip is the major site for Al toxicity (RyanNone., 1993). Only when the expression of Al tolerance genes is confined to this critical area is detoxification capacity maximized. For instance, although a moderate amount of citrate is secreted fromArabidopsisroots under Al stress, the role ofAtMATE1in Al resistance is diminished, as its expression is localized to the mature root regions (LiuNone., 2012). The restricted spatial distribution of Al-induced expression ofVuMATE1andGUSto the root apex suggested thatcis-acting elements involved in root tip-specific expression are present in the 5' flanking sequence of theVuMATE1gene. In addition to the presence of root tip-specific elements, there are Al-inducible sequences within the promoter ofVuMATE1. To date,MATEgenes involved in Al-mediated citrate secretion have been isolated from at least nine plant species (DelhaizeNone., 2012). However, unlikeVuMATE1, which is not transcribed in the root apex in the absence of Al (Fig. 7A), otherMATEgenes exhibit varying degrees of constitutive expression, e.g. HvAACT1expression in barley is not affected by Al andSbMATEexpression in sorghum is further increased by Al stress (FurukawaNone., 2007;MagalhaesNone., 2007). Although the transgenic approach has been proven to be a useful strategy for genetic improvement of plant performance in acidic soils, most of the transgenes are driven by constitutive promoters. For example, overexpression ofVuMATE1under the control of the CaMV35S promoter in tomato results in citrate secretion in the absence of Al (YangNone., 2011). Considering that the efflux of OA anions constitutes a significant carbon cost to plants and may affect plant growth, and that transcription of genes consumes additional energy, limiting the expression of Al tolerance genes to only when Al toxicity occurs constitutes an efficient resource-saving strategy. Thus, dissection ofcis-acting elements that regulate Al-inducible gene expression will be useful for genetic improvement of Al resistance through promoter reconstruction. However, thecis-acting sequences regulating root tip-specific gene expression and responsible for Al-inducible gene expression need further characterization. In summary, we have demonstrated that the regulation of citrate secretion in response to Al stress operates on multiple levels. As illustrated inFig. 8, at least four steps are involved in the process. In step 1, transcription factor(s) or upstream control elements are synthesizedde novoafter sensing of the Al stress signal. In step 2, reversible protein phosphorylation is directly or indirectly involved in the interaction of transcription factors with the promoter ofVuMATE1to initiate the transcription ofVuMATE1. As the accumulation ofVuMATE1mRNA and the appearance of GUS activity driven by the promoter ofVuMATE1began after 3h of Al exposure (Figs 1and7), it takes about 3h to complete the first two steps. In step 3, the full induction ofVuMATE1mRNA requires about 3h; at this time point, a portion of the mRNA has been translated into functional protein, as citrate secretion has begun. In step 4, translation of the majority ofVuMATE1mRNA into protein and translational modification are required for maximal citrate secretion, and this step may take about 3h, as the maximum secretion of citrate occurred after 9h of exposure to Al stress (Fig. 1). We also demonstrated that the promoter ofVuMATE1containscis-acting elements regulating both root tip-specific and Al-inducible gene expression, which provides an important resource for generation of crop varieties more suitable for growth on acidic soils. Hypothetical model for Al-induced citrate secretion from roots of a typical pattern II-type rice bean plant. At least four steps are involved in the process. Step 1: Al3+interacts with a receptor (R) on the plasma membrane to initiate a signal transduction pathway, which triggers thede novobiosynthesis of an unidentified transcription factor (TF). Step 2: reversible protein phosphorylation is required for the TF to interact with sequences in the promoter ofVuMATE1and induce its expression. Step 3: translation of Vu-MATE1mRNA into protein. Step 4: a K252a-sensitive protein kinase is involved in the phosphorylation of VuMATE1 for activation of VuMATE1 to transport citrate out of the cell through the plasma membrane.
