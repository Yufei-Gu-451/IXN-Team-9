Inflammation plays a critical role in many widely occurring diseases and there now is a general consensus that failed endogenous resolution mechanisms can lead to uncontrolled and chronic inflammationNone,None. Uncontrolled inflammation is regarded as a critical component of the pathogenesis of two major diseases of the ocular surface, dry eye and allergic conjunctivitis, as well as dermatitis in the skinNone,None. Active resolution of the acute inflammatory response is orchestrated by a novel family of anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving mediators termed resolvins, which are a part of a wider genus of pro-resolving mediatorsNone,None. Histamine plays a central role in promoting allergic conjunctivitisNoneand is known to directly stimulate conjunctival goblet cell mucin secretionNone. Martin et al recently demonstrated that RvD1 regulates histamine release by mast cell degranulationNone. Herein, we addressed whether RvD1 could regulate the action of histamine on goblet cell secretion and characterized the histamine response by these cells. Recently, we found that resolvins of the D and E series (RvD1 and RvE1) regulate leukotriene-stimulated conjunctival goblet cell mucin secretion as can occur in the setting of allergic conjunctivitisNone. Here we report that RvD1 interacts with its receptor GPR32 to block histamine-stimulated responses of conjunctival goblet cells that include increase in [Ca2+]i, activation of extracellular regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, and secretion of high molecular weight glycoproteins including MUC5AC mucin. First, we determined if histamine alters [Ca2+]iusing the intracellular Ca2+probe fura-2 in cultured human conjunctival goblet cells. Histamine increased [Ca2+]iin a concentration-dependent manner with a maximum increase obtained at 10-5M (Figure 1 A and B). We used RvD1 and its epimer AT-RvD1 that is produced in the presence of aspirinNone,None. In goblet cells exposure to either RvD1 or AT-RvD1 (10-10-10-8M) blocked histamine stimulated increases in [Ca2+]ithat were reduced by a maximum of 72.3 +/- 24.2 and52.6 +/- 23.%, respectively (Figure 1C and D). In rat goblet cells, histamine also increased [Ca2+]iwith maximum levels at 10-6M a decreased concentration of histamine compared to that which was maximum for human cells (Figure 1E and F). At concentrations as low as 10-11M, both RvD1 and AT-RvD1 significantly blocked the histamine stimulated increases in [Ca2+]i(Figure 1G and H). A maximum inhibition of secretion of 82.3 +/- 0.3, and 83.9 +/- 6.4%. was obtained by RvD1 and AT-RvD1, respectively (Figure 1G and H). To examine the time-dependency of their effects, RvD1 and AT-RvD1 were each added simultaneously with histamine or 50 sec after histamine at the peak of [Ca2+]iresponse (Figure 2A - D). When histamine and RvD1 or AT-RvD1 were added simultaneously, the peak [Ca2+]iwas significantly decreased compared to histamine alone (Figure 2A - D). In contrast, when RvD1 or AT-RvD1 were added at the peak of the histamine response, the [Ca2+]iwas not altered when the change in [Ca2+]i(Figure 2A - D) was monitored or when the slope was calculated (data not shown). Both D-series resolvins when added before (Figure 1D and H) or together (Figure 2A - D) with histamine blocked the increase in [Ca2+]istimulated by histamine. However, these resolvins could not alter the histamine Ca2+response if they were added within a minute after histamine had initiated the release of Ca2+i. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) including histamine receptors release Ca2+from intracellular capacitative Ca2+stores located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)None,None. Ca2+release in turn activates Ca2+influx from extracellular stores. The intracellular Ca2+stores are refilled by Ca2+ATPase pumping Ca2+back into the ER. As thapsigargin depletes the intracellular Ca2+store by blocking the Ca2+ATPase, thapsigargin can be used to evaluate use of this storeNone. To determine if resolvins decrease [Ca2+]iby preventing the release of this store, we measured the effect of resolvins on thapsigargin-induced [Ca2+]iin the presence of extracellular Ca2+. Histamine alone and thapsagargin alone increased [Ca2+]iby 205.7 +/- 48.7 and 146.8 +/- 70.1 nM, respectively (Figure 2E). When RvD1 or AT-RvD1 was added before thapsigargin, the thapsigargin induced increase in [Ca2+]iwas not altered (Figure 2E). When the thapsigargin response was followed by addition of histamine, the histamine response was significantly decreased compared to histamine alone. When RvD1 or AT-RvD1 were followed by thapsagargin and then histamine, the histamine response was unchanged compared to the histamine response that followed the thapsagargin response. (Figure 2E). In support of this finding, we demonstrated earlier that after removal of extracellular Ca2+a small increase in [Ca2+]iremained after histamine 10-5M stimulation. None,NoneThese results suggest that RvD1 and AT-RvD1 block the histamine-stimulated increase in [Ca2+]iby either directly altering the histamine receptor or affecting a step before the release of intracellular Ca2+. We next investigated if histamine affects extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 activity. Rat conjunctival goblet cells were stimulated with histamine and ERK1/2 activity measured by western blotting analysis. Histamine increased ERK1/2 activity in a concentration dependent manner with a maximum at 10-6M (Figure 3A). Histamine also activated ERK1/2 in time-dependent manner with a maximum stimulation at 5 min (Figure 3B). Hence, at physiologic levels histamine activates ERK1/2 along with elevating [Ca2+]i. To determine if D-series resolvins block histamine stimulation of ERK1/2 activity, we exposed rat goblet cells to resolvins for 30 min before stimulation with histamine at 10-5M for 5 min. Both RvD1 and AT-RvD1 significantly inhibited histamine stimulated ERK1/2 activity with RvD1 inhibiting by a maximum of 94.0 +/- 7.7 and AT-RvD1 by 81.9 +/- 20.9% (Figure 3C). When goblet cell secretion was investigated, RvD1 or AT-RvD1 exposure completely blocked secretion stimulated by histamine (10-5M) in human goblet cells and rat goblet cells at two concentrations of histamine (10-5and 10-6M,Figure 4A, B and C). RvD1 and AT-RvD1 blocked histamine-stimulated secretion a maximum of 78.1 +/- 9.0 and 90.3 +/- 18.6%, respectively in human goblet cells and 76.9 +/- 15.1 and 83.0 +/- 9.3% respectively in rat goblet cells. RvD1 and AT-RvD1 blocked histamine-stimulated increase in [Ca2+]i, ERK1/2 activity, and high molecular weight glycoconjugate including MUC5AC secretion in both human and rat conjunctival goblet cells. RvD1 activates its receptor GPR32None, which is present in human and rat conjunctival goblet cellsNone, and also can activate the lipoxin A4receptor (ALX/FPR2)None. We tested whether RvD1 and AT-RvD1 themselves alter secretion, [Ca2+]i, and ERK1/2 in conjunctival goblet cells. RvD1 and AT-RvD1 each increased goblet cell secretion in both human (Figure 5A) and rat cells (Figure 5C). A maximum action was recorded at 10-9M RvD1 and AT-RvD1 in human cells and 10-9M RvD1 and 10-10M AT-RvD1 in rat cells. The secretory effect of the D-series resolvins was significantly less than that stimulated by histamine at 10-5M which was 2.2 +/- 0.2 fold above basal (not shown). RvD1 and AT-RvD1 caused a maximum stimulation at 1 h in both human and rat cells, which was shorter than histamine, which caused its maximum response at 2 h of stimulationNone(Figure 5B and D). RvD1 and AT-RvD1 increased the peak [Ca2+]iin a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 6A and B) with a maximum increase obtained with 10-9M RvD1 and 10-8M AT-RvD1. In the same experiments histamine increased [Ca2+]ito a higher level elevating it by 220.0 +/- 49.0 nM. To determine the cellular Ca2+pool used by RvD1 and AT-RvD1, extracellular Ca2+was omitted before stimulation with the resolvins. In the absence of extracellular Ca2+, RvD1 stimulated increase in [Ca2+]iwas partially decreased, but the increase stimulated by AT-RvD1 was completely blocked (Figure 6C). The role of the intracellular capacitative Ca2+pool was investigated using thapsigargin in the absence and presence of extracellular Ca2+. Independent of the presence of extracellular Ca2+, when thapsigargin was added first, the increase in [Ca2+]iby the subsequent addition of RvD1 was not altered (Figure 6D). When RvD1 was added first, the thapsigargin-induced Ca2+response was also not altered. Similar results were obtained when AT-RvD1 was used (Figure 6E). Thus neither RvD1 nor AT-RvD1 appear to use the IP3sensitive capacitative Ca2+pool. As RvD1 and AT-RVD1 can also activate the ALX/FPR2 receptorNone, we determined the role that the ALX receptor plays in RvD1 and AT-RvD1 stimulated [Ca2+]iresponse in rat conjunctival goblet cells. In cells in which the ALX/FPR2 receptor was knocked down with siRNA, the [Ca2+]iover time in response to RvD1 (Figure 6F), AT-RvD1 (Figure 6G), or, as a control lipoxin A4(data not shown) was abolished. Peak [Ca2+]iresponse was decreased significantly decreased with all three compounds (Figure 6H). The [Ca2+]iresponse was unchanged when cells were incubated with either a scrambled siRNA or the transfection reagent alone (Figure 6F-H). In rat goblet cells, RvD1 and AT-RvD1 each activate the ALX/FPR2 receptor. When ERK1/2 activity was studied, both RvD1 and AT-RvD1 stimulated ERK1/2 activity in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. A maximum increase in ERK1/2 activity was not reached even at 10-8M RvD1 or AT-RvD1 (Figure 7A and B). A maximum increase in time was detected at 20 min of resolvin stimulation. The resolvins were slower at activating ERK1/2 than histamine whose maximum stimulation was obtained at 5 min (Figure 7C and D). Both RvD1 and AT-RvD1 themselves caused goblet cell secretion, elevation in [Ca2+]i, and increase in ERK1/2 activity. As all four histamine receptors (H1-H4) are activated by histamine in conjunctival goblet cellsNone, we focused on the H1receptor to determine if RvD1 uses its receptor GPR32 to alter the action of histamine. Using fluorescence microscopy, we examined the location of the histamine H1receptors and the DRV1-GPR32 receptor in human goblet cells. Both receptors displayed a punctate pattern of localization (Figure 8A and B). They were detected in the same cells and their immunofluorescence location overlapped (Figure 8C). To determine if RvD1 used its receptor GPR32 to block histamine stimulated [Ca2+]i, we transfected CHO cells with DRV1-GPR32 alone, the H1histamine receptor alone, both receptors, or mock transfection. Cells were stimulated with histamine, RvD1, or RvD1 followed by histamine. When both the H1and GPR32 receptors were transfected, histamine increased [Ca2+]i, (Figure 9A) and RvD1 blocked histamine stimulation. RvD1 did not alter [Ca2+]i. When only the H1receptor was transfected, histamine increased [Ca2+]iand prior exposure to RvD1 did not alter this response (Figure 9B). When only the GPR32 receptor was transfected, no combination of histamine or RvD1 increased the [Ca2+]i(Figure 9C). In mock transfected cells neither histamine nor RvD1 increased [Ca2+]iand the RvD1 treatment did not alter the histamine response (Figure 9D). Together these results suggest that RvD1 uses its receptor DRV1-GPR32 to block the effect of histamine on [Ca2+]i. As a control, cells were also stimulated with RvE1 or RvE1 followed by histamine in CHO cells transfected with both H1 receptor and DRV1-GPR32. RvE1 alone had no effect on [Ca2+]iand RvE1 followed by histamine did not have an effect on histamine-stimulated [Ca2+]i(Figure 9E). Results using transfected CHO cells suggested that RvD1 and AT-RvD1 blocked the histamine-stimulated response at a step before the release of intracellular Ca2+and thus a potential mechanism of action for RvD1 is to counterregulate the histamine receptor. Examination of the phosphorylation sites of the H1receptor using Scan Site (http://scansite.mit.edu/motifscan_id.phtml) and the kinases that phosphorylate the H1receptor using Phospho.ELM (http://phospho.elm.eu.org/pELMBlastSearch.html) indicates potential PKC and betaARK1 (also known as GRK2) phosphorylation sites. CHO cells transfected with the human H1and GPR32 receptors were stimulated with histamine; RvD1 followed by histamine; or the PKC inhibitor calphostin C (Figure 10A) or the betaARK1inhibitory peptide (Figure 10B) followed either by histamine or RvD1 and then histamine. RvD1 blocked the histamine-induced Ca2+response. Calphostin C and betaARK1 both reversed the inhibitory effect of RvD1 on the histamine Ca2+iresponse. Neither calphostin C nor betaARK1 alone blocked the histamine receptor response. In rat goblet cells, both the PKC inhibitor Ro-317549 (Figure 10C) and betaARK1 inhibitory peptide (Figure 10D) blocked the RvD1 inhibition of histamine dimaleate, a specific agonist for the H1 histamine receptor. These data indicate that RvD1 uses PKC and betaARK1 to counterregulate the H1receptor. The inhibitory actions of both RvD1 and AT-RvD1 on the histamine-induced increase in [Ca2+]iin cultured conjunctival goblet cells was compared with that of the H1antagonist chlorpheniramine (Figure 11A). Maximally effective concentrations of the three inhibitors each blocked the histamine-stimulated increase in [Ca2+]ito essentially the same extent (Figure 11B). Our results demonstrate that histamine uses its receptors to increase [Ca2+]i, activate ERK1/2, and stimulate secretion. RvD1 blocks the effects of histamine by interacting with its receptor GPR32 to counterregulate the histamine receptor to prevent the release of intracellular Ca2+and the activation of ERK1/2 thus inhibiting secretion. RvD1 must be added before histamine in order to prevent the release of the intracellular Ca2+store. AT-RvD1 has similar effects in conjunctival goblet cells as RvD1. Previous studies have demonstrated that RvD1 and AT-RvD1 block inflammatory processes in a variety of tissues, but the cellular mechanism of this inhibition has not been demonstrated. Here we show that these resolvins prevent the increase in Ca2+and activation of ERK1/2 used by histamine and its H1receptor subtype to induce goblet cell secretion by activating PKC and betaARK1 to counterregulate the histamine receptor. RvD1 is known to interact with its receptor DRV1-GPR32. Here, we show that there is cross-talk between human GPR32 and the H1receptor. Use of GPR32 is required for the inhibitory actions of RvD1 on the signaling pathway activated by another GPCR the H1receptor activated by histamine. In rat goblet cells, use of the ALX/FPR2 receptor by RvD1 also activates PKC and betaARK1 to counter regulate the H1 receptor. As Ca2+is major mechanism by which histamine evokes it's response, the actions of the D-series resolvins RvD1 and AT-RvD1 on blocking the action of histamine could prevent allergic or inflammatory responses in any tissue in which histamine receptors are located. These tissues include the lung, skin, immune cells, smooth muscle, blood vessels, glands, and nerves. The actions of the D-series resolvins on goblet cell functions are complex as a short-term incubation with the resolvins results in significant activation of ERK 1/2. This activity is short lived however, as 30 min after addition of the resolvins the ERK 1/2 activity has returned to basal levels. In this study, goblet cells were exposed to D-series resolvins for 30 min prior to addition of histamine. Thus resolvins counterregulate the histamine receptors to prevent activation of ERK 1/2. E-series and D-series resolvins are effective in blocking different types of inflammatory responses in the ocular surface. The E-series resolvin RvE1 can reverse inflammation in the cornea by blocking corneal hemangiogenesis activated in a suture or pellet implanted into the mouse corneaNone. RvE1 induces corneal epithelial cell migration and attenuates herpes simplex induced ocular inflammation, as well as corneal epithelial barrier disruption and goblet cell loss in a murine model of dry eyeNone,NoneNone. RvE1 also stimulates tear production and decreases inflammation in a mouse model of dry eyeNoneand in humans in phase 1 and 2 clinical trial reduces the signs and symptoms of dry eye syndrome (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT00799552). The D-series resolvin RvD1 blocks corneal hemangiogenesisNoneand previously we demonstrated that RvD1 blocks cholinergic agonist and leukotriene stimulation of conjunctival goblet cell secretion. The present results demonstrate that RvD1 blocks histamine responses and provides a novel function for resolvins in termination of allergic inflammation. Our findings demonstrate a new use for resolvins as endogenous mediators that could be used to prevent the actions of histamine to treat allergic responses including allergic conjunctivitis in both the mild and severe forms. In the eye, nose, and lung, steroids are the mainstay of regulating inflammation, but their use carries the major side effect of ocular hypertension and glaucomaNone,None. Resolvins are not immunosuppressant, unlike steroids or other anti-inflammatory agents currently used in the eye. Resolvin D1 control of histamine stimulated responses could represent a novel approach with local anti-inflammatory and pro-resolution mediators to treat allergic conjunctivitis and allergies in other susceptible tissues such as lung and skin. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (Taconic Farms, Germantown, NY) weighing between 125 and 150 g were anesthetized with CO2for 1 min, decapitated, and the bulbar and forniceal conjunctival membranes removed from both eyes. All experiments were approved by the Schepens Eye Research Institute Animal Care and Use Committee. Human conjunctival tissue was obtained from Heartland Lions Eye Bank (Kansas City, MO). Tissue was placed in Optisol media within 6 hours of death. Goblet cells from rat and human conjunctiva were grown in organ culture as described previouslyNone,None. The tissue plug was removed after nodules of cells were observed. First passage goblet cells were used in all experiments. Cultured cells were periodically checked by evaluating staining with antibody to cytokeratin 7 (detects goblet cell bodies) and the lectin Ulex europaeus agglutinin (UEA)-1 (detects goblet cell secretory product) to ensure that goblet cells predominated. Goblet cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 degrees C with Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer with HEPES (KRB-HEPES) (119 mM NaCl, 4.8 mM KCl, 1.0 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM MgSO4, 1.2 mM KH2PO4, 25 mM NaHCO3, 10 mM HEPES, and 5.5 mM glucose (pH 7.45) plus 0.5% BSA containing 0.5 muM fura-2/AM (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY), 8 muM pluronic acid F127, and 250 muM sulfinpyrazone followed by washing in KRB-HEPES containing sulfinpyrazone. Calcium measurements were made with a ratio imaging system (In Cyt Im2; Intracellular Imaging, Cincinnati, OH) using wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm and an emission wavelength of 505 nm. At least 10 cells were selected in each experimental condition, and experiments were repeated in at least 3 separate animals. RvD1 or AT-RvD1 (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) were added 30 min before histamine (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Calphostin C, Ro-317549, beta-adrenergic receptor kinase 1 (betaARK1) inhibitor, and H89 (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA) were added 15 min prior to addition of RvD1. After addition of agonists data were collected in real time. Data are presented as the actual [Ca2+]iwith time or as the change in peak [Ca2+]i. Change in peak [Ca2+]iwas calculated by subtracting the average of the basal value (no added agonist) from the peak [Ca2+]i. Although data is not shown, the plateau [Ca2+]iwas affected similarly to the peak [Ca2+]i. Synthetic resolvins at 10 mug/mul (dissolved in ethanol as purchased from the manufacturer) were stored at -80 degrees C with minimal exposure to light. Immediately prior to use, the resolvins were diluted in KRB-HEPES buffer to the desired concentrations and added to the cells. The cells were then incubated at 37 degrees C in the dark. Daily working stock dilutions were discarded following each experiment. Concentrations were confirmed and the resolvin structures validated using LC-MS-MS and were consistent with reported characteristicsNone. Cultured goblet cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of histamine, RvD1, or AT-RvD1. Cells were also incubated with histamine 10-5M for 0-10 min or RvD1 (10-9M) or AT-RvD1 (10-9M) for 0-30 min. In additional experiments, cells were preincubated with increasing concentrations of RvD1 or AT-RvD1 for 30 min prior to addition of histamine (10-5M). Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 150 mM NaCl, 1% deoxycholic acid, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, and 1 mM EDTA) in the presence of a protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The homogenate was centrifuged at 2000g for 30 min at 4 degrees C. Proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and processed for western blotting. Primary antibodies used were phosphorylated (active) ERK 1/2 or total ERK 2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), diluted 1:1000. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence method. The films were analyzed with Image J software (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/). ERK activation was expressed as fold increase over basal that was set to 1. Cultured goblet cells were serum starved for 2 h before use, preincubated with RvD1 or AT-RvD1 for 30 min, and then stimulated with histamine in serum-free RPMI 1640 supplemented with 0.5% BSA for 0-4 h. Goblet cell secretion was measured using an enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA) with the lectin UEA-I. UEA-1 detects high molecular weight glycoconjugates including mucins produced by rat goblet cells. The media were collected and analyzed for the amount of lectin-detectable glycoconjugates, which quantifies the amount of goblet cell secretion as described earlierNone. Glycoconjugate secretion was expressed as fold increase over basal that was set to 1. First passage cells were grown on glass cover slips and fixed in methanol. Both anti-GPR32 (Gene Tex, Irvine, CA) and anti-H1receptor antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) were used at 1:100 dilution overnight at 4 degrees C. Secondary antibodies were conjugated to either Cy2 or Cy 3 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) and were used at a dilution of 1:150 for 1.5 h at room temperature. Negative control experiments included incubation with the isotype control antibody. The cells were viewed by fluorescence microscopy (Eclipse E80i; Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) and micrographs were taken with a digital camera (Spot; Diagnostic Instruments, Inc, Sterling Heights, MI). CHO cells (1*106cells) were transfected with mock (pcDNA3), human H1 (NM_000861.2; OriGene, Rockville, MD), or human GPR32 receptors (O75388;None) using FuGENE transfection reagent (Promega, Madison, WI) following manufacturer's instruction. At 48 hours post transfection, cells were harvested for calcium mobilization experiments. Goblet cells incubated with 100 muM siRNA against a scrambled sequence or ALX receptor for 72 h (ThermoScientific, Waltham, MA) in Accell delivery media according to manufacturer's instructions (ThermoScientific, Waltham, MA). The siRNA was a pool of 4 molecules whose sequences were: 1) CCAUCAGGUUCGUUAUUGG 2) CCUGCAGACAUUGAGAUAA 3) GUUUAAUACUCGUUACGGA and 4) GUACAAACACUUGUGAAA. Results were expressed as the fold-increase above basal. Results are presented as mean +/- SEM. Data were analyzed by Student'st-test. P less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
