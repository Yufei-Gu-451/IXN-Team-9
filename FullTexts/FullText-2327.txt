Nonehave demonstrated that the AFB1-FAPY adduct equilibrates between two species, one of which is mutagenic whereas the other blocks DNA replication. These are alpha and beta deoxyribose anomers. NoneIn duplex DNA, the beta anomer is favored, but in single-strand DNA, the equilibrium shifts to favor the alpha anomer. NoneAt the nucleoside level, the AFB1-FAPY adduct exhibits atropisomerism about the C5-N5bond. NoneThis has not been observed in duplex DNA, probably because both deoxyribose anomers of the adduct intercalate with the AFB1moiety on the 5' face of the adducted nucleotide,None-Nonesimilar to theN7-dG cationic adduct. None,None,None,NoneThis enforces theRaaxial conformation for the C5-N5bond. None-NoneAdditionally, the AFB1-FAPY adduct exhibits geometrical isomerism involving the formamide moiety. NoneIn the 5'-XA-3' sequence,None-Nonethe potential for a hydrogen bond between the formyl oxygen and theN6exocyclic amino group of the 3'-neighbor adenine has been recognized, and this has been proposed to explain the preference of theEisomer as opposed to theZisomer of the formamide moiety. None,NoneThis suggests that the orientation of the formamide moiety is controlled by differential hydrogen bonding opportunities in the DNA major groove, and the equilibrium betweenEandZisomers of the formamide moiety is sequence dependent. To characterize how DNA sequence modulates the conformation of the AFB1-FAPY formamide moiety, four oligodeoxynucleotide duplexes containing the 5'-XA-3', 5'-XC-3', 5'-XT-3', and 5'-XY-3' sequences (X-AFB1-FAPY; Y = 7-deaza-dG) (Chart1) have been constructed, in which the 3'-neighbor base with respect to the adducted guanine has been changed from adenine to thymine, cytosine, and 7-deaza-dG. NMR analyses demonstrate that the equilibrium betweenEandZisomers of the formamide moiety is controlled by major groove hydrogen bonding interactions. When the 3' neighbor is adenine, theEisomer is favored. A mixture ofEandZisomers coexists when the 3' neighbor is cytosine. The major isomer is theEisomer. In contrast, when the 3' neighbor is either thymine or 7-deaza-dG, theZisomer predominates. Structures of each of these duplexes have been refined from NMR data using molecular dynamics calculations restrained by NOE distances. NoneNone(A) The 5'-XA-3' duplex. (B) The 5'-XT-3' duplex.

Unadducted oligodeoxynucleotides were purchased from the Midland Certified Reagent Co. (Midland, TX). AFB1was purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. (Milwaukee, WI). AFB1-exo-8,9-epoxide was prepared by oxidizing AFB1in the presence of dimethyldioxirane,None-Noneas described. NoneCrystalline AFB1is hazardous due to its electrostatic nature and should be handled using appropriate containment procedures and respiratory mask to prevent inhalation. AFB1can be destroyed by treatment with NaOCl. It should be assumed that AFB1-exo-8,9-epoxide is toxic and carcinogenic. Manipulations should be carried out in a well-ventilated hood with suitable containment procedures. The oligodeoxynucleotide 5'-d(CTAAGATTCA)-3', containing the targetedN7-dG alkylation site (underlined) was annealed with 5'-d(ATCTT)-3' to form a partially double-stranded scaffold in 200 muL of 100 mM Na2HPO4(pH 6.5). AFB1-exo-8,9-epoxide was added in 200 muL of CH2Cl2. The biphasic mixture was stirred for 15 min at 5 degrees C. The aqueous phase was dissolved in 100 mM Na2CO3(pH 10) for 2 h at room temperature to form the AFB1-FAPY adduct. The oligodeoxynucleotide containing the AFB1-FAPY adduct 5'-d(CTAAXATTCA)-3' (X = AFB1-FAPY) was recovered from the aqueous phase using reverse-phase HPLC (Gemini C18 250 mm * 10 mm column, Phenomenix, Inc., Torrance, CA) at a flow rate of 2 mL/min, with a linear 30 min gradient of 5-30% CH3CN in 0.1 M ammonium formate (pH 6.5). The eluent was monitored by UV absorbance at 260 and 360 nm. The adducted oligodexoynucleotide was lyophilized and characterized by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The oligodeoxynucleotides 5'-d(CTAAXCTTCA)-3', 5'-d(CTAAXTTTCA)-3', and 5'-d(CTAAXYTTCA)-3' (Y = 7-deazaG) were synthesized and characterized using the same procedures. Each purified AFB1-FAPY modified oligodeoxynucleotide was annealed at room temperature with the complementary strand in buffer consisting of 10 mM NaH2PO4, 0.1 M NaCl, and 50 muM Na2EDTA (pH 7.0), and the annealed duplex oligodeoxynucleotide was eluted from DNA grade Biogel hydroxylapatite using a gradient of 10-200 mM NaH2PO4(pH 7.0). The modified duplexes were desalted by gel filtration chromatography over Sephadex G-25. The melting temperatures were measured in 10 mM Na2HPO4, 0.1 M NaCl, and 50 muM Na2EDTA (pH 7.0). The strand concentration was 1.6 muM. The temperature was increased at a rate of 1 degrees C/min from 10 to 80 degrees C. Absorbance was measured at 260 nm on a Varian Cary 4E spectrometer. The melting points (Tmvalues) of the unmodified and modified oligodeoxynucleotides were obtained by determining the inflection points of the absorbance vs temperature curves from the first-order derivatives. Spectra were recorded at1H frequencies of 600, 800, and 900 MHz using cryogenic probes (Bruker Biospin, Inc., Billerica, MA). Samples were prepared in D2O, containing 0.1 M NaCl, 10 mM NaH2PO4, and 50 muM Na2EDTA (pH 7.0). The program TOPSPIN (Bruker Biospin, Inc., Billerica, MA) was used for data collection and processing. Chemical shifts were referenced to the chemical shift of the water resonance at the corresponding temperature, with respect to 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonic acid (DSS). HMQC spectraNone,Nonewere recorded with 96 real data in the t1dimension and 1024 real data in the t2dimension. COSY and NOESY spectra were recorded with 512 real data in the t1dimension and 2048 real data in the t2dimension. In the NOESY experiment for exchangeable protons, the samples were prepared in 9:1 H2O:D2O and the water signal was suppressed by using the WATERGATE pulse sequence. NoneResonance assignment and peak integration were performed using the program SPARKY. NoneFootprints were drawn around the NOE cross-peaks obtained at NOESY mixing times of 150, 200, and 250 ms using the program SPARKY. Cross-peak intensities were determined by volume integrations. The intensities of the cross-peaks were combined with the intensities generated from complete relaxation matrix analysis of a starting DNA structure to generate a hybrid intensity matrix. None,NoneThe program MARDIGRAS,None-Noneusing the RANDMARDINone,Nonealgorithm, was used to refine the hybrid matrix by iteration between the calculated and experimental NOE intensities. The calculations were initiated using isotropic correlation times of 2, 3, and 4 ns. Analysis of this data yielded experimental distance restraints used in molecular dynamics calculations. Restrained molecular dynamics (rMD) calculations for the oligodeoxynucleotide duplexes utilized a simulated annealing approach. NoneThe AFB1-FAPY modified oligonucleotides were constructed using the BUILDER module of INSIGHT II (Accelrys, Inc., San Diego, CA). The partial charges on the AFB1-FAPY nucleotide were obtained from density function theory (DFT) calculations using a neutral total charge, utilizing the B3LYP/6-31G* basis set and the program GAUSSIAN. NoneTo obtain the starting structures used for rMD calculations, the AFB1FAPY-modified duplex was energy minimized using 200 iterations with the conjugate gradients algorithm. The rMD calculations were conducted with AMBERNoneusing the parm99Noneforce field. The generalized Born (GB)Nonemodel with parameters developed by Tsui and CaseNonewas used for implicit water simulation. The program CORMANone,Nonewas utilized to calculate the NOE intensities from the structures emergent from rMD calculations. Molecular dynamics simulations in explicit water were performed using the AMBER force field. The average structure converged from the series of simulated annealing rMD calculations was used as the starting structure. This was placed in an truncated octahedral TIP3P water box with periodic boundaries at a distance of 8.0 A from the solute. NoneThe necessary Na+ions were added to neutralize the duplex using restraints having a lower bound of 3.0 A and an upper bound of 8.0 A. The system was subjected to 1000 iterations of potential energy minimization using steepest descents. The solvent was brought to thermal equilibrium by a rMD simulation at constant volume for 10000 iterations with an integrator time of 1 fs, at 300 K. The experimental distance and torsion angle restraints and empirical restraints were increased linearly during the heating. rMD calculations were performed at constant pressure for 1 ns with an integrator time of 1 fs. Bond lengths involving hydrogens were fixed with the SHAKE algorithim. NoneThe particle mesh Ewald (PME) method was used to approximate nonbonded interactions. None,NoneThe cutoff radius for nonbonded interactions was 8.0 A. The PTRAJ programNonefrom the AMBER package was used to analyze the rMD trajectories. The 10-mers 5'-d(CTAAGATTCA)-3', 5'-d(CTAAGCTTCA)-3', 5'-d(CTAAGTTTCA)-3', and 5'-d(CTAAGYTTCA)-3' were designed to contain a single guanine, the targetedN7-dG alkylation site (underlined). These were individually annealed with 5-mers, 5'-d(ATCTT)-3', 5'-d(AACTT)-3', containing a C:A mismatch, 5'-d(AACTT)-3', or 5'-d(ACCTT)-3', respectively, to form double-stranded scaffolds extending two base pairs in either direction from the targetedN7-dG alkylation site. The scaffold facilitated the reaction with AFB1-exo-epoxide, by allowing intercalation above the 5'-face of the targeted guanine, and directing alkylation at theN7-dG position. None,NoneThe resulting 10-mers containingtrans-8,9-dihydro-8-(N7-guanyl)-9-hudroxy-AFB1adductsNonewere separated from the scaffolds using reverse-phase HPLC. Under basic conditions, over a period of several hours, the 10-mers spontaneously rearranged to the corresponding AFB1-FAPY adducts. None-NoneThe utilization of 7-deaza-dG in the 5'-XY-3' sequence directed the alkylation to the single dG; it also facilitated the subsequent isolation of the AFB1-FAPY modified oligodeoxynucleotide using reverse-phase HPLC. The 7-deaza-dG:C base pair was not anticipated to disrupt the helical structure of the duplex. NoneThe 10-mers containing the AFB1-FAPY adducts were characterized by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry: for 5'-XA-3', calcd 3357.1, found 3356.5; for 5'-XC-3', calcd 3333.1, found 3333.2; for 5'-XT-3', calcd 3348.1, found 3348.0; for 5'-XY-3', calcd 3372.1, found 3372.8. For each of the four duplexes, one set of resonances of the X5AFB1moiety was observed. Figure1shows the data for the 5'-XC-3' duplex. Figures S1, S2, and S3 in the Supporting Informationshow the corresponding spectra for the 5'-XA-3', 5'-XT-3', and 5'-XY-3' duplexes. The AFB1H5, H6a, H8, H9, H9a, and -OCH3resonances were assigned similar to previous studies, consistent with the notion that in each instance, the AFB1moiety was intercalated above the 5'-face of the modified guanine and the each adduct maintained a similarRaaxial conformation for the C5-N5bond linking the pyrimidine ring to the formamido nitrogen. None,None,NoneThe assignments of the AFB1protons are tabulated inTables S1-S4 of the Supporting Information. NOESY spectrum showing the assignments of the AFB1protons of the 5'-XC-3' duplex. The cross peaks are assigned as (a) X5AFB1OCH3- greater than X5AFB1H5; (b) X5AFB1H9a - greater than X5AFB1CHO; (c) X5AFB1H9a - greater than X5AFB1H6a; (d) X5AFB1H9a - greater than X5AFB1H9; (e) X5AFB1H9 - greater than X5AFB1CHO; (f) X5AFB1H9 - greater than X5AFB1H6a; (g) X5AFB1H8 - greater than X5AFB1CHO, (h) X5AFB1H8 - greater than X5AFB1H6a, (i) X5AFB1H8 - greater than X5AFB1H9, (j) X5AFB1H5 - greater than X5AFB1H6a, (k) X5AFB1H6a - greater than X5AFB1CHO. The 900 MHz spectrum with a mixing time of 250 ms was collected at 283 K. Corresponding spectra for the 5'-XA-3', 5'-XT-3', and 5'-XY-3' duplexes may be found inFigures S1, S2, and S3 of the Supporting Information. A series of HMQC spectraNone,Noneallowed the characterization of theE:Zequilibrium of the AFB1-FAPY formyl group in the 5'-XA-3', 5'-XC-3', 5'-XT-3', and 5'-XY-3' duplexes (Figure2). For the 5'-XA-3' duplex, the carbonyl13C resonance was observed at 171 ppm, coupled to a proton resonance at 8.43 ppm. This resonance was assigned to theEgeometrical isomer of the formyl group. For the 5'-XC-3' duplex, two cross-peaks were observed in this region of the HMQC spectrum, suggesting that for this duplex, two species were present in equilibrium. One13C carbonyl resonance at 167 ppm was coupled to a proton resonance at 8.33 ppm. The other13C carbonyl resonance at 168 ppm was coupled to a proton resonance at 7.47 ppm, assigned as theZisomer of the formyl group. For the 5'-XT-3' duplex, the carbonyl13C resonance was observed at 168 ppm, coupled to a proton resonance at 7.71 ppm. For the 5'-XY-3' duplex, the carbonyl13C resonance was observed at 169 ppm, coupled to a proton resonance at 7.71 ppm. For each of the four duplexes, the assignments of the formyl proton resonances were supported by NOEs to the deoxyribose H1' and AFB1H6a protons. Additionally, different NOEs were observed between the formyl protons and AFB1H8. For the 5'-XA-3' and the major isomer of the 5'-XC-3' duplexes, strong NOEs were observed between the X5formyl protons and the AFB1H8 proton, which were observed at delta 8.3 ppm and delta 5.7 ppm, respectively. For the 5'-XT-3' and 5'-XY-3' duplexes, weak NOEs were observed between the X5formyl protons and the AFB1H8 protons, which were observed at delta 7.7 ppm and delta 6.1 ppm, respectively. NMR analysis of the formyl group proton resonances for the four AFB1-FAPY modified duplexes.

(C) The 5'-XT-3' duplex. (D) The 5'-XY-3' duplex. The HMQC spectra were collected at 283 K at a1H frequency of 600 MHz. NMR spectra of the nonexchangeable protons of the AFB1-FAPY modified 5'-XA-3', 5'-XC-3', 5'-XT-3', and 5'-XY-3' duplexes were assigned using the sequential NOE connectivity of the base proton H6 or H8 dipolar couplings with H1' deoxyribose protons. None,NoneFor each of the duplexes, the deoxyribose spin systems were assigned from the assignments of the H1' protons. The assignments of the deoxyribose H2' and H2" resonances were determined from the relative cross peak intensities in the NOESY spectrum between the H2' and H2" resonances and the H3' resonances. These measurements were obtained at a NOE mixing time of 60 ms, which minimized spin diffusion. The anomeric configurations at X5C1' were determined by analyzing the NOEs between the H2' and H2" protons and the H1' protons. Figure3shows the results for theEandZgeometrical isomers of 5'-XC-3'duplex. In each instance, the intensity of the X5H1' to X5H2' NOE was less than the X5H1' to X5H2" NOE, confirming the beta configurations of the glycosyl bonds.

(A) TheEisomer. (B) TheZisomer. The 900 MHz NOESY spectrum with a mixing time of 60 ms was collected at 283 K. Corresponding spectra of the 5'-XA-3' and 5'-XT-3' duplexes may be found inFigures S4 and S5 of the Supporting Information. For each of the 5'-XA-3', 5'-XC-3', 5'-XT-3', and 5'-XY-3' duplexes, the resonances of the nucleobase imino protons were assigned on the basis of sequential connectivity between adjacent base pairs in NOESY spectra. These assignments were supported by NOEs to the amino protons of Watson-Crick base pairs. NoneIn each duplex, there was an interruption of the sequential imino-to-imino proton NOEs between the T17N3H proton at base pair A4:T17and the X5N1H proton at base pair X5:C16, consistent with the 5'-intercalation of the AFB1moiety. In each duplex, at the X5:T16base pair, the observation of strong interstrand cross peaks from X5N1H to the C16N4H1 and C16N4H2 amino protons indicated that Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding between X5and C16was intact (Figure4). For the X5N1H imino proton in the 5'-XC-3' duplex, two sets of resonances were observed at 278 K. The ratio between them was 1:2.8. Compared to the unmodified duplex, the C6N4H1 non-hydrogen bonded exocyclic amine proton shifted downfield 0.21 ppm at 278 K (Figure4). The assignments of the exchangeable protons are tabulated inTables S5-S8 of the Supporting Information.

The cross-peaks are assigned as (e) C6H5 - greater than G15N1H; (f) C6N4H1 - greater than G15N1H; (g) C6N4H2 - greater than G15N1H; (h) C16H5 - greater than X5N1H; (i) C16N4H1 - greater than X5N1H; (j) C16N4H2 - greater than X5N1H. The NOESY spectra were collected at 800 MHz with a mixing time of 250 ms. The temperature was 278 K.For each of the 5'-XA-3', 5'-XC-3', 5'-XT-3', and 5'-XY-3' duplexes, in the modified strand, the sequential NOE connectivity between nucleobase purine H8 or pyrimidine H6 protons and deoxyribose H1' protons was observed from C1to A4. In each instance, the sequential connectivity exhibited an interruption between A4H1' and X5due to the loss of the guanine H8 proton because of the opening of the guanine imidazole ring (Figure5). The connectivity resumed starting from an intranucleotide NOE between X5H1' and the formyl proton of the FAPY base and continued to the 3'-terminus. For the complementary strand, in all instances, an interruption of the sequential NOEs was observed between C16H1' and T17H8. For the 5'-XC-3' duplex, two sets of resonances for several protons were observed for the base pairs X5:C16, C6:G15, and T7:A14, in both COSY and NOESY experiments, indicating the existence of two species. The assignments of the nonexchangeable protons are tabulated inTables S9-S12 of the Supporting Information.

(D) The 5'-XY-3' duplex. X = AFB1-FAPY, Y = 7-deaza-dG. The arrows indicate the NOEs between the formyl protons and the AFB1H8 protons. The 900 MHz NOESY spectra with a mixing time of 250 ms were collected at 283 K.For the 5'-GA-3', 5'-GC-3', 5'-GT-3', and 5'-GY-3' unmodified duplexes, theTmvalues, as monitored by UV absorbance at 260 nm, were 31, 37, 32, and 35 degrees C, respectively. The higher values ofTmfor the 5'-GC-3' and 5'-GY-3' duplexes were attributed to the presence of the 3'-neighbor C:G or 7-deaza-dG:C base pairs vs 3'-neighbor A:T or T:A base pairs, respectively. As anticipated,None,None,Nonethe presence of the AFB1-FAPY adducts increased the thermal stabilities of each of the four duplexes. The melting points for the 5'-XA-3', 5'-XC-3', 5'-XT-3', and 5'-XY-3' duplexes were 41, 45, 41, and 45 degrees C, respectively. The higher values ofTmfor the 5'-XC-3' and 5'-XY-3' duplexes were also attributed to the presence of the 3'-neighbor C:G or 7-deaza-dG:C base pairs, respectively. The thermal melting of the 5'-XA-3', 5'-XC-3', 5'-XT-3', and 5'-XY-3' duplexes was also examined by monitoring NMR spectra of the imino protons as a function of temperature; the imino proton resonances were assigned using standard methods. NoneFor each duplex, at the X5:C16base pair the X5N1H imino proton resonance and the 5'-neighbor A4:T17base pair T17N3H imino proton resonance were observed at 40 degrees C (Figure6). Increased stabilization of the 3'-neighbor base pairs was also observed. For the 5'-XA-3' duplex the T15N3H imino proton resonance was observed. For the 5'-XC-3' duplex, the G15N1H imino proton resonance was observed. At 308 K, the ratio between the two isomers changed to 1:2.2 (Figure6). This was also observed in COSY experiments at both temperatures. The additional imino resonances at 308 K were also observed for the G15N1H resonance (Figure6). For the 5'-XY-3' duplex, the Y6N1H imino proton resonance was observed. For the 5'-XY-3' duplex, a single resonance was observed at both 278 and 308 K for the X5N1H imino proton (Figure6). For the 5'-XC-3' duplex, the presence of two species in equilibrium was evident, with doubling of the imino proton resonances being observed for the X5:C16and 3'-neighboring C6:G15base pairs. The imino proton resonance for the 5'-neighbor A4:T17base pair exhibited line broadening. The ratio of the two species was approximately 3:1 at 10 degrees C, decreasing to 2:1 at 40 degrees C. Both species exhibited similar overallTmvalues. NMR spectra showing the Watson-Crick base paired imino proton region for the four AFB1-FAPY modified duplexes as a function of temperature.

The arrows indicate imino proton resonances assigned to theZgeometrical isomers in equilibrium with theEisomers for the 5'-XA-3' and 5'-XC-3' duplexes. X = AFB1-FAPY, Y = 7-deaza-dG. The spectra were collected at a1H frequency of 800 MHz. For each of the 5'-XA-3', 5'-XC-3', 5'-XT-3', and 5'-XY-3' duplexes, the protons of the two AFB1-fused furan rings showed NOEs to major groove and imino protons of the DNA; most of these were to the 5' neighboring base-pair A4:T17. Thus, H6a and H9a, which are located on the same face of the AFB1moiety, both exhibited NOEs to A4H8. A weaker NOE was observed for AFB1H9. The AFB1H5 and -OCH3protons exhibited NOEs with minor groove and imino DNA protons. These were primarily to base A4:T17in the 5' direction and to the modified nucleotide X5. These included NOEs between AFB1-OCH3and A4H1', A4H2', A4H2", A4H2, T17N3H, X5H1', and X5N1H. The cyclopentenone ring H2alpha and H2beta produced NOEs with C16H1', H2', and H2", and T17H1', and H3' of the complementary strand. A series of rMD calculations, using a simulated annealing protocol, were performed from initial A- and B-form DNA starting structures for each of the AFB1-FAPY modified duplexes. For the 5'-XC-3' duplex, only the structure of theEisomer was refined; theZisomer did not exhibit sufficient NOE cross-peaks to allow structural refinement. Emergent structures, five each from A- and B-DNA starting structures, with lowest energies, were obtained for each duplex and subjected to potential energy minimization. For each duplex, all structures converged as indicated by pairwise rmsd comparisons (Table1, andFigures S6, S7, S8, and S9 in the Supporting Information). The accuracies of the emergent structures were evaluated by comparison of theoretical NOE intensities calculated by CORMANonefor the refined structure to the experimental NOE intensities to yield sixth root residuals (R1None). NoneTheR1Nonevalues for overall residuals, as well as the residuals for intra- or internucleotide NOEs, were consistently less than 0.1 (Table1) and for each nucleotide were less than 0.15, suggesting that the refined structures for each duplex were in good agreement with the NOESY data. Figures S10, S11, S12, and S13 in the Supporting Informationshow theR1Nonevalues for individual nucleotides. Expanded views of the structures are shown in Figure7. In each instance, the AFB1moiety intercalated above the 5'-face of the modified nucleotide X5and between base pairs A4:T17and X5:C16, causing the rise between these base pairs to increase to 7 A. The adduct-induced unwinding was localized to the adducted base pairs X5:C16and their 5'- and 3'-neighbor base pairs A4:T17and A6:T15. The modified duplexes were each unwound approximately 15 degrees at the adducted sites. For the 5'-XA-3' duplex, the A6N6H1 non-Watson-Crick hydrogen bonded exocyclic amine proton was within hydrogen bonding distance of the X5formyl oxygen; this positioned the formamide moiety in theEconfiguration. For the 5'-XC-3' duplex, only the structure of theEisomer was refined; theZisomer did not exhibit sufficient NOE cross-peaks to allow structural refinement. The C6N4H1 non-Watson-Crick hydrogen bonded exocyclic amine proton was within hydrogen bonding distance of the X5formyl oxygen; this positioned the formamide in theEconfiguration. The structure of the 5'-XT-3' duplex positioned the formamide in theZconfiguration. The structure suggested that the X5formyl oxygen was within hydrogen bonding distance of the X5N9H exocyclic amine proton. Refined structures of the four AFB1-FAPY modified duplexes.

For each of the 5'-XA-3', 5'-XC-3', 5'-XT-3', and 5'-XY-3' duplexes, 1 ns of equilibrium rMD calculation was performed in explicit water at constant pressure at 300 K to examine the dynamics of the refined structure and to analyze hydrogen bond occupancies involving the formyl oxygen atom of the AFB1-FAPY adduct. The 1 ns rMD trajectory was analyzed for occupancies of hydrogen bonding motifs. Hydrogen bond occupancies were calculated using a distance cutoff of 3.5 A and an angle cutoff of 120 degrees . Using these criteria, for the 5'-XA-3' duplex, the hydrogen bond between the formyl oxygen and the A6N6-dA exocyclic amino group was satisfied for greater than 95% of the trajectory. Using the same criteria, for theEconfiguration of the 5'-XC-3' duplex, this hydrogen bond was satisfied for 93% of the trajectory. In contrast, using these criteria, for the 5'-XT-3', and 5'-XY-3' duplexes the rMD trajectories in explicit solvent suggested that the X5formyl oxygen was within hydrogen bonding distance of the X5N9H exocyclic amine proton; this positioned the formamide in theZconfiguration. This orientation was satisfied for approximately 75% of the trajectory for both the 5'-XT-3', and 5'-XY-3' duplexes. The structural coordinates for the 5'-XA-3' duplex, theEisomer of the 5'-XC-3' duplex, the 5'-XT-3' duplex, and the 5'-XY-3' duplex have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank. PDB ID codes: 2MMF for the 5'-XA-3' duplex, 2MMR for theEisomer of the 5'-XC-3' duplex, 2MMQ for the 5'-XT-3' duplex, and 2MMS for the 5'-XY-3' duplex. The structures of AFB1-FAPY adducts in DNANone-Noneand in template:primer complexes with DNA damage bypass polymerasesNoneare of interest due to their potential to equilibrate between alpha and beta deoxyribose anomers, atropisomers of the C5-N5bond linking the pyrimidine ring to the formamide nitrogen, and geometrical isomers of the formamide moiety. NoneIn duplex DNA, in differing sequence contexts, these equilibria are anticipated to modulate the biological processing and genotoxicity of AFB1-FAPY adducts. The AFB1-FAPY adductNone,Nonemay be linked to site-specific G - greater than T transversions in the tumor suppression gene p53None-Noneandrasproto-oncogenes. NoneIn the 5'-XA-3' duplex, theEconfiguration of the formamide group (Figure2) allows formation of a hydrogen bond between the formyl oxygen of the AFB1-FAPY adduct and theN6-dA non-Watson-Crick hydrogen bonded exocyclic amino proton of the 3'-neighbor A6(Figure7). Several features of the NMR spectrum provide evidence for the existence of this hydrogen bond, which had been predicted from studies by Mao et al. Noneand Brown et al. NoneThe downfield chemical shifts of the formyl proton (Figure2) and the A6non-Watson-Crick exocyclic amino proton (Figure4) are consistent with the electronic deshielding of both protons. The appearance of an additional NMR resonance at 308 K, assigned to theZconfiguration (Figure6), suggests that theZconfiguration is favored in the absence of a thermally stable DNA duplex, as is observed at the nucleoside level. NoneThe slow interconversion ofEandZisomers (Figure6) is consistent with a significant lifetime for this hydrogen bond on the NMR time scale. It suggests that the interconversion between the two configurations within the major groove is sterically hindered in duplex DNA. In support of this conclusion, the rMD trajectories calculated in the presence of explicit solvent over a 1 ns time period predict a significant occupancy of this hydrogen bond. In the 5'-XC-3' duplex, a mixture ofEandZisomers is observed (Figure2). The intensity of the NOE between the formyl proton and AFB1H8 proton establishes the major isomer as theEconfiguration (Figure5). This allows for the formation of a hydrogen bond between the formyl oxygen and the C6N4-dC non-Watson-Crick amino proton (Figure7). In the refined structure, the distance between the formyl oxygen and C6N4H1 is 2.7 A, and the calculated angle O...H--N is 110 degrees (Figure7). As compared to the 5'-XA-3' duplex, the C6N4-dC non-Watson-Crick amino proton is less deshielded in the 5'-XC-3' duplex (Figure4). This suggests a weaker hydrogen bond, as compared to the 5'-XA-3' duplex. The coexistence of alpha and beta anomers is ruled out by comparison of the NOEs intensities between the X5H1' to X5H2' and H2", which indicates that bothEandZgeometrical isomers maintain the beta configuration of the deoxyribose (Figure3). Moreover, only one set of NMR resonances is observed for the X5AFB1moiety (Figure1) and the coexistence of both alpha and beta anomers would have been predicted to result in distinguishable subspectra for each isomer. NoneSimilar to the 5-XA-3' duplex, as the temperature is increased from 278 to 308 K, the equilibrium shifts toward theZisomer (Figure6). This again suggests that theZconfiguration is favored in single-strand DNA,Nonebut that in duplex DNA, the major groove hydrogen bonding favors theEconfiguration. As for the 5-XA-3' duplex, slow interconversion ofEandZisomers (Figure6) suggests a significant lifetime for this hydrogen bond and that interconversion between the two geometrical isomers within the major groove is hindered in duplex DNA. The rMD trajectories calculated in the presence of explicit solvent over a 1 ns time period are consistent with this conclusion and predict significant occupancy of this hydrogen bond. In the 5'-XT-3' and 5'-XY-3' duplexes, there is no 3'-neighbor exocyclic amino proton in the major groove for either T or 7-deaza-dG, so a major groove hydrogen bond cannot form. Consequently, the formamide moiety favors theZgeometrical isomer (Figure2), as is observed at the nucleoside level. NoneFor both duplexes, the preference of theZisomer is confirmed by the less intense NOE between the formyl proton and AFB1H8 proton, as compared to the 5'-XA-3' duplex, indicating a greater distance between the two protons in theZisomer (Figure5). For the 5'-XT-3' duplex, the refined structure predicts that the distance between the formyl oxygen and X5N9H is 3.1 A, and the calculated angle O...H--N is 138 degrees (Figure7). For the 5'-XY-3' duplex, the corresponding predicted distance is 2.7 A and 147 degrees (Figure7). These results suggest that theZisomer could be stabilized by a hydrogen bond between the formyl oxygen of the AFB1-FAPY adduct and the X5N9H exocyclic amine proton. However, the rMD trajectories calculated in explicit solvent are equivocal. They suggest 76% and 81% occupancies for this hydrogen bond in the 5'-XT-3' and 5'-XY-3' duplexes, respectively. The observation of a single NMR resonance for the X5N1H imino proton at both 278 and 308 K for both the 5'-XT-3' and 5'-XY-3' duplexes (Figure6) is consistent with the notion that theZisomer is favored at all temperatures. NoneLikewise, a single resonance is observed for the imino protons of the 3'-neighbors, T6N3H and 7-deaza-dG6N1H in the 5'-XT-3' and 5'-XY-3' duplexes, respectively, at 308 K (Figure6). The significant structural differences between the four AFB1-FAPY adducts studied here, under equilibrium conditions, are with regard to the geometrical isomerization of the formamide moiety in the major groove (Figure7). For each of the four duplexes, only one set of NMR resonances is observed for the X5AFB1moiety (Figure1), which indicates that the equilibrium betweenEandZisomers induces a localized perturbation to the duplex. Spectroscopic differences between theEandZisomers are confined to base pairs X5:C16, C6:G15, and T7:A14, and the modest chemical shift perturbations of corresponding nucleobase and deoxyribose H1' protons of theEandZisomers become smaller proceeding from the modified base pair X5:C16and proceeding in the 3'-direction toward base pairs C6:G15, and T7:A14(Figure5). The equilibria between alpha and beta anomersNoneand the atropisomerism about the C5-N5bondNonedo not exhibit sequence dependence. For all four duplexes, the AFB1moiety intercalates above the 5'-face of the damaged base, theRaaxial conformation about the C5-N5bond is maintained, and the beta anomer of the deoxyribose is favored, similar to studies of the beta anomer of the AFB1-FAPY adduct. None,NoneA study of the alpha anomer of the AFB1-FAPY adductNoneconcluded that the AFB1moiety also intercalates on the 5' face of the damaged base, also maintaining theRaaxial conformation about the C5-N5bond. However, perturbations of the epsilon and zeta backbone torsion angles were observed, and the base stacking of the duplex was perturbed, which correlates with the observation that the alpha anomer of the AFB1-FAPY adduct blocks DNA replication. NoneOne notable feature of the beta anomer of the AFB1-FAPY adduct is its thermal stabilization of the DNA duplex. None,NoneIt has been proposed that hydrogen bonding between the formyl oxygen of the AFB1-FAPY adduct and theN6non-Watson-Crick hydrogen bonded exocyclic amino proton of the 3'-neighbor A6provides a potential contribution to this stabilization,None,Nonebut the present results suggests that this is not the major contributing factor. Although in the 5'-XA-3' and 5'-XT-3' duplexes, the formamide is held inEvsZisomers, the 5'-intercalation of the AFB1moiety stabilizes both 5'-XA-3' and 5'-XT-3' duplexes by a similar 10 degrees C increase inTm, as compared to the unadducted duplexes. A similar increase inTmis observed in the 5'-XY-3' and 5'-XC-3' duplexes. Therefore, it seems that the hydrogen bond between the AFB1formamide moiety and the 3'- neighbor base, an intrastrand hydrogen bond, does not contribute to the stability of the AFB1-FAPY modified DNA duplex. Instead, the thermal stability of the beta anomer of the AFB1-FAPY adduct in duplex DNA is likely attributable to favorable base stacking interactions. None,NoneSequence-dependent hydrogen bonding patterns in the DNA major groove modulateEvsZgeometrical isomerism of the formamide moiety of the AFB1-FAPY adduct. The differential accommodation of these AFB1-FAPY adducts within the active site may, in part, modulate lesion bypass. It will be of interest to determine if sequence-dependent structural perturbations, observed here for DNA duplexes in vitro and at equilibrium, are translated into differential outcomes during error-prone replication bypass of the AFB1-FAPY adduct. Banerjee et al. Nonehave obtained structural data for the error-prone bypass of the AFB1-FAPY adduct by theSulfolobus solfataricusP2 DNA polymerase IV (Dpo4) in the 5'-XA-3' sequence context. The Dpo4 polymerase conducts error-prone replication past the AFB1-FAPY adduct, including misinsertion of dATP, consistent with G - greater than T transversions. None,None-NoneIn the 5'-XA-3' sequence, the structure of a ternary (Dpo4-DNA-dATP) AFB1-FAPY adducted template reveals that the oxygen atom of the FAPY formyl group participates in a water-mediated hydrogen bond with polymerase residue Arg332. NoneIn this case, the AFB1-FAPY formamide group exists as theZgeometrical isomer. NoneThus, geometrical isomerism of the AFB1-FAPY formamide group is modulated not only by DNA sequence but also by specific interactions within the active sites of specific error-prone bypass polymerases. It is also possible that geometrical isomerism of the AFB1-FAPY formamide group modulates the recognition and repair of these adducts in a sequence-specific manner. FAPY-type adducts are often substrates for base excision repair (BER),Nonebut the AFB1-FAPY adduct is a substrate for nucleotide excision repair (NER) in bacterial,Noneyeast,Noneand mammalian cells. None-NoneThese reports are consistent with the notion that NER targets bulky DNA lesions. On the other hand, the AFB1-FAPY lesion thermally stabilizes the DNA duplex. None,NoneSuch thermal stabilization has been associated with resistance to NER. None,NoneAdditionally, the data suggest differences in damage recognition between bacterial and mammalian repair systems. Croy and WoganNonenoted that the AFB1-FAPY lesion is removed less efficiently in mammalian cells than is the initially formed AFB1-N7-dG cationic adduct, whereas both lesions are repaired with equal efficiencies in bacteria. More recently, Alekseyov et al. Noneconfirmed that inEscherichia coliAFB1-FAPY lesions are efficiently repaired by NER. While TakahashiNonehad reported that XPA-deficient mice exhibited enhanced AFB1-induced liver tumorigenesis, Mulder et al. Nonedid not observe increased repair of AFB1-FAPY adducts in lung or liver extracts of NER-compromised heterozygous p53 knockout mice and they also did not observe changes in XPA or XPB protein levels in the p53 knockout mice. Consequently, the precise factors modulating NER recognition and repair of AFB1-FAPY lesions remain incompletely understood. There is precedent for the idea that sequence-specific differences in DNA adduct structure may modulate NER efficiencies. Geacintov, Broyde, and co-workersNone-Nonehave investigated the sequence dependence of NER and have noted the potential for sequence specific differences in steric factors involving the minor groove-aligned PAH adducts and nearby guanine amino groups; they conclude that the NER apparatus binds productively or unproductively to the damaged DNA duplex depending upon the structural and stereochemical properties of specific DNA adducts. NoneThus, it will be of interest to examine DNA sequence modulation of NER for AFB1-FAPY adducts.
