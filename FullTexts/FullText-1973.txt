p73 is a member of the p53 familyNone. While the importance of p53 in tumor suppression is firmly establishedNone,None, p73 plays a complex role in tumorigenesis that is still not well-understoodNone-None. p73 is expressed in two major isoform classes (TAp73 and DeltaNp73) with apparently distinct functionsNone-None(Figure S1A). TAp73 isoforms, similar to p53, contain an N-terminal transactivation domain. TAp73 can activate p53-target genes and induce apoptosis or cell cycle arrest. In contrast, DeltaNp73 lacks the transactivation domain but retains DNA-binding and oligomerization domains. DeltaNp73 is able to exert a dominant negative effect on TAp73, as well as other p53 family members, through the formation of inactive hetero-oligomeric complexes or competition for promoter binding. Unlike p53-deficient mice, which appear developmentally normal but highly prone to spontaneous tumorsNone,None, mice with total p73 loss have profound defects in the immune and nervous systems but no increases in tumor incidenceNone. Though total p73 loss cooperates with p53 loss to further promote tumor formation in a context-dependent mannerNone-None. TAp73-specific knockout mice exhibit partial embryonic lethality, infertility, and a marked increase in spontaneous and carcinogen-induced tumorsNone. These phenotypes are likely due, in part, to genomic instability in the absence of TAp73None,None. In contrast, DeltaNp73 deficiency in mice leads to increased DNA damage signaling and p53-dependent apoptosisNone, indicating a role for DeltaNp73 in the suppression of the p53 response. These observations support a model in which TAp73, like p53, suppresses tumorigenesis, while DeltaNp73 promotes it. Nevertheless, in contrast to p53, which is the most frequently mutated gene in human tumors, TAp73 is rarely mutated in these tumorsNone,None,None. An analysis of ~1,500 human tumors indicated that less than 0.2% harbored a mutant p73 (either isoform class), as opposed to over 50% with a mutant p53None. Instead, TAp73 is frequently over-expressed, along with DeltaNp73, in a wide range of human cancersNone,None. The conspicuous absence of TAp73 mutations and prevalence of TAp73 up-regulation suggest that TAp73 may afford proliferative advantages to tumor cells. The metabolism in tumor cells is dramatically reprogrammed to enable robust biosynthesis and anti-oxidant defenseNone-None. While the generation of macromolecules is an intuitive requirement for tumor cell proliferation, recent evidence also supports the critical importance of ROS detoxification in oncogenic growth. Tumor cells commonly encounter high oxidative stress due to the effect of oncogenic mutations and their microenvironmentNone,None,None. While moderate and transient elevation in ROS is implicated in proliferationNone,None, high and persistent elevation in ROS damages protein, DNA, and other cellular components and poses a continuous threat to the viability of tumor cells. The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is a major glucose metabolic pathway important for meeting the cellular demands of biosynthesis and anti-oxidant defense. It provides cells with ribose-5-phosphate (R5P) forde novosynthesis of RNA and DNA, and with the reducing equivalent NADPH for reductive biosynthesis (e.g., the synthesis of lipids and deoxyriboses) and anti-oxidant defense (Supplementary Fig. S2a). The pacesetter of the PPP is glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), which catalyzes the first committing step of this pathway. Here we investigate TAp73 in cell proliferation and identify a critical role for TAp73 in promoting biosynthesis and anti-oxidant defense via the induction of G6PD expression. To investigate the role of TAp73 in tumor cell proliferation, we used E1A/RasV12-transformed mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (MEFs) with wild-type (+/+) or homozygous disruption of (-/-) TAp73None. Interestingly,TAp73-/-MEF cells lines proliferated significantly slower thanTAp73+/+MEFs (Fig. 1aandSupplementary Fig. S1b). To investigate the role of TAp73 in tumor formation, we injectedTAp73-/-andTAp73+/+MEF cells into immuno-compromised mice. TAp73-/-MEF cells gave rise to much smaller tumors thanTAp73+/+MEF cells did (Fig. 1bandSupplementary Fig. S1c). To extend these analyses to human tumor cells, we stably knocked down TAp73 in human osteosarcoma U2OS cells using small hairpin RNA (shRNA). This significantly reduced proliferation of U2OS cells in culture and their growth in mouse xenograft tumors (Fig. 1c,dandSupplementary Fig. S1d). These observations suggest that TAp73 is required for optimal cell proliferation and tumor formation. For comparison, we also tested the role of DeltaNp73 in tumor cell proliferation using E1A/RasV12-transformed DeltaNp73-/-MEFs and the matched DeltaNp73+/+MEFsNone. We observed that loss of DeltaNp73 resulted in a decrease in cell proliferation (Supplementary Fig. S1e, f), consistent with a role for DeltaNp73 in tumor growthNone. We investigated the mechanism by which TAp73 promotes proliferation. Our recent studies have shown that p53 inhibits the PPPNone. We assessed whether TAp73 has any regulatory effects on the glucose flux through this pathway. TAp73+/+andTAp73-/-MEF cells were cultured in medium containing [2-13C]glucose, and the PPP flux was measured based on the rate of glucose consumption and13C labeling patterns in lactate determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopyNone,None. Of note, TAp73 deficiency reduced the PPP flux by ~50%, while DeltaNp73 deficiency had no effect (Fig. 2a,b), suggesting that TAp73, but not DeltaNp73, enhances the PPP flux. The rate-limiting enzyme of the PPP is G6PD, which catalyzes the conversion of glucose-6-phosphate to 6-phosphate-gluconolactone (Supplementary Fig. S2a)None. We assayed G6PD activity inTAp73+/+andTAp73-/-MEF cells. Importantly,TAp73-/-MEFs showed a strong reduction (~45-55%) in overall G6PD activity compared toTAp73+/+. However, no significant difference in G6PD activity was observed between DeltaNp73-/-and DeltaNp73+/+MEFs (Fig. 2c,d). Correlating with these results, deficiency of TAp73, but not of DeltaNp73, led to strong reduction in G6PD mRNA levels (Fig. 2c,d). To ascertain the stimulatory effect of TAp73 on G6PD, we used small interfering RNA (siRNA) to knock down p73 in U2OS cells. This led to a noticeable decline in both the activity and expression levels of G6PD (Fig. 2eandSupplementary Fig. S2b). Introducing an siRNA-resistant form of TAp73 in p73 siRNA-treated cells largely restored G6PD expression (Supplementary Fig. S2b), underscoring the specificity of the siRNA. Likewise, upon p73 knockdown, G6PD activity and expression were reduced in three isogenic human colorectal HCT116 cell lines, which were wild type forp53and its target genep21(p53+/+), deficient inp53(p53-/-), or deficient inp21(p21-/-) (Fig. 2f-h). A strong effect of p73 knockdown on G6PD was also observed in the normal human diploid fibroblast IMR90 cells (Fig. 2i). To examine the p73 isoform-specific effect on G6PD expression, we knocked down either total p73 or DeltaNp73 using siRNAs in HeLa cells, which express relatively high levels of DeltaNp73 compared to other cell lines tested (Supplementary Fig. S2c). Knockdown of total p73, but not DeltaNp73, led to a noticeable reduction in G6PD levels (Supplementary Fig. S2d). We also knocked down TAp73 using shRNA, which strongly decreased G6PD expression in U2OS, IMR90, and human lung cancer H1299 cells (Fig. 3a,bandSupplementary Fig. S2e,f). Conversely, enforced expression of a TAp73 isoform (TAp73alpha), but not the corresponding DeltaNp73 isoform (DeltaNp73alpha), augmented G6PD expression (Fig. 3candSupplementary Fig. S2g). Unlike TAp73, neither over-expression nor knockdown of p53, or the other p53 family member p63, affected G6PD levels (Fig. 3a,candSupplementary Fig. S2f,g). Together, these results indicate that TAp73 specifically enhances the expression of G6PD. p73 is activated by DNA damage signalsNone-None. WhenTAp73+/+MEFs were treated with the genotoxic agent etoposide (ETP), TAp73 was stabilized and G6PD expression was elevated (Fig. 3d). In contrast, ETP reduced G6PD expression inTAp73-/-MEFs (Fig. 3d). When IMR90 cells were treated with ETP, TAp73 was also stabilized, and both the G6PD mRNA and protein were significantly increased. However, when p73 was knocked down, G6PD failed to accumulate upon DNA damage (Fig. 3e). Together, these results suggest that TAp73 stimulates the expression of G6PD both at basal levels in unstressed cells and when TAp73 is stabilized by DNA damage. In addition, a TAp73-independent mechanism might reduce G6PD expression upon DNA damage, but TAp73 can override this effect. To determine whether TAp73 is a transcriptional activator for theG6PDgene, we analyzed the humanG6PDgene sequence for potential p53 family protein response elements (REs), which share the consensus sequence of 5'-RRRCWWGYYY-(0-13bp spacer)-RRRCWWG YYY-3' (where R is a purine, Y a pyrimidine, and W an A or T)None. One potential RE was identified in the second intron ofG6PD(Fig. 3f). To investigate the binding of p73 to this RE, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. In the p53-wild-type A549 cells, endogenous p73 bound to the RE region of theG6PDgene; the binding was strengthened when cells were treated with the DNA damaging agent doxorubicin (DOX), which stabilized the p53 family proteins (Fig. 3gandSupplementary Fig. S2h). We observed no association between endogenous p53 or p63 and theG6PDgene under these conditions (Fig. 3g), even though p53 bound strongly to its target genePumaas expected (Fig. 3i). Similarly, when H1299 cells were transfected individually with green fluorescence protein (GFP) fusions of p53 family members, GFP-TAp73alpha, but not GFP-p53 or GFP-TAp63alpha, associated with theG6PDgenomic DNA (Fig. 3h). To evaluate whether the RE withinG6PDconfers TAp73-dependent transcriptional activation, we cloned DNA fragments containing the wild-type RE or a mutant RE into the promoter region of a firefly luciferase reporter plasmid. Both TAp73alpha and TAp73beta were able to induce luciferase expression from the wild-type reporter plasmid but not from the mutant reporter plasmid (Fig. 3j,k). Consistent with previous observationsNone,None, TAp73beta had higher transactivation activity compared to TAp73alpha (Fig. 3j). In contrast, p53, TAp63a, and DeltaNp73 failed to activate the wild-type RE-responsive luciferase (Fig. 3jandSupplementary Fig. S2i). These results suggest that TAp73, not p53 or TAp63, binds to the consensus p53 family RE within the second intron ofG6PDand activatesG6PDexpression. Tumor-derived p53 mutants may impair the function of TAp73None. We tested two common p53 mutants, R175H and R273H. Over-expression of either mutant failed to suppress G6PD expression regardless whether TAp73 was co-expressed (Supplementary Fig. S2j). Also, knocking down these mutant forms of p53 did not affect the expression of G6PD (Fig. 3l). Thus, mutant p53 proteins may not impede the ability of TAp73 to stimulate G6PD expression. The PPP is a primary source of cellular NADPHNone. In MEF cells, the lack of TAp73, but not DeltaNp73, yielded noticeably reduced NADPH levels and increased NADP+/NADPH ratios (Fig. 4a,bandSupplementary Fig. S3a,b). Consistently with this finding, silencing p73 in U2OS and IMR90 cells lessened NADPH levels and raised NADP+/NADPH ratios (Fig. 4c,dandSupplementary Fig. S3c,d). Similar reductions in NADPH levels were also observed inp53+/+andp53-/-HCT116 cells devoid of p73 (Supplementary Fig. S3e). To ascertain that the effect of TAp73 on NADPH is mediated by G6PD, we stably over-expressed G6PD inTAp73-/-MEF cells and p73-depleted U2OS cells with retrovirus-mediated gene transfer. This restored the levels of G6PD expression and activity and reduced the NADP+/NADPH ratios in these cells (Fig. 4e-h). Therefore, TAp73 maintains cellular NADPH content by stimulating the expression of G6PD. G6PD plays an important role in anti-oxidant metabolism by producing NADPH to regenerate reduced glutathioneNone,None. Treatment ofTAp73+/+MEFs with a G6PD-specific siRNA or the G6PD inhibitor dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) led to the accumulation of ROS (Fig. 5aandSupplementary Fig. S4a,b). Similarly, when G6PD was depleted in U2OS and IMR90 cells, ROS levels markedly rose (Fig. 5bandSupplementary Fig. S4c). Importantly,TAp73-/-MEFs also exhibited high ROS levels, similar to G6PD siRNA or DHEA-treatedTAp73+/+MEFs. InTAp73-/-MEFs, treatment with DHEA or G6PD siRNA only slightly increased ROS (Fig. 5aandSupplementary Fig. S4a,b). Similarly, U2OS and IMR90 cells devoid of p73 contained high levels of ROS, and knockdown of G6PD in these cells only raised ROS slightly higher (Fig. 5bandSupplementary Fig. S4c). We next examined the effect of TAp73 on cellular capacity to withstand oxidative stresses. Compared toTAp73+/+cells,TAp73-/-MEFs were markedly more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) treatment (Fig. 5candSupplementary Fig. S4d). Inhibition of G6PD by siRNA or DHEA reduced the survival ofTAp73-/-cells and especiallyTAp73+/+cells, minimizing their difference (Fig. 5candSupplementary Fig. S4d). Knockdown of p73 in U2OS also sensitized these cells to H2O2treatment, and silencing G6PD diminished the difference between these cells and the control cells (Supplementary Fig. S4e). To ascertain that the sensitivity of TAp73-deficient cells to oxidative stresses is due to the reduction in G6PD expression, we tested the effect of G6PD expression in these cells. Forced expression of G6PD inTAp73-/-MEFs and p73-depleted U2OS cells reduced the ROS content (Fig. 5d,e). It also significantly enhanced the survival of p73-depeleted cells in the presence of H2O2(Fig. 5f). Together, these data suggest that TAp73 plays a role in protecting against oxidative stress and that this effect of TAp73 is mediated, at least in part, by G6PD. The PPP provides NADPH and ribose, both of which are important synthetic precursors for nucleic acids. We compared DNA synthesis inTAp73+/+andTAp73-/-MEFs using 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assays. DNA synthesis was sharply reduced inTAp73-/-MEFs compared toTAp73+/+MEFs (Fig. 6a). Likewise, DNA synthesis slowed down when p73 was silenced in U2OS and various HCT116 cells (Fig. 6b,candSupplementary Fig. S5a,b). In each cell type, treatment with DHEA or G6PD siRNA inhibited DNA synthesis in TAp73-depleted cells and especially in control cells, diminishing the difference between them (Fig. 6a-candSupplementary Fig. S5a,b). We also examined the effect of p73 on cell cycle progression. Knockdown of p73 led to a reduction in the number of cells in S phase and an increase in the number of cells in G1 and G2/M phases. This effect was independent of the status of p53 and the p53/p73-inducible cell cycle regulator p21. Knockdown of G6PD diminished the difference in DNA synthesis between p73-depleted cells and control cells (Fig. 6dandSupplementary Fig. S5c,d). Conversely, forced expression of G6PD almost completely restored DNA synthesis in p73-depleted U2OS cells (Fig. 6e). These results suggest that TAp73 stimulates DNA synthesis via G6PD. The loss TAp73 in mouse cells accelerates cellular senescenceNone. We investigated the role of G6PD in this process using human IMR90 cells, a well-established model for senescence. Compared to cultures treated with control siRNA, IMR90 cultures treated with p73 siRNA showed a noticeable increase in the number of cells with senescence phenotypes, including flat morphology and the expression of the senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-gal) (Fig. 6fandSupplementary Fig. S5e). Knockdown of G6PD increased the number of senescent cells strongly in control cultures, but relatively moderately in p73-depleted cultures, reducing the difference between these two groups (Supplementary Fig. S5e). More importantly, over-expression of G6PD effectively reversed the induction of senescence in p73-depeleted cultures (Fig. 6f). These data suggest that the lack of TAp73 induces senescence in IMR90 cells due to the down-regulation of G6PD. Knockdown of p73 strongly impeded cell growth in various cell lines, including MEFs, U2OS, and isogenic HCT116 cell lines (Fig. 1a,c,7a, andSupplementary Fig. S1b,d,S6a-c). Growth delay due to p73 down-regulation also occurred inp53-/-HCT116 cells (Supplementary Fig. S6b), indicating a requirement for p73 in cell growth regardless of the status of p53. Depletion of G6PD reduced growth rate in control cells and especially in TAp73 knockdown cells (Fig. 7aandSupplementary Fig. S6a-c). Conversely, enforced expression of G6PD partially restored cell growth in p73 knockdown U2OS cells andTAp73-/-MEF cells but had a minimal effect on control cells (Fig. 7b,candSupplementary Fig. S6d-h). We examined whether the growth-stimulatory effect of TAp73 is related to both a decrease in ROS and an increase in intracellular nucleotides, two main outcomes of the PPP flux. We culturedTAp73+/+andTAp73-/-MEF cells in medium containing the ROS scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), four ribonucleosides (A, G, U, and C) plus four deoxynucleosides (dA, dG, dT, and dC), or both. Nucleosides in culture medium can be taken up by cells and converted to the corresponding nucleotides, thus bypassing the requirement forde novoribose synthesisNone,None. Importantly, in the presence of both NAC and nucleotides, but neither individually,TAp73-/-MEFs grew nearly as well asTAp73+/+MEF cells (Fig. 7d). Moreover, combination treatment with NAC and nucleotides rescued the growth ofTAp73-/-MEFs stably overexpressing G6PD or vector control, but to lesser extents compared toTAp73-/-MEFs (Supplementary Fig. S6e-h). These results suggest that TAp73 promotes cell proliferation at least partially through up-regulating G6PD, which leads to simultaneous reduction of ROS and enhancement of ribose synthesis. Analysis of G6PD expression and metastasis status of a large number of primary breast tumors revealed that increasing G6PD expression was significantly correlated with the risk of metastasis (Supplementary Fig. S7a,b). To evaluate the role of G6PD in tumor formation, we injected immuno-compromised mice with U2OS cells orTAp73+/+MEF cells expressingG6PDsiRNA or control siRNA. G6PDsiRNA-expressing cells generated much smaller tumors compared to control cells (Fig. 7e, gandSupplementary Fig. S7d). Conversely, reintroduction of G6PD partially restored tumor formation byTAp73-/-MEFs (Fig. 7fandSupplementary Fig. S7c). We also tested the effect of NAC on the growth of TAp73 and G6PD-deficient tumor cells. In agreement with cell proliferation results, NAC alone failed to reverse the inhibition of tumor growth derived from eitherTAp73-/-MEFs or G6PD-silenced MEFs (Fig. 7gandSupplementary Fig. S7d). The present study indicates that TAp73 promotes G6PD expression and PPP flux, enhancing biosynthesis and ROS detoxification. Metabolic reprogramming in tumor cells is altered to meet the demand for robust production of macromolecules while minimizing oxidative damagesNone-None. Both require NADPH, and it has been proposed that NADPH production is a rate-liming step in cell proliferationNone,None. Indeed, the production of NAPDH appears to be tightly controlled by oncogenes and tumor suppressors. For instance, the oncogene K-Ras stimulates NADPH production in pancreatic cancer cells by enhancing the flux through malic enzyme 1, a cytoplasmic isoform of the NADPH-generating malic enzymesNone. In contrast, p53 inhibits the expression of all three malic enzymes that are localized either in the cytoplasm or in the mitochondriaNone. The PPP is not only a major source for NADPH but also highly responsive to oxidative stressNone,None. G6PD is a common target for directly adjusting PPP flux. For example, it is allosterically activated by its substrate NADP+and inhibited by its product NADPH. This homeostatic regulation ensures that the PPP is up-regulated when more NADPH is neededNone. The stimulation of G6PD expression by TAp73 may represent a major mechanism that modulates G6PD expression. We found that G6PD over-expression partially restores the growth ofTAp73-/-MEF cells and p73-depleted U2OS cells. This suggests that, at least in these cells, other TAp73 targets may contribute to its proliferative function. For example, a recent study revealed a role of TAp73 in regulating cytochromecoxidase subunit 4 (Cox4i1), a subunit of the complex IV of the mitochondrial electron transport chainNone. By maintaining levels of G6PD as well as Cox4il, TAp73 likely plays a pre-eminent role in anti-oxidant response in both unstressed and stressed cells. Nevertheless, ROS scavengers alone cannot rescue the proliferative defects of TAp73-deficient cells. Rather, both ROS scavengers and nucleosides are needed (Fig. 7). These observations suggest that TAp73 promotes nucleotide synthesis as well as anti-oxidant defense, and that the PPP may be a main proliferative target of TAp73. Previous studies showed that upon over-expression, TAp73 could activate certain p53 target genes involved in apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Yet, the physiological function of TAp73 is likely determined by its endogenous levels of expression, its interplay with the DeltaN isoforms, and its regulation by upstream factors. Despite high similarity among p53 family members in the DNA-binding domain, TAp73 alone is able to induce G6PD expression, although the mechanism underlying this selectivity remains to be determined (Fig. 3). Moreover, DeltaNp73 and tumor-associated p53 mutants do not appear to inhibit this function of TAp73 (Fig. 3). These observations support the notion that G6PD is a high-affinity, physiologically relevant target of TAp73, and that tumor cells benefit from TAp73 up-regulation even in the presence of elevated DeltaNp73 or mutated p53 proteins. The critical role of TAp73 in cell proliferation raises the question of why TAp73 deficient mice show increased tumor formation. An explanation may be that extensive genomic instability associated with congenital loss of TAp73 outweighs any proliferative defects in these mice by facilitating the accumulation of oncogenic mutations. It is noteworthy that the function of TAp73 in maintaining genomic stability appears to be cell type-specific, as it operates in lung fibroblasts but not in thymic cells, and thatTAp73-/-mice primarily develop lung adenocarcinomasNone. The role of TAp73 in G6PD expression, on the other hand, is observed in different cell types that have been tested in the current study. Rare mutations and prevalent up-regulation of TAp73 in a variety of human tumors suggest that human tumor cells opt for the powerful and probably ubiquitous proliferative advantages provided by TAp73. Accumulating evidence indicates that PPP flux is enhanced in tumor cells either directly or indirectly. p53 suppresses the PPP through a direct interaction with G6PD. This activity is lost in tumor-derived p53 mutantsNone. PKM2, an isoform of pyruvate kinase that catalyzes the last step in glycolysis, is widely expressed in tumor cells. PKM2 has a lowKMfor its substrate, leading to the build-up of glycolytic intermediates for alternative pathways including the PPPNone. The direct regulation of G6PD and PPP by two members of the p53 family, as well as indirectly by other mechanisms, underscores both their importance in tumorigenesis and their potential as therapeutic targets.

HCT116 cells and MEF cells were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), and when indicated, in Minimum Essential Medium Eagle with ribonucleosides and deoxyribonucleosides (Sigma, M8042). TAp73-/-, DeltaNp73-/-, and the corresponding wild-type MEFs have been previously describedNone,None. U2OS cells were maintained in McCoy's 5A Medium, IMR90 cells in MEMalpha medium, and H1299 cells in RPMI1640 medium (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). All mediums, if not specifically described, were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Expression plasmids for shRNAs were made in a pLKO.1-puro vector. The targeted sequences were: p53, 5'-GACTCCAGTGGTAATCTAC-3'None; p63alpha, 5'-GGGTGAGCGTGTTATTGATGCT-3'None, and TAp73, 5'-GGATTCCAGCATGGACGTCTT-3'None(all of human origin). The following siRNAs were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA) with the catalog number and sequences indicated: human G6PD, HSS103893, 5'-AAACCCACUCUCUUCAUCAGCUCGU-3'; humanp73, HSS186396, 5'-GAGCUCGGGAGGGACUUCAACGAAG-3'; and rat/mouse G6PD, RSS302151, 5'-CCACCAAGCUGAUACACACAUAUUU-3'; human DeltaNp73, 5'-UACGUCGGUGACCCCGCACGGU-3'. siRNAs were transfected into cells using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX transfection Agent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) following the manufacturer's instruction. Stable shRNA transfectants were selected in medium containing 1 mug/ml puromycin (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA, catalog No: 540222) as previously describedNone. Total RNA was isolated from cells by TRIzol(r) Reagent (Invitrogen, catalog No. 15596018) and 2 mug RNA of each sample was reversed to cDNA by First-strand cDNA Synthesis System (Marligen Biosciences, catalog No. 11801). 0.2 mug cDNA of each sample was used as a template to perform PCR. The primer pairs for human genes were: G6PD, 5'-ATGGCAGAGCAGGTGGCCCT-3' and 5'-TCATGCAGGACTCGTGAATG-3'; beta-actin, 5'-GACCTGACTGACTACCTCATGAAGAT-3' and 5'-GTCACACTTCATGATGGAGTTGAAGG-3'; p53, 5'-CACGAGCTGCCCCCAGG-3' and 5'-TCAGTCGACGTCTGAGT-3'; human p63, 5'-ACATGAATGGACTCAGCCCC-3' and 5'-TCACTCCCCCTCCTCTTTGAT-3'; TAp73, 5'-ATGGCCCAGTCCACCGCCACC-3' and 5'-TCGAAGGTGGAGCTGGG-3'.

G6PD enzyme activity was determined as describedNone. The combined activity of G6PD and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD), the second enzyme of the PPP that also produces NADPH, was determined by the rate of conversion of NADP+to NADPH in the presence of glucose-6-phosphate (G6P). 6PGD activity was measured by the conversion of NADP+to NADPH in the presence of 6-phosphogluconate (6PG). G6PD activity was calculated by subtracting 6PGD from the combined activity. The reaction buffer contained 50 mM Tris (pH 8.1) and 1 mM MgCl2, and substrate concentrations were: G6P (200 muM) and 6PG (200 muM) and NADP+(100 muM). Enzyme activities were normalized based on protein concentration, which was determined by a Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA, cat. no. 500-0006). The data are expressed in arbitrary absorption units. To identify potential p53 family protein response elements, we scan the G6PD gene using the Genomatix Promoter Inspector Program (Genomatrix Inc, Munich, Germany, software,http://www.genomatix.de). For ChIP assays, cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature and cross-linking was stopped by the addition of 125 nM glycine (final concentration). Cell lysates were sonicated to generate DNA fragments with an average size below 1,000 bp and immunoprecipitated with indicated antibodies. Bound DNA fragments were eluted and amplified by PCR. Primer pairs were:g6pd, 5'-CCCTACTGTCCGTCTTACCTC-3' (+6164/+6185) and 5'-CTCTCACTGCTGCACCCTTC-3' (+6643/+6663);puma, 5-TGGCCTTGTGTCTGTGAGTAC-3; and 5-GGACAAGTCAGGACTTGCAGG-3'None. For reporter assay, TheG6PDgenomic fragments (+6164 to +6663) containing either the wild-type (GGTCATGAGCAAACATGACC) or mutant (GGTTATTAGCAAATATTACC, with mutated nucleotides underlined) p73-binding region were cloned into pGL3-basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA, catalog No: E1751). Luciferase reporter assays were performed as described previouslyNone. Briefly, The reporter plasmids were transfected into p53-null H1299 cells together with aRenillaluciferase plasmid and increasing amounts of plasmids expressing p53 family proteins. 24 h after transfection, the luciferase activity was determined using a dual Luciferase Assay System (Promega, catalog No: E1910). Transfection efficiency was normalized on the basis of the Renilla luciferase activity. NADPH levels and NADP+/NADPH ratios were determined using the NADP+/NADPH Quantification kit (BioVision, Mountain View, CA, USA, catalog No: K347). ROS levels were analyzed as describedNone. Briefly, cells were incubated at 37 degrees C for 30 min in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 10 muM 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2-DCFDA). Cells were then washed twice with PBS, treated with trypsin, and re-suspended in PBS. Fluorescence was immediately measured using a FACScan Flow Cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). The flux of the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway was measured based on the rate of glucose consumption and the ratio of13C incorporated into carbon 2 (generated by glycolysis) and carbon 3 (generated by the PPP) of lactate determined by NMR spectroscopy as described previouslyNone,None. Cells were washed with PBS twice and fixed with 75% ethanol overnight at -20 degrees C. cells were then treated with 0.1% tritonx-100 and 50 mug/ml RNase A for 30 minutes at 37 degrees C followed by PI staining. Cell cycle distribution was analyzed using a FACScalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, CA). The data was analyzed using Flow Jo software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR). Cells were treated withG6PDsiRNA or control siRNA. After indicated times, cells were pulse-labeled with BrdU (10 muM final concentration) for 1 h and analyzed by anti-BrdU immunostaining as describedNone. In brief, BrdU-labeled cells were washed with PBS and fixed sequentially with 2% paraformaldehyde and 70% ethanol at 4 degrees C. Afterwards, cells were permeabilized with 0.2% TritonX-100 and washed with TBS. DNA was then denatured in 4N HCl-0.2% TritonX-100 for 2 h followed by sequential staining with anti-BrdU antibody and FITC-labeled BrdU specific antibody. The images were acquired with an Olympus DP71X microscope (Olympus, Center Valley, PA) and BrdU-positive cells were counted. The FITC signal was converted to a red color for better visualization. Xenograft study was performed as describedNone. Briefly, cells were injected subcutaneously into the flanks of 4- to 5-wk-old athymic Balb-c nu/nu male mice (Taconic Farms, Germantown, NY). Three mice total were used for each treatment inFig. 1b, 1dandFig. 7e. Four mice (Fig. 7f) and eight mice (Fig. 7g) were used for each treatment. Tumor growth was evaluated at 2 or 3 weeks post-injection as indicated. All animal experiments were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations and were approved by the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). The SA-beta-gal activity in cultured cells was determined using a Senescence Detection Kit (BioVision, Mountain View, CA, USA, catalog No: K320) following the manufacturer's instructions. Percentages of SA-beta-gal positive cells were calculated by counting more than 1,000 cells in random fields per cell line. Cell proliferation assay were performed as describedNone. Briefly, cells were transfected with siRNAs for 24 h and seeded in 6-well cell culture dishes in triplicates at a density of 5,000 or 20,000 cells as indicated per well in 2 ml of medium supplemented with 10% FBS. The medium was changed everyday. Cell number at the indicated time points was determined by counting using a hemocytometer. For Crystal Violet (CV) staining, cells were fixed with 10% Formalin for 5 minutes and stained with 0.05% CV for 30 minutes. After washed with distilled water, cells were photographed. Statistical significance was analyzed by Student's t-test and expressed as a P value. Whole-cell lysates were made in modified RIPA lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 1% Sodium deoxycholate, 0.025% SDS and complete protease cocktail) for 15 min on ice, and boiled in 2 * loading buffer. Protein samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane, which was blocked in 5% skim milk in TBST and probed with the indicated antibodies. We used a combined series of 871 breast cancer patients available through the GEO (accession numbers: GSE1456, GSE2990, GSE3494, GSE7390, GSE11121). All samples were profiled using the Affymetrix U133a microarray platform. Raw data were downloaded, processed using the RMA method, z-score transformed, and median centered. Probes mapping to the same gene were combined by using the probe with the highest variance. For Cox multivariable regression, G6PD and age were used as continuous variables, while other clinical and pathological factors were used as binary variables. Missing data were imputed. For Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, G6PD levels were discretized by using a mean cut-off. All survival analysis was performed using the R package "survival" version 2.37 and the R language and environment for statistical computing version 2.15.
