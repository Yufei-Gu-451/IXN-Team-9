MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in essential biological activities (Harfe, 2005;CarletonNone, 2007). Recent studies have revealed differential expression of miRNAs in various cancers, including oral cancer, suggesting that certain miRNAs play roles in tumourigenesis (GarzonNone, 2009;WuNone, 2011). In addition, previous studies have revealed that some miRNAs are closely associated with clinical outcomes (SchetterNone, 2008). Moreover, miRNA expression may predict the efficacy of therapies, including radiotherapy (NiemoellerNone, 2011). In fact, miRNAs have been shown to modulate the radiosensitivity of primary human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (Wagner-EckerNone, 2010), lung cancer cells (WeidhaasNone, 2007) and breast cancer cells (KatoNone, 2009). However, irradiation-induced alterations in miRNA profiles have not been analysed in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Thus, this study aimed to identify miRNAs associated with radioresistance in OSCC and reveal their biological function and clinical significance. To identify crucial miRNAs forintercellular adhesion molecule-2(ICAM2) expression, we examined miRNAs that had binding sites likeICAM2and had been reported to be related to human cancer, especially proliferation, radioresistance and chemoresistance, with publicly available algorithms (TargetScan (http://www.targetscan.org/), EMBL-EBI (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/) or microRNA.org (http://www.microrna.org/microrna/)). The OSCC-derived cell lines used were HSC-2, HSC-3, HSC-4, SCC4, HO-1-N-1 and Ca9-22 (Human Science Research Resources Bank, Osaka, Japan). Five independent human normal oral keratinocyte (HNOK) cell lines were cultured and maintained in defined keratinocyte-serum-free medium (Life Technologies Corporation, Grand Island, NY, USA) (ShiibaNone, 2010). Tissue samples from 50 unrelated Japanese patients with primary OSCC who were treated at Chiba University Hospital (Supplementary Table 1) were collected after obtaining informed consents under a protocol that was approved by the Chiba University institutional review board. Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol Reagent (Life Technologies Corporation) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesised from total RNA using Ready-To-Go You-Prime First-Strand Beads (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK), an oligo(dT) primer (Sigma-Aldrich Co. LLC, St Louis, MO, USA) forICAM2and the NCode VILO miRNA cDNA Synthesis Kit (Life Technologies Corporation) for miRNA, according to the manufacturers' protocols. Real-time qRT-PCR was performed to validate miRNA and mRNA expression with the NCode EXPRESS SYBR GreenER microRNA qRT-PCR Kit (Life Technologies Corporation) for miRNA and a LightCycler FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green 1 Kit (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) for mRNA. Normalised expression was calculated with 18S ribosomal RNA for miRNA and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase for mRNA. Transcript amount was estimated from standard curves and normalised. The nucleotide sequences of the specific primers for miRNAs andICAM2are shown inSupplementary Table 2. The HSC-2 and HSC-3 cells (2 * 105) were transfected with mirVana miRNA mimic (microRNA-125b) and mirVana miRNA Mimic Negative Control #1 (Life Technologies Corporation) at a final concentration of 50 nM. The cells were transfected with miRNA duplexes with Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Life Technologies Corporation) by following the manufacturer's protocol. The pmax-green fluorescent protein (GFP) plasmid (Lonza Group Ltd, Basel, Switzerland) was co-transfected simultaneously, and the transfection efficiency was determined by analysing GFP-expressing cells with flow cytometry. The full-length 3'-untranslated region (UTR) ofICAM2containing putative miR-125b-binding sites was subcloned into a pmirGLO Dual-Luciferase miRNA Target Expression Vector (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA) located 3' to the firefly luciferase translational stop codon. A mutant 3'-UTR ofICAM2with a mutated sequence (5'-...AACTCAGTGTGACTCNoneTTGAGGTCC...-3') in the complementary site for the miR-125b seed region was generated with fusion PCR (mutated sequence is expressed as italic and underlined). For the luciferase reporter assay, HSC-2 cells (5 * 104) were placed in 24-well plates and co-transfected with 0.2 mug of pmirGLO-3'-UTR-WT (ICAM2-WT) or pmirGLO-3'-UTR-MUT (ICAM2-Mut) and miR-125b or negative control with Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies Corporation). Assays were performed 24 h after transfection with the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega Corporation). Transfections were done three times in independent experiments. Transfectant and parental cells were seeded in 12-well plates (1 * 104viable cells per well). Cells were harvested 1, 2, 3 and 4 days later, and the cells were trypsinised and counted with a haemocytometer in triplicate. Transfectant and parental cells were irradiated with four single-radiation doses (2, 4, 6 and 8 Gy) with X-ray-irradiation equipment (MBR-1520R-3; Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) at a source-to-target distance of 55 cm when the cells reached 70-80% confluence (HigoNone, 2005;IshigamiNone, 2008). The colonies were stained with crystal violet (Sigma-Aldrich Co. LLC), and colonies of ?50 cells were counted (IshigamiNone, 2008). Each experiment was repeated at least three times. Clinicopathological profiles were assessed bychi2tests and Fisher's exact tests. Overall survival rate was investigated by Kaplan-Meier analyses, and the difference was analysed with log-rank tests. Student'st-tests were used for other analyses. All tests were two sided. P less than 0.05 was considered significant. We initially performed predicted target gene analyses ofICAM2mRNA with publicly available algorithms to find miRNA that potentially regulatedICAM2expression. The databases showed that miR-125b had complementary sequences forICAM2mRNA, suggesting that miR-125b could directly regulateICAM2activity through imperfect base pairing with theICAM2mRNA 3'-UTR (Supplementary Figure 1A-C). Altered miR-125b expression has been reported in various human cancers, and miR-125b-induced cell cycle arrest has been reported for several cancers (GuanNone, 2011;HuangNone, 2011;ZhangNone, 2011). We hypothesised that miR-125b plays a role in OSCC by regulatingICAM2expression. Thus, miR-125b was analysed further. The expression of miR-125b was less than twice that of HNOK cells in all cell lines (Figure 1A). Lower expression levels were observed in 39 of 50 (78%) OSCC samples compared with matched normal tissues (Figure 1B). The median miR-125b expression level was 0.280 and 0.132 in normal tissues and OSCC samples, respectively (Figure 1C), which was significant (P=0.019; Student'st-test). The relationship between clinical factors and miR-125b expression was evaluated (Table 1). The expression of miR-125b was significantly lower in advanced stages (III+IV) than in early stages (I+II) (P=0.037). Tumours with significant miR-125b downregulation (median less than 0.34) were considered low miR-125b (n=25). Survival curves for miR-125b expression are shown inFigure 1D. Kaplan-Meier analyses indicated that miR-125b expression was significantly associated with overall survival (P=0.038;Figure 1D), suggesting that decreased miR-125b expression in patients with OSCCs was significantly associated with poor prognoses. After validating miR-125b overexpression (Supplementary Figure 2A and B) with appropriate transfection efficiency, miR-125b-transfected cells were subjected to functional assays. The proliferation rate was significantly lower in miR-125b-transfected HSC-2 and HSC-3 cells after 72 and 96 h compared with negative controls (Figures 2A and B). In HSC-2 and HSC-3 cells, the survival rates were significantly decreased in 6-Gy-irradiated and 8-Gy-irradiated miR-125b transfectants compared with negative controls (Figures 2C and D). We examined whether altered radiosensitivity was associated with the ICAM2-related signalling pathway. The expression ofICAM2was downregulated in miR-125b-transfected OSCC cells (Figure 2E and F). The relative luciferase activity of the reporter gene containing wild-typeICAM23'-UTR was significantly suppressed when miR-125b was co-transfected. However, decreased luciferase activity was not observed in cells with the reporter gene containing mutatedICAM23'-UTR (Figure 2G). This suggested that theICAM23'-UTR was a miR-125b target and that miR-125b suppressedICAM2expression through binding. We have previously identified genes, includingICAM2, that play important roles in OSCC radioresistance (HSC-2 and HSC-3) (IshigamiNone, 2007,2008). TheICAM2has been suggested to facilitate an apoptotic-blocking survival signal by activating the PI3K/AKT pathway (PerezNone, 2002). Another study has reported thatICAM2expression deficiencies result in impaired angiogenesisin vitroandin vivo, defectivein vitromigration and increased apoptosis (HuangNone, 2005). The downregulation ofICAM2siRNA enhanced OSCC radiosensitivity and increased apoptosis through AKT phosphorylation and caspase-3 activation (IshigamiNone, 2008). Moreover,ICAM2overexpression induced greater OSCC resistance to X-ray irradiation (IshigamiNone, 2007). In this study, decreasedICAM2expression was observed in both miR-125b-transfected HSC-2 and miR-125b-transfected HSC-3 cells; moreover, radiosensitivity towards X-ray irradiation was enhanced in miR-125b-transfected HSC-2 and HSC-3 cells. Luciferase reporter assays showed that theICAM23'-UTR was a miR-125b target. Therefore, the data strongly suggest that miR-125b is associated with radiation response through regulatingICAM2expression in OSCC. The importance of miR-125b as an anticancer agent was demonstrated by the impact of its expression on cell proliferation. We showed that OSSC-derived cells proliferated less rapidly when miR-125b expression was increased by transfection, suggesting that miR-125b could regulate cell proliferation. This finding may be associated with cell cycle regulation as miR-125b-induced cell cycle arrest has been reported for several cancers (GuanNone, 2011;HuangNone, 2011;ZhangNone, 2011). In conclusion, controlling miR-125b expression or activity could contribute to suppressing cell proliferation and overcoming radioresistance in OSCC, which could be useful in developing a cure for OSCC. Moreover, miR-125b was significantly correlated with survival and radiotherapy response in OSCC and could be used as a prognostic marker.
