The enzyme porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD), which is also known as hydroxymethylbilane synthase (EC 2.5.1.61), catalyses an early step of the tetrapyrrole-biosynthesis pathway in which four molecules of the monopyrrole porphobilinogen are condensed to form a linear tetrapyrrole, preuroporphyrinogen or hydroxymethyl-bilane (Fig. 1 ? ; Jordan, 1991 ? ). Isotopic labelling and single-turnover studies showed that the pyrrole-forming ringA(Fig. 1 ?) is the first to bind to the enzyme, followed by ringsB,Cand finallyD. PBGD is a monomeric protein with a molecular weight in the range 34-44 kDa depending on the species (Jordan, 1991 ? ). The enzyme possesses a dipyrromethane cofactor (Fig. 2 ?) which is covalently bound to the enzyme by a thioether linkage involving an invariant cysteine residue (Jordan Warren, 1987 ? ). The cofactor acts as a primer to which four porphobilinogen molecules are attached sequentially prior to cleavage of the link between the cofactor and the first substrate molecule on completion of the reaction. Thus, the cofactor remains covalently attached to the enzyme when the product of the reaction is released. The X-ray structure of theArabidopsis thalianaenzyme has recently been solved (PDB entry4htg; Robertset al. , 2013 ? ); prior to this, structures were available forEscherichia coliPBGD [PDB entries1pda(Louieet al. , 1992 ? , 1996 ? ),1gtk(Helliwellet al. , 2003 ? ),1ah5(Hadeneret al. , 1999 ? ),1ypn(Helliwellet al. , 1998 ?) and2ypn(Niehet al. , 1999 ?)] and the human enzyme (PDB entries3eq1and3ecr; Gillet al. , 2009 ? ; Songet al. , 2009 ? ). The polypeptide is folded into three domains (1-3), each of approximately the same size. The general architecture of domains 1 and 2 shows a strong resemblance to a number of periplasmic binding proteins. The dipyrromethane cofactor is attached to a loop on domain 3 and is positioned at the mouth of a deep active-site cleft formed between domains 1 and 2. The Gram-positive bacteriumBacillus megateriumis of great industrial interest since it has many commercial applications in the biotechnological production of numerous substances, including the tetrapyrrole vitamin B12. Here, we report the expression and crystallization of PBGD fromB. megateriumin a form that diffracts synchrotron radiation to very high resolution. TheB. megateriumPBGD gene was cloned into theNdeI andBamHI restriction sites of the expression vector pET14b using standard methods and was transformed into Rosetta (DE3)E. colicells (Novagen). Expression was undertaken using 500 ml cultures, which were grown overnight at 310 K following induction with 0.2 mMisopropyl beta-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at mid-log phase. The cultures were then centrifuged at 5000 rev min-1for 15 min with a Beckman Coulter Avanti J-26 XP ultracentrifuge using a JLA-8.1000 rotor to obtain the cell pellet. The 3.75 g pellet obtained from a 1 l culture was then resuspended in 25 ml 50 mMTris-HCl buffer pH 8 and sonicated on ice using an MSI Soniprep 150 instrument. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 12 000 rev min-1using a Beckman JA-25.50 rotor to separate the cell debris from the supernatant. The clear supernatant was then loaded onto a pre-equilibrated HisTrap HP (GE Healthcare) 1 ml column, allowing the His-tagged PBGD to bind prior to washing the column with binding buffer in order to remove impurities. The enzyme was eluted with a buffer containing 500 mMimidazole and the polyhistidine tag was removed by the addition of thrombin (one unit per milligram of purified protein) followed by overnight incubation at room temperature. The cleaved tag and thrombin were then removed by passing the previously dialysed protein through a HisTrap HP 1 ml column again followed by a HiTrap Benzamidine FF 1 ml column (GE Healthcare). The final yield of purifiedB. megateriumPBGD was approximately 10-12 mg per litre of cell culture. Curiously, the cells and purified protein had a marked pink colouration, although over a period of several weeks the protein became yellow, presumably owing to slow oxidation of the cofactor. The purified native PBGD was concentrated to 2.5 mg ml-1using a Vivaspin centrifugal concentrator and was subjected to screening for crystallization conditions by use of the hanging-drop method with Molecular Dimensions Structure Screens I and II. After about two weeks, yellow crystals appeared in Structure Screen I condition 15 (0.1 Msodium cacodylate pH 6.5, 0.2 Mmagnesium acetate, 20% PEG 8K) at room temperature (Fig. 3 ? ). Subsequent optimization screens revealed that crystals could be obtained reproducibly in 0.1 Msodium cacodylate pH 6.5-6.8, 0.2 Mmagnesium acetate, 25-30% PEG 8K. Removal of the His tag (as described above) was found to be necessary to obtain crystals of this enzyme. Selected crystals were treated by the addition of glycerol to approximately 40%(v/v) before mounting in loops and flash-cooling with an Oxford Cryosystems cryocooler. X-ray data collection using station I03 at the Diamond Light Source (DLS, Didcot, England) revealed that theB. megateriumPBGD crystals were of very high diffraction quality (Fig. 4 ? ). Using 1 degrees oscillations, 190 degrees of data were collected from a single crystal maintained at a temperature of 100 K using a PILATUS 6M-F detector with an exposure time of 1 s per image (15% transmission) and a crystal-to-detector distance of 268.8 mm. The incident beam had a wavelength of 0.976 A. Data processing withMOSFLM(Leslie, 2006 ? ),SCALA(Evans, 2006 ?) and other programs in theCCP4 suite (Winnet al. , 2011 ?) revealed that the crystals belonged to the monoclinic space groupP212121, with unit-cell parametersa= 53.3,b= 65.8,c= 97.2 A. Inspection of the correlation coefficient for half-data-set intensities, as recommended by Karplus Diederichs (2012 ?) and Evans (2012 ? ), suggests that the diffraction data extend to a resolution ofdmin= 1.46 A with an overallRmergeof 6.1% and anRmeasof 6.7% (for details, see Table 1 ? ). By using the method of Matthews (1968 ? ), as implemented by Kantardjieff Rupp (2003 ? ), it was estimated that the crystals contained a single PBGD monomer per crystallographic asymmetric unit with a solvent content of 53%. Structure analysis by use of the molecular-replacement programMOLREP(Vagin Teplyakov, 2010 ?) withE. coliPBGD (47% identity; PDB entry1pda; Louieet al. , 1992 ?) as the search model was successful and refinement of theB. megateriumPBGD structure is currently in progress using this high-resolution data set.
