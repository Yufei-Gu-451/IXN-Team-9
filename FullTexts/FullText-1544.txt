Rice (Oryza sativa) is one of the most widely consumed cereals, being cultivated in ~156 million ha, with ~660 Mt harvested in 2008 (IRRI, 2010). Rice is the main carbohydrate source for more than half the world's population. It is mainly consumed in its polished form, which is very poor in micronutrients such as iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn). Human Fe nutritional deficiency affects 3 billion people, being the most common mineral nutritional disorder, while Zn deficiency is the second (Welch and Graham, 2004). Therefore, it is important to understand the mechanisms of micronutrient import to the rice grain and develop strategies to increase the levels of these nutrients (WirthNone, 2009). Although required at relatively low concentrations in plant tissues, heavy metals such as Zn, copper (Cu), and Fe are equally important for the completion of a plant's life cycle; crop yield is therefore severely impacted by growth on soils with low mineral phytoavailability. Additionally, along with other non-essential heavy metals such as cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb), these micronutrients are toxic when present in excess, with plants exhibiting symptoms such as chlorosis, necrosis, and growth inhibition (Marschner, 1995). For successful improvement of crops and subsequently human nutrition, it is important to understand the biological processes that govern uptake, homeostasis, and distribution of each ion throughout the plant (PalmgrenNone, 2008;MillsNone, 2010,2012;MikkelsenNone, 2012). Zn is important for enzymatic activity and for gene regulation by transcription factors, being described as a cofactor in greater than 300 proteins (PalmgrenNone, 2008). Although essential for completing a plant's life cycle, it is toxic above threshold concentrations and must, therefore, be maintained within a narrow adequate range. This is regulated in plant cells by specialized transporters, controlling the distribution of Zn within the cell. Those at the plasma membrane transport Zn into or out of the cell. Others, positioned at subcellular membranes, compartmentalize Zn when concentrations within the cellular fluid become toxic; this often involves transport to the vacuole. An array of transporter families exists, allowing plants to cope with varying substrate availabilities, enabling responses to a variety of stress conditions, and meeting specific transport requirements (Hall and Williams, 2003). Cation diffusion facilitators (CDFs) are ubiquitous in all branches of life (Nies and Silver, 1995;MontaniniNone, 2007;GustinNone, 2011). Structural analysis suggests that most family members possess six transmembrane domains (TMDs), with cytoplasmic N- and C-termini (Paulsen and Saier, 1997). Key polar and charged residues conserved within TMDs I, II, V, and VI are likely to be involved in metal transport (Gaither and Eide, 2001;HaneyNone, 2005). Some members contain a histidine-rich cytoplasmic loop, thought to be vital for transporter specificity, which might act as a chaperone to determine the identity of metal ions to be transported (KawachiNone, 2008,2012;PodarNone, 2012). A signature sequence, proposed byPaulsen and Saier (1997)and modified byMontaniniNone(2007), enables predictions regarding uncharacterized CDF family members. Members of this family cluster phylogenetically according to their main substrate: Zn, Zn and Fe, or manganese (Mn). It has been suggested that metal selectivity of uncharacterized members can be inferred according to their cluster position (MontaniniNone, 2007). In plants, CDFs are known as metal tolerance proteins (MTPs;MontaniniNone, 2007). MTP genes have been cloned from a number of plant species and are shown to have a role in heavy metal transport (BlaudezNone, 2003;KimNone, 2004;KobaeNone, 2004;DelhaizeNone, 2007;PeiterNone, 2007;KawachiNone, 2008;PodarNone, 2012). TwelveMTPgenes have been classified inArabidopsisand 10 in rice (GustinNone, 2011). The first, identified asZATor Zinc Transporter of Arabidopsis (van der ZaalNone, 1999), was renamedAtMTP1. Overexpression inArabidopsisenhances Zn resistance (van der ZaalNone, 1999) while T-DNA insertion (KobaeNone, 2004) or RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated silencing (Desbrosses-FonrougeNone, 2005) increases Zn sensitivity. The Zn hyperaccumulator plantArabidopsis hallerihad a pentaplication of theMTP1gene during the evolutionary process, which is believed to have a role in Zn hypertolerance (ShahzadNone, 2010). AtMTP3is also thought to be involved in Zn transport (ArrivaultNone, 2006), whileAtMTP11transports Mn (DelhaizeNone, 2007;PeiterNone, 2007). The rice orthologueOsMTP1was recently characterized byYuanNone(2012)andLanNone(2012). Located on chromosome 5, it is most highly expressed in mature leaves and stem (YuanNone, 2012). Both overexpression and RNAi-mediated silencing suggest a role for the transporter in Zn, Cd, and nickel (Ni) movement, a hypothesis strengthened by functional complementation of yeast mutants (YuanNone, 2012). However, there is controversy over OsMTP1 localization, reported at the plasma membrane when expressed in onion epidermal cells (YuanNone, 2012) or at the vacuole when expressed inSaccharomyces cerevisiae(LanNone, 2012). This study aims to clarify the membrane localization of OsMTP1 and investigate the importance of key residues in transport ability and specificity. It is shown here that OsMTP1 is localized to the vacuole when stably expressedin planta. It is further demonstrated that OsMTP1 is a Zn transporter that can also transport cobalt (Co), Fe, and Cd. Moreover, it is shown that single residue substitutions can alter substrate specificity. Rice seeds (cultivar Nipponbare) were germinated for 4 d in an incubator at 28 degrees C, on filter paper soaked with distilled water, and transferred to holders positioned over plastic pots with 5 litres of nutrient solution (16 seedlings per pot). The nutrient solution contained 700 muM K2SO4, 100 muM KCl, 100 muM KH2PO4, 2mM Ca(NO3)2, 500 muM MgSO4, 10 muM H3BO3, 0.5 muM MnSO4, 0.5 muM ZnSO4, 0.2 muM CuSO4, 0.01 muM (NH4)6Mo7O24, and 100 muM Fe3+-EDTA (as described byKobayashiNone, 2005). The pH of the nutrient solution was adjusted to 5.4 by addition of 0.5mol l-1NaOH. Plants were kept at 28+/-1 degrees C under a photoperiod of 16h/8h light/dark (150 mumol m-2s-1) for 10 d. Solutions were replaced every 3-4 d and leaf samples were harvested for RNA extraction (described later). Arabidopsisplants were grown as previously described (MillsNone, 2010;JaffeNone, 2012) in soil containing equal proportions of vermiculite, Levingtons M2, and John Innes No. 2 compost (Fargro) in 8cm pots; 0.28g l-1Intercept insecticide (Bayer, Canada) was present and soil was sterilized by autoclaving at 121 degrees C for 15min at 1 bar pressure. Wild-type (ecotype Wassilewskija),mtp1-1mutant, and transgenic lines expressingOsMTP1-GFP(green fluorescent protein) were grown in a controlled-environment growth room with a day/night cycle (23 degrees C 16h light, 120 mumol m-2s-1; 18 degrees C 8h dark). The T-DNA knockoutmtp1-1mutant (KobaeNone, 2004) was kindly provided by Professor Masayoshi Maeshima (Nagoya University, Japan). These assays were similar to those previously described (MillsNone, 2008). Arabidopsis thalianaseed from wild-type (ecotype Wassilewskija),mtp1-1mutant, and transgenic T3homozygous lines expressingOsMTP1-GFP(lines 1 and 2) were sterilized in 15% (v/v) bleach for 15min and rinsed five times with sterile water. They were then inoculated onto plates containing 0.8% (w/v) agarose (Melford), 1% (w/v) sucrose, and half-strength Murashige and Skoog medium (Murashige and Skoog, 1962) with a range of Zn concentrations (provided as ZnSO4), from 0 to 500 muM. Seeds were stratified at 4 degrees C for 48h prior to transfer to a controlled-environment cabinet (22 degrees C, 16h light, 110 mumol m-2s-1; 18 degrees C, 8h dark), and plates were incubated vertically. Fresh weight and chlorophyll determinations were performed as described below. The cDNA sequence ofO. sativa OsMTP1(accession no. AY266290/LOC_Os05g03780) is found in GenBankTM. Total RNA from rice leaves was extracted using the Concert Plant RNA Reagent (Invitrogen) and treated with DNase I (Invitrogen). First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed with oligo(dT) and reverse transcriptase (M-MLV, Invitrogen) using 1 mug of RNA. TheOsMTP1full-length coding sequence was amplified from cDNA withPfuDNA polymerase (Promega) using forward primer 5'-CACCATGGACAGCCATAACTCAGCA and reverse primer 5'-CTACTCGCGCTCAATCTGAAT. In addition, reverse primer 5'-CTCGCGCTCAATCTGAATG was used to amplify a fragment without the stop codon referred to as non-stop (NS). PCR products were cloned into the entry vectorpENTR/D-TOPO(Invitrogen), using Gateway technology. Sequencing confirmed the nucleotide fidelity ofOsMTP1in the entry vector. Using Gateway technology,OsMTP1(NS) was transferred from the entry clone to thepMDC83 destination vector (for C-terminal GFP tagging), by LR recombination. Sequencing of expression clones was carried out to confirm correct transfer. Plasmids were transformed intoAgrobacterium tumefaciensGV3101 by electroporation. Plants (T-DNA knockoutmtp1-1mutant;KobaeNone, 2004) were transformed using the floral dip method (Clough and Bent, 1998) but including a 3h pre-induction ofvirgenes by addition of 100 muM acetosyringone to the culture before dipping. Homozygous T3plants were used for analysis. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was used to confirm expression ofOsMTP1inArabidopsis. To do this, RNA was isolated from 11-day-old seedlings grown on 0.5 MS agar plates. cDNA synthesis and RT-PCR were carried out as previously described (MillsNone, 2008) except that the primers used to detectOsMTP1were forward primer 5'-CACCATGGACAGCCATAACTCAGCA and reverse primer 5'-CTACTCGCGCTCAATCTGAAT. Fresh weight and chlorophyll concentrations were determined forA. thalianaseedlings of wild-type (ecotype Wassilewskija),mtp1-1mutant, and T3homozygous lines expressingOsMTP1-GFP(lines 1 and 2), as previously described (MillsNone, 2008). Seedlings were grown (as described above in the metal tolerance assays inArabidopsis) on six separate plates for a range of Zn concentrations, each plate having four wild-type seedlings, fourmtp1-1mutant seedlings, and four of each transgenic line. Following growth, the seedlings were removed from the plates using forceps and weighed (four seedlings per genotype), and placed in a tube for chlorophyll determination. Chlorophyll was determined after harvesting whole seedlings following extraction inN,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) (Moran and Porath, 1980). The data presented are from a representative experiment (conducted at least twice) and are the means from the six plates +/-SE expressed on a per seedling basis. The entry clonespENTR OsMTP1full-length andpENTR OsMTP1(NS) (described above) were used to introduce theOsMTP1cDNAs into the yeast expression vectorpAG426-GFP(AlbertiNone, 2007) by LR recombination, Gateway technology (Invitrogen). Site-directed mutagenesis usingOsMTP1(NS) from the entry vector as the DNA template was performed using the QuikChange(r)II XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The mutations generated are described in detail in the Results, and the primers used for generating the mutations are presented inSupplementary Table S1available atJXBonline. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing and recombined into pAG426-GFPvector as described above. Constructs were transformed intoS. cerevisiae: wild-type BY4741 (MATa, his3-1, leu2-0, met15-0, ura3-0) andzrc1 cot1double mutant (MATa; his3-1, leu2-0, met15-0, ura3-0, zrc1::natMX cot1::kanMX4) for Zn and Co complementation analyses; wild-type DY150 [MATa ura3-52, leu2-3, 112, trp1-1, his3-11, 15, ade2-1, can1-100(oc)] andccc1mutant [MATa ura3-52, leu2-3, 112, trp1-1, his3-11, 15, ade2-1, can1-100(oc) Deltaccc1::HIS3] for Fe complementation analyses; and wild-type BY4741 andycf1mutant (MATa his3-1, leu2-0, lys2-0, ura3-0, YDR135c::kanMX4) for Cd complementation analyses. The Zn-hypersensitivezrc1 cot1mutant was obtained from Dr U. Kramer (Ruhr University, Bochum), while other mutants were obtained from Euroscarf. Yeast transformation was performed using the LiOAc/PEG method (GietzNone, 1992). Transformants were selected on SC (synthetic complete) medium without uracil (5g l-1ammonium sulphate, 1.7g l-1yeast nitrogen base, 1.92g l-1yeast synthetic drop-out medium supplement without uracil; Sigma, UK) with 2% glucose (w/v), 2% (w/v) agar (Difco technical) (adjusted to pH 5.3 before addition of agar and prior to autoclaving) (MillsNone, 2010,2012). Plates were incubated at 30 degrees C for 3 d.For metal sensitivity tests, yeast cultures were grown overnight at 30 degrees C in selective liquid medium, SC without uracil (described above). Overnight cultures were centrifuged for 4min at 4000rpm and resuspended in SC galactose liquid medium (pH 5.0) with 2% galactose (w/v) in place of glucose, before further incubation for 4h (30 degrees C, 200rpm) (MillsNone, 2010,2012). Yeast cultures were diluted to the same OD600(~0.4) in SC liquid medium without uracil, 2% (w/v) galactose. Aliquots were inoculated onto SC without uracil, 2% (w/v) agar (Difco technical), 2% (w/v) galactose containing various concentrations of different metals (ZnSO4, CoCl2, FeSO4, CdCl2and MnCl2, Sigma, UK); adjusted to pH 5.3 before addition of agar and prior to autoclaving. Inoculated plates were incubated at 30 degrees C for 4-6 d depending on the growth of yeast colonies. Subcellular localization of wild-type and mutated proteins in yeast was assessed using in-frame C-terminal fusions with GFP in thepAG426-GFPvector (AlbertiNone, 2007). To induce expression of the fusion proteins, yeast cells were pre-grown overnight in SC medium containing glucose to mid-log phase. The cells were switched to SC medium containing galactose and grown for 24h, then were processed for fluorescence microscopy. The GFP fluorescence of yeast was observed using fluorescence microscopy under an Olympus FluoView 1000 confocal laser scanning system. GFP excitation, 488nm; detection, 505-530nm. Images were captured with a high-sensitivity photomultiplier tube detector. Seeds of both T3homozygous lines expressingOsMTP1with a C-terminal GFP tag (line 1 and 2) and the wild type (ecotype Wassilewskija) were surface sterilized in 15% (v/v) bleach for 15min, rinsed five times with sterile water, and inoculated onto plates containing 0.8% (w/v) agarose (Melford), 1% (w/v) sucrose, and 0.5 MS medium (Murashige and Skoog, 1962) as previously described (MillsNone, 2008). Seed were stratified at 4 degrees C for 48h prior to transfer to a controlled-environment cabinet (22 degrees C, 16h light, 110 mumol m-2s-1; 18 degrees C, 8h dark) and plates were incubated vertically for 7 d. Whole seedlings were placed on the slide in water and covered with a cover slide for imaging using an Olympus FluoView 1000 confocal laser scanning system. GFP, propidium iodide (PI), and chlorophyll were excited using the 488nm line of an argon ion laser. GFP and PI emission were detected at 505-530nm and 610-650nm, respectively; chlorophyll autofluorescence was detected using an LP580 filter. Cell wall staining was performed with PI (Invitrogen) using a 19.5 mum solution in water. Plants were immersed in the solution for 5min and rinsed three times with sterile water before analysis. OsMTP1 transmembrane domains were predicted using online helix-prediction programmes TMHMM (KroghNone, 2001) (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/) and Phobius (KallNone, 2004) (http://phobius.sbc.su.se/). The subsequent topology was created according to their predictions. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analyses for MTP1 proteins were performed using the MEGA (Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis) 4.1 package (TamuraNone, 2007). Protein multiple alignments were obtained with ClustalW2, and phylogenetic trees were reconstructed with the Neighbor-Joining method and the following parameters: pairwise deletion option, 1000 replicates of bootstrap, and Poisson correction. The consensus tree shows only branches with a bootstrap consensus greater than 50%. The full-length cDNA fragment ofOsMTP1(accession no. AY266290 /LOC_Os05g03780) was amplified by high-fidelity RT-PCR based on GenBankTM and the Rice Annotation Project information from NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore). It encodes a protein with 418 amino acids. Percentage identities and similarities between OsMTP1, AtMTP1, and HvMTP1 are shown inTable 1. The highest identity (85%) and similarity (90%) scores at the amino acid level were observed between OsMTP1 and HvMTP1. MTP amino acid sequences were searched for in the genomes of six monocotyledons,Sorghum bicolor,Zea mays,Setaria italica,Hordeum vulgare,O. sativa, andBrachypodium distachyon, and a phylogenetic tree includingA. thalianaMTP1 and MTP3 sequences was generated (Fig. 1). In the search, it is clear thatO. sativahas only one MTP1 sequence, whileZ. maysandB. distachyonhave two, indicating that the appearance of new MTP1 sequences occurred after the speciation of each monocot. The multiple sequence alignment of AtMTP1, OsMTP1, and HvMTP1 proteins is shown inFig. 2; positions with a single, fully conserved residue are highlighted, as are those with conserved similar properties. TMDs predicted by Phobius (http://phobius.sbc.su.se/) are also marked inFig. 2. The proteins are predicted to possess cytoplasmic N- and C-termini and six TMDs, with a small cytoplasmic loop between TMDs II and III, and a large cytoplasmic, histidine-rich loop between TMDs IV and V. OsMTP1 possesses the loop with the most histidine residues, followed by HvMTP1. The 17 residues of the CDF signature sequence (MontaniniNone, 2007) are identical for each sequence, and are highlighted inFig. 2. Analyses of protein sequence similarity and identity between AtMTP1, OsMTP1, and HvMTP1. Calculated using the EMBOSS program Matcher. Scores are given as percentage similarity and percentage identity. Accession numbers: AtMTP1, NM130246; OsMTP1, AY266290; HvMTP1, AM286795.

The tree was generated with MEGA 4.1 software. Bootstrap values from 1000 replicates using the Neighbor-Joining method are indicated at each node when the method agrees with the tree topology. Multiple sequence alignment ofOsMTP1,HvMTP1, andAtMTP1generated by the ClustalW2 program. Black with white letters/asterisk, fully conserved residues between sequences; dark grey with white letters/colon, conservation of residues with strongly similar properties; pale grey with black letters/full stop, conservation of residues with weakly similar properties. Transmembrane domains predicted by Phobius are marked by boxes. The CDF signature sequence is underlined. The T-DNA insertion mutant ofA. thaliana(Wassilewskija)mtp1-1is sensitive to elevated Zn, suffering stunted growth and chlorosis compared with the wild type (Fig. 3A). These differences are significant at upward of 100 muM Zn, as indicated by fresh weight and chlorophyll determinations (Fig. 3B). Resistance to Zn is restored whenmtp1-1is transformed withOsMTP1-GFPunder the control of the constitutive 35S promoter. Lines 1 and 2 are homozygous T3lines expressing a C-terminally GFP-tagged version (35S:OsMTP1-GFP:mtp1-1). Similar results were obtained whenOsMTP1without a GFP tag was expressed in themtp1-1mutant (results not shown), indicating that GFP tagging does not interfere with the rescue. This also indicates that the localization of OsMTP1in plantacan be investigated using the GFP-tagged construct. Functional complementation of theArabidopsisknockout mutantmtp1-1byOsMTP1-GFP.

TheOsMTP1-GFP-expressing lines that showed rescue of theArabidopsis mtp1-1mutant phenotype were used to determine the membrane localization of OsMTP1. Confocal images show that OsMTP1 is localized in the vacuolar membrane of plant cells (Fig. 4, upper). Different cells were analysed, including cells in the root tip region containing small immature vacuoles (Fig. 4, upper A), elongated root cells with a large central vacuole (Fig. 4, upper B-D), and cotyledon cells containing chloroplasts (Fig. 4, upper E). All show the same vacuolar localization pattern. OsMTP1 localizes to the vacuole when expressed inArabidopsisand yeast. Upper: (A) OsMTP1 vacuolar membrane localization in theA. thaliana mtp1-1mutant expressingOsMTP1-GFP. The red fluorescence is caused by cell walls stained with propidium iodide (A-D). GFP vacuolar fluorescence (green) in cells of the root tip region, containing small immature vacuoles (A) and in elongated root cells with a large central vacuole (B-D). Scale bar=10 mum. GFP vacuolar fluorescence in cotyledon cells containing chloroplasts (arrow) (E). Scale bar=25 mum. Lower: OsMTP1 localizes to the vacuoles ofzrc1 cot1yeast cells expressingOsMTP1-EGFP, as shown via confocal microscopy. The OsMTP1-EGFP (green) co-localizes with vacuole organelles, which appear as a depression in the DIC image. Scale bar=5 mum. (B) EGFP alone is distributed throughout the cytoplasm. Scale bar=5 mum. In order to study the subcellular localization of OsMTP1, it was cloned into thepAG426-GFPvector, which fuses a GFP tag to the C-terminus of the gene to enable fluorescence localization studies (AlbertiNone, 2007). zrc1 cot1yeast cells expressing theOsMTP1-GFPconstruct were analysed via confocal microscopy which showed that OsMTP1-GFP co-localizes with the vacuoles, which appear as a depression in the differential interference contrast (DIC) image (Fig. 4, lower). The empty vector gives a GFP signal throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 4, lower B). Wild-type and mutantOsMTP1cDNAs were cloned into thepAG426-GFPvector. OsMTP1constructs with and without a stop codon were used so that the activity of OsMTP1 with and without a C-terminal GFP tag could be compared when expressed in yeast using the same expression vector. Only the OsMTP1 without a stop codon (indicated by an asterisk in the figures) should produce the OsMTP1-GFP fusion protein. Having such a tag facilitates localization studies and therefore allowed the evaluation of whether particular mutations had an effect on subcellular localization. Although reducing the transport function slightly, GFP tagging did not change the specificity observed in the metal tolerance tests when compared with the non-tagged OsMTP1 protein. These results suggest that OsMTP1 is functionally active with the GFP tag at the C-terminal region. Mutated versions of OsMTP1 with a C-terminal GFP tag also localized to the vacuole, indicating that any differences observed in transport function are not due to altered localization (Supplementary Fig. S1atJXBonline). The transmembrane data predicted by Phobius and TMHMM were used to construct the hypothetical membrane topology of OsMTP1 inFig. 5A. Seven mutations were tested for their influence on the transport function of OsMTP1 (Fig. 5B). The residues were selected based on conservation between CDF family members and also because mutation of some may confer a gain of function (BlaudezNone, 2003;LinNone, 2009;HochNone, 2012). Figure 5Aalso highlights the substitution sites generated during site-directed mutagenesis, to demonstrate their positions within the protein. (A) Hypothetical membrane topology of OsMTP1 predicted according to the Phobius program. Residues highlighted in black are the sites chosen for OsMTP1 site-directed mutagenesis. EL, extracytosolic loop; IL, intracytosolic loop. (B) Substitutions resulting from site-directed mutations of OsMTP1. Thezrc1 cot1yeast mutant shows both Zn and Co susceptibility because of lack of theZRC1andCOT1genes (Figs 6,7). Heterologous expression ofOsMTP1fully rescues the mutant phenotype at 10mM Zn (Fig. 6). OsMTP1-GFP also shows rescue of the Zn-sensitive phenotype, with slightly decreased growth at 5mM and 10mM Zn compared with the non-tagged OsMTP1, but was as competent at lower concentrations. Compared with OsMTP1-GFP, all of the mutations reduced the rescue of the Zn-sensitive phenotype to some extent, except R149G. This is obvious in L82S and L82F, but most apparent in H90D, which fails to rescue the Zn sensitivity ofzrc1 cot1on 0.25mM Zn (Fig. 6). Functional analysis of OsMTP1 in the Zn-sensitiveSaccharomyces cerevisiaemutantzrc1cot1. BY4741 was transformed withpAG426-GFPempty vector (e.v. ); zrc1 cot1was transformed withpAG426-GFPvector either empty or expressingOsMTP1with or without stop codon (*). The latter generates an OsMTP1-GFP fusion protein. L82S to L317A refer to site-directed substitutions generated withinOsMTP1without a stop codon (*). Numbers represent serial dilutions of yeast cells in liquid SC galactose without uracil: undiluted (1) OD600=0.4, 1:10, and 1:100, sequentially dropped onto and grown on SC galactose without uracil drop-out medium with different concentrations of ZnSO4. Plates were incubated at 28 degrees C for 5 d.In contrast to the results fromYuanNone(2012), it is shown here that OsMTP1 does have Co transport function. OsMTP1 shows partial rescue of Co sensitivity at all concentrations tested (Fig. 7), but wild-type growth is far from being restored. The GFP tag again impacts the rescuing ability of OsMTP1 (Fig. 7). The rescue of the Co-sensitive phenotype is less obvious than that of Zn. L82S again reduces the rescuing ability of OsMTP1, whereas L82F, E145G, R149G, and L317A improve Co transport relative to the non-mutated OsMTP1-GFP construct. Functional analysis of OsMTP1 in the Co-sensitiveSaccharomyces cerevisiaemutantzrc1 cot1. BY4741 was transformed withpAG426-GFPempty vector (e.v. ); zrc1 cot1was transformed withpAG426-GFPvector either empty or expressingOsMTP1with or without a stop codon (*). L82S to L317A refer to site-directed substitutions generated withinOsMTP1without a stop codon (*). Numbers represent serial dilutions of yeast cells in liquid SC galactose without uracil: undiluted (1) OD600=0.4, 1:10, and 1:100, sequentially dropped onto and grown on SC galactose without uracil drop-out medium with different concentrations of CoCl2. Plates were incubated at 28 degrees C for 5 d.The Fe transport-deficientccc1mutant lacks a vacuolar Fe sequestration function, demonstrating an Fe-sensitive phenotype at high Fe. Growth ofccc1transformed with an emptypAG426-GFPvector is inhibited on 5mM Fe compared with the wild type (Fig. 8). OsMTP1 shows rescue ofccc1on 3.5mM (data not shown) and 5mM Fe (Fig. 8), indicating that OsMTP1 can transport iron in yeast. GFP tagging slightly reduces the rescuing ability of OsMTP1 when compared with the non-tagged version of OsMTP1 (Fig. 8). L82F, H90D, and R149G mutations improve Fe transport inccc1. L82S slightly enhances the sensitive phenotype ofccc1, with poorer growth observed compared with OsMTP1-GFP. Functional complementation of the Fe-sensitiveSaccharomyces cerevisiaemutantccc1. DY150 was transformed withpAG426-GFPempty vector (e.v. );ccc1was transformed withpAG426-GFPvector either empty or containingOsMTP1with or without a stop codon (*). L82S to L317A refer to site-directed substitutions generated withinOsMTP1without a stop codon (*). Numbers represent serial dilutions of yeast cells in liquid SC galactose without uracil: undiluted (1) OD600=0.4, 1:10, and 1:100, sequentially dropped onto and grown on SC galactose without uracil drop-out medium with 5mM FeSO4. Plates were incubated at 28 degrees C for 5 d.The Cd-hypersensitiveycf1mutant transformed withOsMTP1clearly confers tolerance to low levels of Cd (Fig. 9), indicating that OsMTP1 can transport Cd in yeast. For all metals tested, expressingOsMTP1-GFPconsistently reduces transport when compared with the non-tagged construct, and on Cd this reduction is very obvious (Fig. 9). As the mutations were performed in theOsMTP1-GFPconstruct, their effects on Cd transport are not conclusive, but it seems that none of the mutations have an effect (Fig. 9). To confirm this, L82F and H90D mutations were tested without GFP tagging, but no difference was noticed inycf1complementation compared with the non-mutated OsMTP1 (data not shown).

This includes the positioning of residues within the protein predicted by Phobius and TMHMM, also highlighted inFig. 2. Summarizing the effects of site-directed mutations on OsMTP1 substrate selectivity. Amino acid substitutions within the OsMTP1 protein and their position relative to predicted transmembrane domains (TMDs) and loops (EL; extracytosolic loop). Zinc- and cobalt-transporting abilities were assayed by complementation ofzrc1cot1cells on ZnSO4and CoCl2; iron-transporting ability was assayed by complementation ofccc1cells on FeSO4; cadmium-transporting ability was assayed by complementation ofycf1cells on CdCl2; and manganese-transporting ability was assayed by complementation ofpmr1cells on MnCl2. x, reduction in growth compared with non-mutated OsMTP1; +, increase in growth; - no difference in growth. All mutations negatively impact Zn transport ability when compared with the non-mutatedOsMTP1-GFPconstruct, except for R149G; this mutation maintains Zn transport levels and enhances Co and Fe transport, but has no effect on Cd and Mn complementation. L82S shows considerable reduction in Zn, Fe, and Co transport ability. A similar reduction in growth was seen for G127S on Zn-containing media, although no further effect was seen on Co, Fe, Cd, and Mn. All other substitutions have no effect on Cd, but enhance transport of Co or Fe: E145G and L317A both show increased survival on Co. The most notable mutations are L82F and H90D. L82F caused considerable reduction in Zn transport, failing to rescuezrc1cot1above 1mM Zn (Fig. 6) but resulting in a considerable increase in both Co and Fe transport and a gain of function for Mn. H90D appears to have abolished Zn transport, with certainly no rescue ofzrc1cot1on or above 0.25mM Zn; the substitution shows enhanced survival on Fe. Expression ofOsMTP1inzrc1 cot1fully rescues the Zn-sen sitive phenotype, suggesting considerable Zn-transporting ability of OsMTP1. Partial rescue ofzrc1 cot1on Co,ccc1on Fe, andycf1on Cd suggests that while OsMTP1 may primarily transport Zn it can also transport Co, Fe, and Cd in yeast. OsMTP1 was also previously shown to transport Ni (YuanNone, 2012). The vacuolar localization observed here in yeast is consistent with OsMTP1 functioning at the tonoplast, compartmentalizing primarily Zn, but also Co, Fe, and Cd in the vacuole, and serving as a detoxification system for excess levels of these metals. When removed from the cytosol, these metals are less damaging and the mutant phenotype is partially or fully rescued. The substrate specificity of OsMTP1 is considerably broader than that of the highly Zn-specific AtMTP1 (KobaeNone, 2004;Desbrosses-FonrougeNone, 2005) and hybrid poplar PtdMTP1 (BlaudezNone, 2003). CDF family members are classified into three major groups (Zn2None, Fe2None/Zn2None, and Mn2None) based on their substrate specificity (MontaniniNone, 2007). OsMTP1 separates phylogenetically with the Zn2Nonegroup, but some members of this group do seem to be capable of transporting other metals. For example, NtMTP1 (ShinguNone, 2005) and HvMTP1 (PodarNone, 2012) have increased Co affinity, while TcMTP1 from the Zn/Cd-hyperaccumulating speciesThlaspi caerulescensalso transports non-essential Ni and Cd (KimNone, 2004). Most of the plant MTP1 members characterized to date have not been tested for Fe transport. Here it is shown that OsMTP1 appears to have some Fe transport activity as it is able to reduce the Fe hypersensitivity of the yeastccc1mutant. ShinguNone(2005)suggested that the broad substrate ability of NgMTP1 from hyperaccumulatingNicotiana glaucamay be attributed to the number of histidine residues in the loop. OsMTP1 possesses more histidine residues in this loop than AtMTP1, but it remains to be tested whether this contributes to the broader substrate selectivity. The present results suggest that OsMTP1 transports Zn when expressed inArabidopsis. Consistent with previous findings, it is shown that theArabidopsis mtp1-1mutant is sensitive to high Zn concentrations (KobaeNone, 2004;KawachiNone, 2009). Just as AtMTP1 under the control of the constitutiveCauliflower mosaic virus(CaMV) 35S promoter can be used to rescue this mutant (KawachiNone, 2009), it is shown that it is also possible with OsMTP1, suggesting conservation of function. OsMTP1-GFP is shown here to localize to the tonoplast inArabidopsis, and it is proposed that OsMTP1 is functioning in transporting Zn into the vacuole, thereby rescuing the Zn hypersensitivity of theArabidopsis mtp1-1mutant. YuanNone(2012)ascribed the localization of OsMTP1 to the plasma membrane, but the present results inArabidopsisand in yeast both support a tonoplast localization, and this is consistent with the vacuolar localization observed for the closely related HvMTP1 from another cereal, barley (PodarNone, 2012). None of the mutations studied here affected targeting, and OsMTP1 localized to the yeast vacuole in all cases. Owing to their reduced or unchanged transporting abilities, G127S and L82S mutants provide little information about selectivity, and loss of function may simply be due to destabilization of the tertiary structure (LinNone, 2009). L82F, however, maintaining the non-polar environment of leucine with phenylalanine, appears to be a gain-of-function mutant; the protein can still transport low levels of Zn, with an enhanced affinity for Fe and Co and with a gain of function for Mn. L82 falls in the first non-cytoplasmic loop at the beginning of the CDF signature sequence (MontaniniNone, 2007). It is equivalent to the L33F mutation that reduces Zn transport but increases Fe and Mn affinity in ScZRC1 (LinNone, 2009). It may, therefore, be concluded that L82 is an important residue for metal selectivity in plant CDFs as well as in homologous yeast transporters. Recent work failed to discover a single substitution that entirely shifts the substrate specificity of AtMTP1 from Zn (KawachiNone, 2012;PodarNone, 2012). It was suggested that CDFs from higher organisms regulate transport specificity more tightly by holding more than one residue responsible for the confinement to specific substrates (PodarNone, 2012). However, it is shown here that the H90D mutation completely abolishes OsMTP1 Zn transport on the lowest concentrations tested (0.25mM) while improving Fe transport. H90, a polar histidine residue, falls within TMD II and the signature CDF sequence of OsMTP1; this residue in AtMTP1 has been proposed to form part of one of the Zn-binding sites (KawachiNone, 2012). This residue has been mutated in CDFs of other organisms: PtdMTP1 (H89K and H89A;BlaudezNone, 2003); AtMTP1 (H90A;KawachiNone, 2012), and in the mammalian metal transporters ZnT5 and ZnT8 (H451D and H106D, respectively;HochNone, 2012). The mutations abolished Zn transport but the effect on transport of other metals was not investigated in all cases. The H90A mutation in AtMTP1 abolishes Zn transport with no apparent rescue of Co tolerance. In ZnT5 and ZnT8, this mutation allows Cd transport and so it was concluded that this motif was important in discriminating between Zn and Cd, (HochNone, 2012). Although this may not be a general feature of CDFs/MTPs, this residue does seem to have a role in selectivity as it enhances Fe transport in OsMTP1. Three further mutations that cause less extreme substrate changes are E145G, R149G, and L317A. E145G is homologous to E97G, a mutation in ScZRC1 that completely shifts the transported substrate from Zn to Fe and Mn (LinNone, 2009). In contrast, the corresponding AtMTP1 mutant just extends its transport ability to Co and Mn (PodarNone, 2012) and to Co and Cd when mutated to the non-polar alanine, E145A (KawachiNone, 2012). In none of the AtMTP1 studies cited above was the effect on Fe hypersensitivity investigated. In contrast to the results with ScZRC1, OsMTP1-E145G continues to transport Zn at a slightly lower level than the non-mutated construct, but with a slight increase in Fe transport and a marked enhancement of Co, demonstrating that this residue can influence OsMTP1 specificity. OsMTP1 containing the R149G mutation does not show a significant difference in Zn tolerance from the wild type; it does, however, enhance Co and Fe tolerance, indicating a distinctive contribution of Arg149 to Zn selectivity over Co and Fe. The homologous mutation in the ScZRC1 protein extends its transport to Fe and Mn (LinNone, 2009). In AtMTP1, mutation of the homologous residue to cysteine, another non-polar amino acid, conferred tolerance to high levels of Co and Cd (KawachiNone, 2012). The leucine-zipper (LZ) motif is conserved in a range of CDF proteins from a number of species. It also appears to be present in OsMTP1, running from L317 to L338 and falling across TMD VI and the C-terminal tail. The OsMTP1 protein containing the L317A mutation continues to transport Zn with slightly lower affinity, while enhancing Co transport. Similarly for AtMTP1, a mutation in L298 (equivalent to L317 in OsMTP1) also has little or no effect in Zn tolerance but conferred Co and Cd gain of function in yeast experiments (KawachiNone, 2012). This suggests that these leucine residues may have a role in ion selectivity that can be explained by AtMTP1 modelling experiments (KawachiNone, 2012). The homologous residue in PtdMTP1, L293, falls at the beginning of the LZ motif. BlaudezNone(2003)serially substituted leucine residues within the motif for alanine, maintaining the non-polar environment but losing the important side chain. These mutations had an increasingly negative effect on the Zn transport ability of PtdMTP1 further along the LZ motif. L293A had little impact, but L314A, the final leucine in the motif, resulted in a severe loss of Zn transport (BlaudezNone, 2003). The last leucine of the LZ motif is highly conserved in the CDF family. In AtMTP1, L319 is essential for protein function, andKawachiNone(2012)suggest that it may form a dimerization contact between two protomers, like L205, the corresponding residue of EcYiiP. This study confirms the importance of L317 in the substrate specificity of OsMTP1, and it would be interesting to perform the same mutation on the successive leucines within the sequence, opening up opportunities to explore the importance of the LZ motif. To conclude, OsMTP1 is a vacuolar transporter that appears to transport Zn, but also Fe, Co, and Cd, perhaps with lower affinity. 35S:OsMTP1:mtp1-1fully rescues the Zn-sensitive phenotype of theArabidopsisknockout mutantmtp1-1,and it would be interesting also to test Co- and Fe-transporting abilitiesin planta. H90 and L82 seem to be important residues for determining the substrate specificity of OsMTP1. Other residues such as E145, R149, and L317 also appear to be related to substrate specificity. These new findings may be useful for defining strategies to generate plants suited for biofortification or phytoremediation applications. Supplementary data are available atJXBonline. Figure S1.
