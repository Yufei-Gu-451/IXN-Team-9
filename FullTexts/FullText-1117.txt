Drought and frost are the two most important abiotic stresses which limit crop production in temperate zones. Since winter cereals have to survive freezing temperatures in winter, the examination of cold acclimation and the development of frost tolerance is a prominent research area. Molecular dissection of this complex, multigenic trait might help to develop more frost-tolerant cereal varieties in the near future. Although cold acclimation is a complex trait and several gene families are involved in this process, the role and the function of the CBF/DREB1 transcription factors have been analysed in the greatest detail in this regard. The 5' region of several cold or dehydration stress-inducible genes contains a 'CCGAC' corecis-motif sequence, the CRT/DRE (C-repeat/dehydration responsive element) (BakerNone., 1994;Yamaguchi-Shinozaki and Shinozaki, 1994). CBF transcription factors belong to the CBF/DREB1 subfamily in the ERF family and AP2/ERF (APETALA2/ethylene-responsive factor) superfamily. As their name, CRT/DRE-binding factor (StockingerNone., 1997;LiuNone., 1998), indicates, they can bind to the promoter of the above-mentioned target genes. CBF proteins are distinguished from the other members of the AP2/ERF protein family by the 'CBF signature' conserved amino acid sequence as well as by the PKK/RPAGRxKFxETRHP and DSAWR motifs present in the N- and C-terminal flanking region, respectively (JagloNone., 2001). CBFgenes are expressed transiently in the early phase of the response to low temperature (StockingerNone., 1997;GilmourNone., 1998). As the temperature decreases, the transcription ofCBFgenes becomes more and more intense (ZarkaNone., 2003). ChinnusamyNone. (2003)identifiedICE1inArabidopsisfirst, and proved that the constitutive overexpression ofICE1indeed inducesCBFtranscription, however only at low temperature, thus enhancing the expression of the CBF regulon and finally increasing frost tolerance. Beside ICE1, it has been shown that many other transcription factors and regulatory genes participate in the temperature-related or circadian/diurnal fine tuning of CBF expression inArabidopsis. Recent reviews summarize our current knowledge on this subject (RuellandNone., 2009;SaiboNone., 2009;ChinnusamyNone., 2010;Thomashow, 2010;MizoiNone., 2012). The function ofCBFgenes has been revealed in many studies in many plant species. InArabidopsis, sixCBFshave been identified, and it has been proved that three of them, namelyCBF1/DREB1B,CBF2/DREB1C, andCBF3/DREB1A, have a primary role in cold acclimation (Jaglo-OttosenNone., 1998;LiuNone., 1998;KasugaNone., 1999;GilmourNone., 2000, 2004;NovilloNone., 2004,2007). Nevertheless, CBF4/DREB1D for example is involved in drought adaptation and it is not induced by low temperature (HaakeNone., 2002). Enhanced frost tolerance and induction ofCORgenes were detected in non-acclimated transgenicArabidopsisthat overexpressed theCBF1gene (Jaglo-OttosenNone., 1998). Beyond increased frost tolerance, the overexpression of theCBF3gene also resulted in improved tolerance to other abiotic (drought, salt) stresses, by the activation of many stress tolerance-related genes even under normal growing conditions in transgenicArabidopsis(LiuNone., 1998;KasugaNone., 1999;GilmourNone., 2000). It has also been shown that CBF2 is a negative regulator ofCBF1andCBF3, suggesting an autoregulaton mechanism (NovilloNone., 2004). In cereals, most information on CBF pathways is available from experiments carried out in barley (Hordeum vulgareL.) and wheat (diploid einkorn wheat,Triticum monococcum; and bread hexaploid wheat,Triticum aestivumL.), and the results from these two species confirm and complement each other. Similarly toArabidopsis,ICE1-like genes, namelyTaICE41andTaICE87, were found in wheat as inducers ofCBFgenes under cold stress (BadawiNone., 2008). Potential downstream target genes participating in the CBF regulon have been analysed in some studies. CRT motifs or DRE-like elements have been found in the promoter of several cold-regulated or drought-inducible genes inTriticeae(reviewed byCattivelliNone., 2002); among them areHVA1(StraubNone., 1994),DHN5(CloseNone., 1995),DHN8(ChoiNone., 1999, 2000), andCOR14b(CrosattiNone., 1996) in barley, andWCS120(Vazquez-TelloNone., 1998) in wheat. Other than inArabidopsis, theCBFgenes have been identified and characterized in the greatest detail in cereals. At least 20 and 11CBFgenes were mapped and characterized around theFR2(Frost Resistance 2) locus in barley (SkinnerNone., 2005,2006;TondelliNone., 2006;FranciaNone., 2007) andT. monococcum(MillerNone., 2006), respectively. To aid comparative analysis, a common gene numbering system was elaborated for the homeologue genes bySkinnerNone. (2005)and byMillerNone. (2006). Considering the great numbers ofCBFgenes encoded in cereal genomes, several experiments have aimed to study the function of individual genes. SkinnerNone. (2005)characterized the complex barleyCBFgene family using structural, functional, and phylogenetic approaches. Expression analyses inTriticeaeshowed thatCBFgenes are regulated in a complex way, influenced by genotype, induction temperature, and light-regulated factors (CampoliNone., 2009). Multiplatform candidate gene-based association analysis of 201 rye (Secale cerealeL.) genotypes showed that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) inScCBF15andScCBF12genes were significantly associated with frost tolerance (LiNone., 2011). By crossing the frost-tolerant G3116 with the frost-sensitive DV92 diploid wheat genotypes, a mapping population was generated (MillerNone., 2006) and subjected to frost tests (KnoxNone., 2008). It was shown that threeCBFgenes (TmCBF12,TmCBF14, andTmCBF15) were responsible for the improved frost tolerance and this was related to higher expression levels ofCOR14bandDHN5genes (KnoxNone., 2008). It has been also proved by gene expression studies that threeCBFgenes,TaCBF14,TaCBF15, andTaCBF16, are induced by cold treatment in hexaploid wheat, and also that their enhanced expression is correlated with the level of frost tolerance (VagujfalviNone., 2005). The results of the two aforementioned studies overlap since they highlighted that twoCBFs(CBF14andCBF15) are among those that most effectively participate in the development of frost tolerance. A comparative transcriptome analysis was carried out bySuttonNone. (2009)using two winter wheat genotypes with different levels of frost tolerance. Six wheatCBFs-among themCBF14-were found to be differentially expressed in the cold-acclimated winter wheat lines relative to the non-acclimated controls, thus suggesting a possible gain-of-function mutation that leads to an increased level of frost tolerance. These mutations are considered as potential markers for frost survival (SuttonNone., 2009). The association analysis between genetic variants ofCBFgenes and freezing tolerance revealed that two nucleotide substitutions ofHvCBF14are statistically associated with freezing tolerance in barley. It was concluded thatHvCBF14is associated with frost tolerance in a large European barley germplasm collection, suggesting that there is some degree of specificity among the differentCBFs, and thatHvCBF14is the most relevant one for frost tolerance (FricanoNone., 2009). In addition, experiments indicate that the original copy number of a givenCBFin the genome is also a deciding factor in the level of low temperature tolerance (KnoxNone., 2010). The function ofCBFgenes of temperate cereals has been tested by transformation methods in a few experiments. Overexpression of the wheatCBF2gene led to improved frost tolerance and enhanced expression of downstream genes in transgenic tobacco (TakumiNone., 2008). The barleyHvCBF4gene was overexpressed in transgenic rice and resulted in increased tolerance to low temperature, drought, and high salinity (OhNone., 2007). In contrast, in a different rice cultivar, theHvCBF4transgene caused enhanced survival to drought, but not to high salinity or cold stress (LourencoNone., 2011). Besides the enhanced tolerance to abiotic stresses, pleiotropic effects of the constitutively expressedCBFtransgene were described in several studies. Retarded development, slower growth, and late flowering were observed in different transgenic plant species (LiuNone., 1998;KasugaNone., 1999;GilmourNone., 2004;ItoNone., 2006;LourencoNone., 2011). These effects were eliminated or reduced by using an inducible promoter for the regulation of the transgene (KasugaNone., 1999;HsiehNone., 2002;LeeNone., 2003). However several counter-examples show that the constitutive expression of theCBFtransgene did not result in growth retardation (Jaglo-OttosenNone., 1998;OhNone., 2005, 2007;WangNone., 2008). A likely explanation of the pleiotropic effect of the overexpression ofCBFin transgenic plants was published byAchardNone. (2008). They found that AtCBF1 enhances the accumulation of the growth-repressing DELLA proteins through the alteration of gibberellin (GA) metabolism. DELLA proteins are a small family of growth-repressing proteins, participating in the GA signalling pathway. Bioactive GA synthesis is catalysed by GA 20-oxidase (GA20ox) and GA 3-oxidase (GA3ox), while the bioactive GAs are inactivated by the GA 2-oxidase enzyme (GA2ox) (for a review, seeYamaguchi, 2008). Accumulation of DELLAs, in parallel with bioactive GA degradation and plant growth retardation, contributes significantly to the cold acclimation process (Achard and Genschik, 2009). TwoCBFgenes have been detected with prominent roles in the frost tolerance of wheat in earlier studies:CBF14andCBF15(VagujfalviNone., 2005;KnoxNone., 2008). In the current work these candidate genes were isolated from winter wheat and overexpressed in spring barley. The effect of the transgenes on the stress adaptation was analysed in response to low and freezing temperatures. The cDNA of the cold-induced winter wheat (T. aestivumssp. aestivum) variety 'Cheyenne' was transcribed by means of reverse transcription (M-MLV RT, Promega) from RNA (TRIzol(r)Reagent, Invitrogen) treated with DNase I (Promega). From the cDNA,TaCBF14(accession no. EU076382) andTaCBF15(accession no. EU076383) genes were amplified (AccuprimeTM Pfx DNA polymerase, Invitrogen) using a primer pair including the 4bp sequences (CACC) necessary for directional cloning on the 5' end of the forward primer (TopoCBF14 forward primer 5'-CACCTAATTACCCCACAGTCG-3', TopoCBF14 reverse primer 5'-TGCTTAGTCGAACAAGTAGCTC-3'; TopoCBF15 forward primer 5'-CACCTAACCAACACTCCTCAG-3', TopoCBF15 reverse primer 5'-AGCTGGCTGGAGTGTTTTAGTA-3'). These fragments were cloned into the pENTRTM/D-TOPO(r)(Invitrogen) Gateway-based cloning vector, followed by an LR recombination reaction between the cloning (donor) vectors and the pBract214 binary recipient vector (http://www.bract.org/constructs.htm#barley), in which thehptselectable marker gene (encodes hygromycin phosphotransferase) confers resistance to the antibiotic hygromycin B, and the maize ubiquitin promoter+intron (Ubi1) ensures the constitutive expression of the transgene (seeSupplementary Fig. S1A-Davailable atJXBonline). Validation of the pBract214-TaCBF14and pBract214-TaCBF15constructs was carried out by means of PCR, digestion with restriction enzymes (BamHI andSacI; Fermentas), and sequencing (BRC, DNA Sequencing Laboratory, Szeged, Hungary); then they were transformed into theAgrobacterium tumefaciensstrain AGL1. Immature embryos of the spring barley (H. vulgareL.) cultivar 'Golden Promise' (GP) were transformed by the method ofBartlettNone. (2008)andHarwoodNone. (2009)withA. tumefaciensstrain AGL1 carrying the binary vector pBract214-TaCBF14or pBract214-TaCBF15. Transformation was also carried out with the pBract202 vector (carrying only thehptselectable marker gene), producing transgenic control plants. Plant genomic DNA was extracted from the leaves of the regenerated lines (DNeasy Plant Mini Kit; Qiagen). Transgenic plants were verified by PCR with the above-mentioned TopoCBF primers and with specific primers which can bind to the selectable marker genehpt: HygF 5'-ACTCACCGCGACGTCTGTC-3'; HygR 5'-GCGCGTCTGCTGCTCCAT-3' (StanleyNone., 2011). The forward primer on the ubiquitin promoter is: pAH Ubi_promD primer forward 5'-GCATATGCAGCAGCTATATGTG-3'; and the reverse primer on the NOS terminator is nosterm_3' reverse primer: 5'-GATATCAGCTTGCATGCCGGTC-3'. The determination of transgene copy number in the T0and T1generation was carried out at IDNA Genetics Limited, UK, using quantitative real-time PCR with primers and probes specific for the hygromycin gene. In the T1generation, copy number analysis was used to determine whether the transgene was inherited in the homozygous or heterozygous state in the progeny plants. Frost tests were performed according to Vagujfalviet al. (2003). After 3 weeks of preliminary growth under control conditions (17/13 degrees C day/night temperature, 16h illumination, 240 umol m-2s-1light intensity, 75% relative humidity), the plants were cold hardened for 3 weeks at 4 degrees C (under the same illumination conditions). In the case of frost testing without cold hardening, plants grown under control conditions were subjected to the frost directly. Hardened plants were frozen at -11 degrees C and -13 degrees C, while the non-hardened plants were treated at -6 degrees C. Twenty individual plants were evaluated for each line in the experiments. Frost damage to the plants was scored directly on the basis of rate of recovery (scoring). It was evaluated 1 and 2 weeks after frost on a scale ranging from 0 (perished by cold) to 5 (no frost damage). The survival percentage for each line was calculated as the ratio of surviving plants to the number of plants subjected to freezing temperature. Fluorescence induction parameters (Fv/Fmratio andF0) were determined in leaves with a pulse amplitude-modulated fluorometer (PAM 2000, Walz, Effeltrich) to evaluate the increased cold acclimation capability and frost tolerance (RizzaNone., 2001). Conductance measurements were taken on leaf tissue subjected to frost; a 3cm segment of the green, photosynthetic leaf tissue was used. Samples were taken from 10 plants for each line and put into 15ml Falcon tubes with 5ml of MQ water. They were shaken overnight at 300rpm before recording the conductivity with an electrical conductivity meter (Mikro KKT). Then they were autoclaved for 20min, and cooled to room temperature before measuring the total potential conductivity. Values were adjusted by subtracting the conductivity of the deionized water. Relative conductivity of frost-treated samples represents the adjusted mean ion leakage as a percentage of the total adjusted leakage after boiling. These parameters were measured at the end of the hardening period, immediately after the freezing temperature, as well as 24h and 48h after freezing on 10 plants for each line. Samples for gene expression studies were taken under control conditions (17/13 degrees C day/night temperature, 16h illumination, 240 umol m-2s-1light intensity, 75% relative humidity) and after 24h cold treatment at 4 degrees C. In both cases, lighting was switched on at 08:00h, and the samples were collected at 09:30h (i.e. after 90min illumination). Samples from five plants were pooled and homogenized. Total RNA from leaves was extracted with TRIzol(r)Reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturers instructions. 1 ug aliquot of RNA samples was reverse transcribed using M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Promega) with oligo(dT)15primer (Promega). The expression level of the transgene and a number of target genes was determined by means of real-time PCR (ABI 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR instrument, Applied Biosystems) using Brilliant(r)II SYBR(r)Green QPCR Master Mix (Stratagene). The relative fold change (FC) values were calculated with the DeltaDeltaCt method (Bookout and Mangelsdorf, 2003). The sequences of the quantitative PCR primers are listed inTable 1. The primer pairs (Fwd, forward primer; Rev, reverse primer) of the genes for quantitative RT-PCR. The statistical evaluation of the data was performed with the SPSS statistical program package version 16.0. Outliers were eliminated (alpha=0.05). The normality of the data sets was checked with Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and the equality of variances using Levene's test. Pairwise comparison (transgenic lines compared with the wild type) was performed applying the least significant difference (LSD) method when the variances were homogeneous, while the Tamhane test was used to find significant differences between the lines if the variances were unequal. t-test was used to compare two measuring points. For the plant transformation, the coding regions of the candidateTaCBF14andTaCBF15genes were cloned into pBract214 vector, developed for overexpression in cereals. Immature barley embryos were transformed using constructs pBract214-TaCBF14and pBract214-TaCBF15. Moreover, a control empty vector, pBract202, carrying only thehptselectable marker gene, was used to produce hygromycin-resistant transgenic control plants. The transformation efficiency is summarized inTable 2. Only the plants which originated from different calli were considered as independent transgenic lines. The integration of the transgene was demonstrated by PCR (seeSupplementary Fig. S2A, BatJXBonline); all of the candidate transgenic lines proved to be PCR positive in the T0generation. The transgene copy number was determined too; plants with low copy number (2-4) and in most cases with a single transgene copy were produced (seeSupplementary Table S1). Summary of the transformation experiments showing transformation efficiencies, defined as the number of independent transformed plants as a percentage of the number of immature embryos treated (BartlettNone. 2008;HarwoodNone., 2009). In the transformants, the transgene is regulated by the ubiquitin promoter, which ensures strong constitutive expression. Samples were thus taken under control conditions to demonstrate the function of the transgene (seeSupplementary Fig. S3A, BatJXBonline). Accordingly, the expression level of the transgene was shown by quantitative RT-PCR in all the independent lines of the T0generation (seeSupplementary Fig. S4A, B). When T0plants were regenerated successively from tissue culture, differences in the phenotype between the transformants and GP could not be discerned. It was observed in the T1and T2progeny that the majority of the lines overexpressing theTaCBF14andTaCBF15genes exhibited moderately retarded development (seeSupplementary Fig. S5A, BatJXBonline), slower growth, and slightly later flowering compared with the wild type under normal plant growth conditions (Fig. 1). Table 3shows the time of heading based on the Zadoks scale (ZadoksNone., 1974;Murray and Robertson, 2003). Lines CBF14_L8, CBF15_L1, and CBF15_L6 were the most delayed in their development; they entered into the heading phase 2-3 weeks later than the wild type. The transgenic control line eared at the same time as the wild type, and no difference was observed in the course of their development. The development of the barley lines in the period of flowering (89-14 d after germination) is shown based on the Zadoks scale (ZadoksNone., 1974;Murray and Robertson, 2003). GP, Golden Promise wild-type barley; TC_L1, transgenic control line; CBF14_L4-L10, TaCBF14 transgenic lines; CBF15_L1-L14, TaCBF15 transgenic lines. Numbers on the scale indicate: 39, flag leaf collar just visible; 41, flag leaf sheath extending; 45, boots just swollen; 47, flag leaf sheath opening; 53, a quarter of inflorescence emerged; 55, half of inflorescence emerged; 57, three-quarters of inflorescence emerged; 59, emergence of inflorescence completed; 73, early milk; 77, late milk. Transgenic lines [CBF14_L10 (A) and CBF15_L1 (B)] show moderate retarded development, slower growth, and slightly later flowering compared with the wild-type Golden Promise (GP). In order to select the most tolerantTaCBFtransgenic barley lines, all 28 independent transformants and one transgenic control line were tested for frost tolerance and compared with wild-type GP barley. After a 3 week long hardening phase at 4 degrees C, freezing temperatures of -11 degrees C and -13 degrees C were applied in the first frost tests on the T1generation. Some of the transformants survived even at the lower freezing temperature. To confirm the results, the frost test at -13 degrees C was repeated in a second experiment. The most resistant lines were identified on the basis of rate of recovery (scoring), survival percentage, chlorophyll fluorescence measurements, and conductance tests (Table 4). Based on their overall performance, the best lines were selected for further analyses (indicated by bold type inTable 4). In the homozygous T2generation, these lines were tested at -11 degrees C and -13 degrees C. Judging by the conductance measurements, the leaves of the transformants were less severely injured by freezing than those of the wild type (seeSupplementary Table S2atJXBonline). TheFv/Fmvalues were significantly higher in the leaves of transgenic plants, indicating less damage to photosystem II (PSII) (seeSupplementary Table S3). The six selectedTaCBF14transformants and line CBF15_L1 also proved to be more frost resistant than wild-type GP on the basis of survival percentage (Fig. 2) and rate of recovery (seeSupplementary Fig. S6A, B). The otherTaCBF15transformants tested exhibited a slight increase in frost tolerance. The results obtained in the homozygous T2generation showed bigger differences between the wild type and transgenic lines than those recorded in frost tests on the T1generation, and the differences compared with the wild type were more pronounced.

As theTaCBF14andTaCBF15transgenes are constitutively expressed, frost tests were also performed on the selected lines without a preliminary hardening period. Treatment at -6 degrees C was lethal for the wild type, while the transgenic lines exhibited a low percentage of regeneration after freezing (Table 5). In this experiment, lines CBF14_L10 and CBF15_L1 proved to have the best frost tolerance.

The expression levels of some genes belonging to the late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) protein group, and several cold-inducible barleyCBFgenes were tested in control and cold-treated samples of wild-type GP and three selected lines each from TaCBF14 and TaCBF15 transgenics (T3progeny), which proved to be most resistant in previous physiological tests. Also the expression level of the transgene was analysed in the samples (Fig. 3). Primer pairs were designed for theTaCBFtransgenes (Table 1), and were also tested on the wild-type barley samples. CBFtranscript was not detectable in the control GP samples with these primers. However, after cold treatment, those primers could amplify some transcript with low efficiency. This expression level was orders of magnitude lower than detected in transgenics, so these values are simply not visible on Fig. 3. The expression of theTaCBF14orTaCBF15transgene was enhanced after cold treatment in the CBF14 lines and in CBF15_L1. However, cold-induced transgene expression changes were not detected in the two further CBF15 transgenics (L6 and L14) examined. Relative expression of theTaCBF14(A) andTaCBF15(B) transgene is shown in control and 1 d cold-treated transgenic barley lines. The fold change (FC) values of control samples CBF14_L4 and CBF15_L1 were assigned as 1. Exogenous barleyCBFexpression was detected in wild-type Golden Promise (GP) after cold; the value was FC=0.000352 in the case of the TaCBF14 primer pair, and FC=0.000033 in the case of the TaCBF15 primer pair. UD, undetectable. The expression levels of the cold-inducible barleyHvCBF1,HvCBF6, andHvCBF9genes were also analysed in the same set of transgenics (Fig. 4). The FC value of the GP control sample was assigned as 1. HvCBF1(Fig. 4A) andHvCBF9(Fig. 4C) were expressed to the same extent under control conditions in all the lines tested. After cold treatment it was established that these genes were induced strongly in GP. On the other hand, the level of cold induction of these genes was not so high in the majority of the transgenic lines. In the case ofHvCBF6(Fig. 4B), a similar phenomenon was not observed, except in the line CBF14_L4 where the FC values of cold-treated transgenic samples were lower than in the wild type. The expression level ofHvCBF6was less than half in the control samples of CBF14_L4 and CBF15_L6 lines, and only one-fifth of the FC value of the wild-type control sample was measured in CBF14_L10 and in CBF15_L1. Expression analysis of other barleyCBFgenes, namelyHvCBF2A,HvCBF3,HvCBF10A,HvCBF11,HvCBF14,HvCBF15, andHvCBF16(using the primer pairs reported and the sequences kindly provided byMorranNone., 2011), was carried out on the two best transgenic lines (CBF14_L10 and CBF15_L1) and compared with wild-type GP; however, differences were not detected between the lines (data not shown). Expression ofHvCBF1(A),HvCBF6(B), andHvCBF9(C) genes is shown in the graph in control and 1 d cold-treated samples of three transgenic (TaCBF14 and TaCBF15) barley lines compared with the wild-type Golden Promise (GP). The fold change (FC) value of the GP control sample was assigned as 1. One of the largest groups of genes induced by drought, cold and salt stress consists of the LEA proteins (Ingram and Bartels, 1996;Thomashow, 1999). The relative expression of three genes belonging to the LEA protein group was analysed on the above-mentioned lines (Fig. 5). TheHvCOR14bgene was induced in the wild type only by cold treatment, while in the transgenic lines its expression was improved in control conditions too and it was enhanced more by cold stress (Fig. 5A). Also the expression of theHvDHN5gene was greater (50- to 100-fold) in transgenic lines than in GP in control conditions (Fig. 5B). In CBF14_L10 and CBF15_L1, 10 times greaterHvDHN8expression was recorded under control conditions than in GP (Fig. 5C). After cold treatment, this gene was more highly expressed in CBF14_L4 and CBF14_L10. Expression ofHvCOR14b(A),HvDHN5(B), andHvDHN8(C) genes is shown in the graph in control and 1 d cold-treated samples of three transgenic (TaCBF14 and TaCBF15) barley lines compared with the wild-type Golden Promise (GP). The fold change (FC) value of the GP control sample was assigned as 1. Because of the possible effect of TaCBF14 and TaCBF15 transcription factors on GA metabolism, using the most tolerant transgenic lines and the wild-type GP, the expression of some genes which encode enzymes that have roles in the later steps of the GA biosynthetic pathway was analysed. In GP,HvGA20ox1andHvGA20ox3genes were induced after cold treatment to a small degree; their expression was 2-fold that measured in control samples. The expression levels of these genes were similar in the transgenic lines (seeSupplementary Fig. S7A, BatJXBonline). Differences between the lines and GP wild type were not detected in the expression level ofHvGA2ox4andHvGA2ox5genes in control conditions (Fig. 6). After 1 d cold treatment, the transcript levels of the bioactive GA-inactivatingHvGA2oxgenes were enhanced in the samples. The most conspicuous changes were detected in the expression of theHvGA2ox5gene (Fig. 6B) after 1 d cold treatment; this gene was greatly induced in the transgenics compared with the wild type. Expression ofHvGA2ox4(A) andHvGA2ox5(B) genes is shown in the graph in control and 1 d cold-treated samples of the most tolerant transgenic lines compared with the wild-type Golden Promise (GP). The fold change (FC) value of the GP control sample was assigned as 1. As mentioned in the Introduction, previous work by the authors and several further studies have highlighted that two CBF transcription factors have an outstanding role in the development of frost tolerance in wheat. The aim of the current study was to confirm the function of these TaCBF14 and TaCBF15 transcription factors directly by transformation of an economically important cereal. These genes were isolated from winter wheat (T. aestivumL. Cheyenne) and the GP spring barley genotype was transformed with them. It was expected that the level of frost tolerance of the recipient plants would be improved by the constitutive overexpression of these candidate genes. Preliminary test results showed that the wild-type GP spring barley was killed at -10 degrees C to -11 degrees C with a 3 week cold hardening phase (SolteszNone., 2012), and at -5 degrees C without a hardening period (unpublished data) in the frost test system. Because the examined CBF transcription factors were expected to enhance frost tolerance, the transgenic lines were tested at -11 degrees C and -13 degrees C after a period of 3 weeks hardening or at -6 degrees C without hardening. Conductance studies demonstrated that the leaves of transgenics suffered less severe damage from frost than those of the wild type. Significantly higherFv/Fmvalues were recorded in the leaves of the transgenics, suggesting that the PSII system was functioning more efficiently in them. Six transgenic TaCBF14 lines and the CBF15_L1 line proved to be more frost resistant than the wild type, and the remainder of the TaCBF15 transgenic lines exhibited a slight increase in frost tolerance. These experiments proved that the TaCBF14 and TaCBF15 transcription factors play an important role in the development of frost tolerance to such an extent that the transgenic lines were able to survive freezing temperatures several degrees lower than that which proved lethal for the wild-type GP. Similar experimental procedures were carried out byMorranNone. (2011)when wheatTaDREB2andTaDREB3genes-which are related to CBF/DREB1-type transcription factors-were overexpressed in GP spring barley. Three-week-old transgenic plants showed a 25-55% survival compared with the wild type after a short -6 degrees C frost treatment, carried out without a hardening period. The function of the transgenes was checked under control conditions and after 1 d cold treatment in the selected transgenic lines (T3generation) based on frost tests. Cold-induced gene expression enhancement was observed in TaCBF14 lines and in TaCBF15_L1, even though a constitutive-maize ubiquitin (Ubi1)-promoter was used to regulate the transgene. It was already reported byChristensen and Quail (1996) that this promoter is both thermal and mechanical stress inducible in transgenic rice. Most probably theUbi1promoter is also cold induced in barley and/or its efficiency may be affected by the transgene integration site. Because of the high homology of the wheat and barleyCBFgenes, the primers designed for transgene expression measurements were also tested on the wild-type barley. CBFgene expression of the wild-type GP was not detectable under control conditions, although after cold treatment the primers could amplify some transcript at a low level. It is possible that the detected increased transgene expression in the transgenic lines is derived from the co-amplification of the cold-induced exogenous barleyCBFgenes. However, in CBF15_L6 and CBF15_L14, the transgene was expressed constitutively at the same level during the experiment. Because independent transformation events were examined, the genomic background of the integrated copies, the chromatin structure, and nearby enhancer or silencer sequences could be modulating the function of the promoter in independent transgenic lines transformed with the same construct. The data provided here also show that the ectopic expression ofTaCBF14andTaCBF15influences the function of genes known to play a role in cold hardening or in the development of frost resistance in barley. Changes were detected in the expression of certain genes belonging to the CBF regulon. The greatest effect was seen for theHvCOR14bgene, which is induced normally by low temperature stress (CrosattiNone., 1996,1999,2003,2008;GiorniNone., 1999). The enhanced transcript level of theCOR14bgene is widely used to prove the effectiveness of cold treatment in cereals (KnoxNone., 2008;DhillonNone., 2010). It was found that the constitutive expression of theTaCBF14andTaCBF15transgenes induced the transcription ofHvCOR14bin the transgenic barley lines even under control conditions (i.e. without cold treatment); the expression approached the level found after cold treatment in the wild type. MorranNone. (2011)observed similarly intenseHvCOR14bexpression in TaDREB3 GP transformants. BesideCOR, many other stress-related genes also play an important role in the cold adaptation process and in the development of frost tolerance (for a review inArabidopsis, seeThomashow, 1999; for wheat, seeWinfieldNone., 2010). In response to cold, the function of dehydrins in cereals is summarized byKosovaNone. (2007). The accumulation of the cryoprotective HvDHN5 (BravoNone., 2003), a homologue of the wheat cold-regulated WCS120, in barley was found to be associated with the induction of frost tolerance (Bravoet al., 1999), and this protein was shown to be accumulated at higher levels in the frost-tolerant genotype than in the sensitive genotype (ZhuNone., 2000). The present results show thatHvDHN5is up-regulated under control conditions in the TaCBF14 and TaCBF15 transgenic spring barley lines. Another dehydrin gene, namelyHvDHN8, is a homologue of the wheatWCOR410gene (ZhuNone., 2000). The cold induction ofHvDHN8is slower (detectable only after 4 d at 4 degrees C) than that ofHvDHN5(highly expressed after 12h at 4 degrees C), and, in addition its expression level is lower (ZhuNone., 2000). In the present experiments, enhanced expression ofHvDHN8was found under control conditions in some transgenic lines; however, its level was lower than in the case ofHvDHN5. After 1 d cold treatmentHvDHN8was induced 10-fold in the wild type, while larger increases in gene expression (40-fold and 50-fold) were detected in two TaCBF14 transgenic lines. The frost tests and the gene expression analysis prove that theTaCBF14andTaCBF15genes investigated influence the development of frost tolerance by regulating theHvCOR14b,HvDHN5, andHvDHN8genes. The data also indicate that the TaCBF14 transcription factor has a larger effect on the development of frost tolerance in transgenic barley than TaCBF15. InArabidopsisit was demonstrated that AtCBF2 is a negative regulator of AtCBF1 and AtCBF3 (NovilloNone., 2004); on the other hand, AtCBF1 and AtCBF3 cannot regulate AtCBF2 (NovilloNone., 2007). The transgenic plants used here provided an opportunity to study whether the overexpression of aCBFtransgene has any effect on the host-specific (barley-encoded)CBFgene expression. Accordingly, the expression of the cold-inducible barleyHvCBFswas analysed in the transgenic material. TheHvCBF1andHvCBF9genes were induced to a lesser extent in the TaCBF14 and TaCBF15 lines in response to cold treatment than GP. However, compared with the wild type, differences in the cold-induced gene expression for other barleyCBFswere not detected in the transgenic lines. These results suggest a possible self-regulation system in theCBF/DREBgene family in barley. The identification ofcis-acting or CRT/DRE elements in the promoter region of CBF/DREB genes could predict possible autoregulation sites and mechanisms in the ERF family. To the authors' knowledge, there are few published data available on this subject in the cereals. Sequence analysis suggests that theHvCBF3gene may not have an autoregulation role (ChoiNone., 2002). As experienced in CBF transformation experiments with different plant species (LiuNone., 1998;KasugaNone., 1999;GilmourNone., 2004;ItoNone., 2006;OhNone., 2007), some of the barley transgenic plants, overexpressing the TaCBF14 and TaCBF15 transcription factors, also showed retarded development, a slower growth rate, and delayed flowering. AchardNone. (2008)found the accumulation of DELLA proteins in lines with increased expression of GA-inactivatingGA2oxgenes in transgenic plants that constitutively overexpressed theArabidopsis CBF1/DREB1bgene. DELLA accumulation was associated with enhanced frost tolerance (AchardNone., 2008). In the present experiments, enhanced transcript levels of theHvGA2ox5gene were detected in cold-treated TaCBF14 and TaCBF15 transgenic barley lines. Probably the overproduction of theTaCBF14andTaCBF15genes causes the inactivation of bioactive GAs and the accumulation of DELLA protein. Experiments at the protein level are necessary to elucidate fully the processes in cereals. The new germplasm developed in the present work was selected after repeated frost tests. These transgenic lines are considered valuable materials for further molecular analysis. Currently, the crossing of the best TaCBF14 and TaCBF15 lines is under way. The transcriptome changes caused by theTaCBF14andTaCBF15transgenes will also be clarified by cDNA microarray analysis. These lines could be used in future experiments aimed at determining the function of the CBF14 versus CBF15 regulon. Supplementary data are available atJXBonline. Figure S1.
