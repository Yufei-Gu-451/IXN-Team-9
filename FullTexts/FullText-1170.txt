In flowering plants, male gametophyte (pollen) development is a complicated biological process. It takes place in the anther locules and comprises two essential phases: microsporogenesis and microgametogenesis (BorgNone, 2009). The mature pollen grain of maize (Zea mays) consists of three cells: two small sperm cells and a larger vegetative cell. After the pollen grain arrives at the compatible stigmatic hairs of maize silk, it hydrates. The pollen tube then starts to elongate in the style, which connects the stigma to the embryo sac. Ultimately, the sperm cells are delivered into the embryo sac of an ovule to achieve double fertilization. One sperm cell fuses with the egg cell, giving rise to the zygote, while the other one fuses with the central cell and develops into the primary endosperm (Mascarenhas, 1990;Taylor and Hepler, 1997). Processes that control pollen germination and tube growth involve multiple signal transduction molecules, including Ca2+(Holdaway-Clarke and Hepler, 2003), calmodulin (CaM;MoutinhoNone, 1998), phosphoinositides (MoutinhoNone, 2001), and GTPase (CheungNone, 2002). These modulate vesicle targeting and the physical state of the actin cytoskeleton required for tube elongation (MillerNone, 1996). The actin cytoskeleton is a highly organized dynamic structure that plays prominent roles in pollen germination and tube growth. Specific roles include organelle positioning (KadotaNone, 2009), cytoplasmic streaming (CardenasNone, 2005), vesicle trafficking (KimNone, 2005), and polar growth (VidaliNone, 2001). Various actin-binding proteins (ABPs) are involved in the regulation of actin dynamics, and these have the ability to bind to actin monomer and/or actin filaments (HigakiNone, 2007). ABPs regulate actin dynamics by maintaining the steady-state equilibrium between actin monomers and actin filaments (StaigerNone, 2010). In flowering plants, a subset of ABPs has been characterized from pollen (LopezNone, 1996;StaigerNone, 1997), and includes actin-depolymerizing factors (ADFs) and profilins; these have similar or opposite effects on actin dynamics. ADFs bind to actin monomers and filaments, and preferentially depolymerize actin filaments by a complex mechanism. Increased levels of ADF in pollen tubes inhibit pollen tube growth and disrupt the actin cytoskeleton (ChenNone, 2002). Profilins are actin monomer-binding proteins that are able to regulate actin nucleation, causing either actin polymerization or depolymerization (PerelroizenNone, 1996;KangNone, 1999). Profilins, whose activity is dependent on the Ca2+concentration, are distributed throughout the pollen tube (KovarNone, 2000). Five profilins have been identified in the maize PRO family (ZmPRO1-ZmPRO5). Of these, theZmPRO1,2,and3genes are highly expressed in pollen (StaigerNone, 1993;GibbonNone, 1998;KovarNone, 2000). Additionally, profilin can bind to polyphosphoinositides, poly-l-proline (PLP), proline-rich proteins, and several multiprotein complexes to regulate actin nucleation (FedorovNone, 1994;ReinhardNone, 1995;MahoneyNone, 1999). Formins are a class of profilin-interactng proteins, which are a primary actin filament nucleation factors, and comprise two formin-homology domains, FH1 and FH2. The FH1 domain contains a proline-rich stretch which interacts with profilin and profilin-actin (KovarNone, 2006). The FH2 domain is necessary for actin filament nucleation (Zigmond, 2004). In recent years, it has been reported that a novel class of small peptide genes are involved in plant morphogenesis processes, including organ growth and development. They contain one or more short open reading frames (sORFs) of less than 100 amino acid residues that are able to translate small peptides (KastenmayerNone, 2006). An increasing number of sORFs have been demonstrated to function as significant regulators in the control of cell proliferation, cell differentiation, and signal transduction in plants. For example, in theArabidopsismutant,inflorescence deficient in abscission(ida), the floral organs delay abscission after the shedding of mature seeds. This is because IDA is a ligand for the leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase HAESA, which influences floral organ abscission. IDAencodes a 77 amino acid protein with an N-terminal hydrophobic region, and is localized to the plasma membrane (ButenkoNone, 2003). InArabidopsis,CLAVATA3(CLV3) encodes a 96 amino acid peptide with an 18 amino acid secretory signal peptide at the N-terminus. It has been reported that theclv3floral meristem is larger than that of the wild type, and forms a large mass of additional carpels, thus confirming thatCLV3is a specific regulator in the coordination of cell differentiation and proliferation at the floral meristem throughout flower development (ClarkNone, 1995;FletcherNone, 1999). In addition to these, phytosulphokine-alpha (PSK-alpha) is a class of sulphated peptides. Its precursor peptide contains 80 amino acid residues and has a hydrophobic region at its N-terminus (YangNone, 1999). In pollen, PSK-alpha regulates cell surface receptors of pollen grains to influence density-dependent pollen germination and tube growth (ChenNone, 2000). By differential screening of the maize mature pollen cDNA library, two pollen-predominant genes with putative sORFs in maize were obtained, namelyZm401(AY911609) (LiNone, 2001;DaiNone, 2004) andZm908. Alhough full-lengthZm401is 1149bp, the longest ORF is only 270bp, and encodes the 89 amino acid peptide (~10kDa) Zm401p10. Zm401plays a crucial role in the formation of Zm401p10 (WangNone, 2009). In situhybridization demonstrated thatZm401is expressed specifically in tapetal cells and microspores (MaNone, 2008). Overexpression ofZm401p10causes retardation of tapetum degeneration and reduction of pollen viability (WangNone, 2009). Here, another gene,Zm908, is studied. Functional analyses demonstrated thatZm908encodes a small functional peptide, Zm908p11 (with an estimated mol. wt of ~11kDa). This peptide is localized throughout the pollen tube. Maize with overexpressedZm908p11exhibited reduced pollen germination efficiency. This suggests that Zm908p11 functions in maize pollen germination. Protein-protein interaction assays revealed that Zm908p11 interacts with ZmPRO1. Moreover, transcript profiling data showed that overexpression ofZm908p11affects the expression of many genes involved in pollen tube growth. A possible mechanism for the involvement ofZm908p11in maize pollen germination and tube growth is discussed. Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacumcv Samsun NN andNicotiana benthamiana) seeds were surface sterilized, and then sown on Murashige and Skoog (MS) solid medium (Murashige and Skoog, 1962) containing 3% sucrose and 0.8% agar. The plates were incubated at 28 degrees C under a 16h light/8h dark photoperiod for seed germination. The seedlings were then transferred to a bottle with the same medium and cultured under the same conditions as those for seed germination. Maize inbred lines Z31 and Q31 were grown in a test field at China Agricultural University (Beijing). Immature embryos (~10 d after pollination) of the hybrid (Z31*Q31) were dissected and cultured on N6 solid medium containing 2% sucrose and 2.0mg l-12,4-D (pH 5.8) (ChuNone, 1975) for callus induction in darkness at 28 degrees C, and subcultured every 14 d until transformation. Details of the construction are given in theSupplementary Materialsandmethodsavailable atJXBonline. The sense and antisense strands of the full-lengthZm908were inserted into pBI121 between theCauliflower mosaic virus(CaMV)35Spromoter and theNosterminator to generate35S-Zm908s(Supplementary Fig. S1AatJXBonline) and35S-Zm908a(Supplementary Fig. S1B). The longest ORF,Zm908p11(+697 to +990), a site-specific mutation (the ATG start codon was replaced by AAG), and a frameshift mutation (the ATG start codon was replaced by ATGA) ofZm908p11were inserted into pBI121 between theCaMV35Spromoter and theNosterminator to generate35S-Zm908p11s(Supplementary Fig. S1CatJXBonline),35S-Zm908p11ss(Supplementary Fig. S1D), and35S-Zm908p11fs(Supplementary Fig. S1E). TheCaMV35Spromoters in35S-Zm908sand35S-Zm908p11were replaced by theLat52promoter to produceLat52-Zm908s(Supplementary Fig. S1FatJXBonline) andLat52-Zm908p11(Supplementary Fig. S1G). Zm908p11controlled by a 282bp promoter fragment ofZm908(Zm908p) and theNosterminator was fused with anhptgene (hygromycin B phosphotransferase) controlled by theCaMV35Spromoter and theNosterminator to produce the overexpression constructZm908p-Zm908p11OE(Supplementary Fig. S1HatJXBonline). The antisense strand of the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) ofZm908(Zm908p11a), a part of the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene (GUSNone), and the sense strand of the 3'-UTR ofZm908(Zm908p11s) were fused to generate the stem-loop fragment. The stem-loop fragment controlled byZm908pand theNosterminator was fused with anhptgene controlled by theCaMV35Spromoter and theNosterminator to produceZm908p-Zm908p11Ri(Supplementary Fig. S1I). The detailed construction is shown in the Supplementary Materials and methods. The35S-Zm908s,35S-Zm908a,35S-Zm908p11,35S-Zm908p11ss,35S-Zm908p11fs,Lat52-Zm908s, andLat52-Zm908p11constructs were transformed into tobacco (N. tabacumcv Samsun NN) using the leaf disc method (HorschNone, 1985). The regenerated plants were transplanted in the greenhouse at a temperature of 25 degrees C day/20 degrees C night with summer daylight and ~50% relative humidity. TheZm908p-Zm908p11OEandZm908p-Zm908p11Riconstructs were transformed into calli induced from the immature embryos of the hybrid Z31*Q31 by particle bombardment. Resistant calli were screened by 20mg ml-1hygromycin on NB medium, as described byWangNone(2006). Maize total RNA was extracted from root, stem, leaf, seed, different anther stages, and mature pollen using TRIzol(r)Reagent (Invitrogen, USA) following the manufacturer's instructions. A 2 mug aliquot of total RNA was reverse transcribed by M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega, USA) with oligo(dT)20primer. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was conducted using TaKaRa SYBR(r)Premix Ex TaqTM (TaKaRa, Japan) on a Bio-Rad Real-Time System CFX96TM C1000 thermal cycler (Bio-Rad, USA). The PCR conditions were 95 degrees C for 10 s, followed by 40 cycles of 94 degrees C for 5 s, 60 degrees C for 20 s, and 72 degrees C for 20 s. Independent biological triplicates and technical triplicates were used for each experiment. Data analysis was performed using BIO-RAD CFX Manager software (Bio-Rad, USA). The maizeTubulingene was used as an internal control. The primer pair forZm908was 9rtf and 9rtr, and forTubulinit was trtf and trtr (Supplementary Table S1atJXBonline). The relative gene expression level was calculated using the 2-DeltaDeltaCtanalysis method. Total RNAs (30 mug) extracted from root, stem, leaf, uninucleate and binucleate anthers, and mature pollen using TRIzol(r)Reagent (Invitrogen, USA) were separated on a 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gel, and transferred onto nylon membranes (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany). TheZm908p11fragment was labelled with [alpha-32P]dCTP as a probe using the Prime-a-Gene(r)Labeling System (Promega, USA). The membranes were pre-hybridized for 6h at 65 degrees C, and hybridization was performed for 20h at 65 degrees C with labelled probes. After hybridization, membranes were washed in 2* SSC/0.5% SDS for 30min and in 0.5* SSC/0.5% SDS for 30min at 65 degrees C. Finally, the hybridization signals were recorded on an X-omat BT Film (Kodak, Japan). Pollen grains were harvested from freshly opened anthers, added to 20 mul of liquid pollen germination medium, then placed onto solid pollen germination medium [10mM CaCl2, 0.05mM KH2PO4, 0.01% (w/v) H3BO3, 0.1% (w/v) yeast extract, 10% (w/v) sucrose, and 6% (w/v) PEG-4000 solidified with 1% (w/v) agar for maize pollen; 1mM CaCl2, 1mM Ca(NO3)2.4H2O, 1mM MgSO4.7H2O, 0.01% (w/v) H3BO3, and 18% (w/v) sucrose solidified with 0.5% (w/v) agar for tobacco pollen]. The plates were incubated for 3h at 28 degrees C and 100% humidity in the dark. All the calculations were performed with technical triplicates and biological triplicates. At least 400 grains were used per assay. Statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel. The antibody was produced by Beijing Protein Innovation Company, Ltd (Beijing, China;http://www.proteomics.org.cn/). A peptide corresponding to the amino acid sequence (GKWVRRGRLNPAPADC) ofZm908p11cDNA was synthesized, and 200 mug of the synthesized peptide was used to immunize rabbits subcutaneously. Booster shots were given at 12 d intervals with the same amount of antigen three times. Maize total protein from root, stem, leaf, seed, and mature pollen was extracted with an extraction buffer consisting of 2.5% (w/v) sucrose, 0.1% (v/v) beta-mercaptoethanol, and 5mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0. A 20 mug aliquot of protein was separated by 19% Tricine-SDS-PAGE (Schagger, 2006), and blotted onto a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore, USA). The western blot analysis was performed according to the method reported byGallagherNone(1993). The Zm908p11 antiserum was affinity purified and used as the primary antibody at a 1:1000 dilution. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Promega, USA) was used as the secondary antibody (1: 5000). The signal was detected using the NBT/BCIP reaction kit (Promega, USA). Mature maize pollen grains from fresh dehiscent anthers were collected and mounted on stubs using double-sided carbon tape, and coated with palladium-gold by an ion coater (Eiko IB-3, Japan). The specimens were examined on a scanning electron microscope (Hitachi S-3400N, Japan) at an accelerating voltage of 15kV. Alexander's staining assay was performed as previously described (Alexander, 1969). Mature pollen grains from fresh dehiscent anthers were collected and incubated with Alexander's solution for 10-15min, and then observed by light microscopy (Leica, Germany). For subcellular localization,Zm908p11-GFP(green fluorescent protein) was transiently transformed into tobacco pollen. For construction ofZm908p11-GFP, theZm908p11fragment was amplified by PCR using primer pair 9Gf and 9Gr (Supplementary Table S1atJXBonline), and fused to the C-terminus ofGFPin pLat52-GFP withEcoRI andKpnI sites. Fresh pollen grains were harvested from tobacco anthers and transferred into liquid pollen germination medium. Transformation was conducted by particle bombardment. Following bombardment, the pollen grains were incubated to germinate for 3h, at 28 degrees C and 100% humidity in the dark. The fluorescence of GFP was monitored using a Zeiss LSM510 (Zeiss, Germany). To determine proteins that interact with Zm908p11, the MATCHMAKER GAL4 Two-Hybrid System3 (Clontech, USA) was used. Zm908p11was amplified from pMD18-Zm908s with the primer pair y2h9Nf and y2h9Nr (Supplementary Table S1atJXBonline), and cloned in-frame into theBamHI andSalI sites of the yeast vector pGBKT7 to obtainBD-Zm908p11which was used as the bait. For screening of maize pollen protein that interacted with Zm908p11, the maize mature pollen cDNA library was ligated into pGADT7 as the prey. The constructs were co-transformed into yeast strain AH109, and screened on SD/-Ade/-His/-Leu/-Trp medium according to protocol. This was followed by X-alpha-galactosidase staining to test the interaction. For analysis of the interaction between Zm908p11 and ZmPRO1, the ORF ofZmPRO1was amplified from maize pollen cDNA with primer pair y2hPf and y2hPr (Supplementary Table S1), and cloned into theEcoRI andXhoI sites of pGADT7 to generateAD-ZmPRO1. The luciferase complementation imaging (LCI) assay was performed as previously described (ChenNone, 2008). The cDNA ofZm908p11was amplified by PCR using primers L9f and NL9r, and L9f and CL9r, andZmPRO1was amplified using LPf and NLPr, and LPf and CLPr (Supplementary Table S1atJXBonline). They were then cloned into theKpnI andSalI sites of pCAMBIA-NLuc and pCAMBIA-CLuc vectors, respectively. These constructs were transformed intoAgrobacteriumstrain GV3101. Bacterial suspensions were infiltrated into fully expanded leaves of the 7-week-oldN. benthamianaplants using a needleless syringe. Plants were grown in darkness for 12h, and then with 16h light/8h dark for 60h at 22 degrees C. Finally, the leaves were daubed with firefly luciferase and observed with an AndoriXon camera iKon-M (Andor, USA). Total RNA was extracted from mature pollen grains, collected from fresh dehiscent anthers ofZm908p-Zm908p11OEand wild-type plants, using TRIzol(r)Reagent (Invitrogen, USA). RNA quantity and quality were measured with a Nanodrop ND-2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo, USA). Microarray analyses were performed using Affymetrix microarray technology by CapitalBio Corporation (http://www.capitalbio.com) following the Affymetrix GeneChip(r)expression analysis technical manual (Affymetrix, USA). Data analysis was carried out according to the Affymetrix statistical algorithms description document (Affymetrix, USA). P-values betweenZm908p-Zm908p11OEand wild-type plants were calculated by Wilcoxon's rank test (Wilcoxon, 1945). The gene expression analysis and gene ontology were performed using AgriGo (http://bioinfo.cau.edu.cn/agriGO/). Some of the differentially expressed genes were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR using the primer pairs listed inSupplementary Table S3atJXBonline. Previously, a pollen-predominant cDNA fragment (682bp) was obtained from the maize mature pollen cDNA library by differential screening using cDNA probes synthesized from the mRNA of mature maize pollen and leaf tissue (LiNone, 2001). Using this cDNA fragment, two genomic clones were isolated by plaque hybridization experiments. One of these two clones,Zm401, has been previously described (DaiNone, 2004). The other clone, which contained a 14kb DNA fragment insertion, was digested withSalI and cloned into a pGEM-3Zf (+) vector. The ~4.5kbEcoRI/XbaI fragment was further subcloned into pGEM-3Zf (+). This clone was namedZm908following sequencing. The use of RT-PCR and 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5'-RACE) enabled a 1758bp full-length cDNA ofZm908to be cloned from mature pollen RNA. Comparison of theZm908cDNA with its genomic sequence revealed that theZm908genomic clone comprises a 5'-non-coding region (225bp), one exon (1259bp), and a 3'-non-coding region (274bp); it does not have any introns (Fig. 1A). This gene is located on chromosome 2 in the locus AC206253 (http://www.maizegdb.org). ORF prediction analysis of theZm908cDNA sequence using biological software identified many stop codons in all three possible reading frames, and no long ORFs were identified (Fig. 1B). The longest deduced ORF is 294bp in length (+697 to +990), and encodes a putative 97 amino acid peptide that is provisionally designated as Zm908p11 (Fig. 1C). The deduced Zm908p11 peptide has a molecular mass of 11kDa, with an isoelectric point (pI) of 11.6. It contains a proline-rich stretch and has no predicted signal peptide at the N-terminus (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/). A BLASTn search (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) ofZm908revealed that it was only homologous to Poaceae; no homologous genes in dicots or in other monocots were identified. The phylogenetic analysis ofZm908using MEGA4 software is shown inSupplementary Fig. S2atJXBonline. Zm908shared 65.8% identity withZm401(AY911609), 66.4% withSetaria italica Si401(DQ981487), 66.7% withOryza sativa Os401(EU426833), and 66.7% withTriticum aestivum Ta401(EU426832) cDNA, suggesting thatZm908is a Poaceae-specific gene. Gene structure and expression patterns ofZm908. (A) Gene structure ofZm908. The longest ORFZm908p11(+697 to +990) is shown by a black solid box. (B) Schematic representation of theZm908cDNA sequence. Each of the three possible reading frames ofZm908is depicted separately. Stop codons (TAG, TAA, or TGA) are indicated by filled circles. Deduced ORFs are depicted as open boxes, andZm908p11is shown by a filled box. (C) Sequence of the 97 amino acid Zm908p11 peptide; the proline-rich stretch is underlined. (D) Expression pattern ofZm908by quantitative RT-PCR analysis. They-axis shows the relative expression level, and thex-axis shows different tissues. (E) Expression pattern ofZm908by northern blot analysis. rRNAs were used as an internal control. The expression pattern of theZm908gene was initially investigated by quantitative RT-PCR. The expression ofZm908was first detected at the uninucleate stages of anthers, and increased to a peak level in mature pollen. Additionally, a weak signal forZm908was detected in leaves (Fig. 1D). To confirm the pollen-predominant expression pattern ofZm908, northern blot analysis was performed using an [alpha-32P]dCTP-labelled specific sequence of cDNA as a probe. As shown inFig. 1E, the northern blot result was consistent with that of quantitative RT-PCR. TheZm908transcript was detected from the uninucleate stage, and reached a maximum in mature pollen. No signal was detected in other tissues, with the exception of a weak band in the leaf. This indicated thatZm908may function in the late stage of pollen development and/or pollen germination and tube growth. To investigate the function ofZm908during pollen development, the full-lengthZm908cDNA was ectopically expressed in tobacco under the control of theCaMV35Spromoter, and theNosterminator (Supplementary Fig. S1AatJXBonline). As a parallel reference, antisenseZm908cDNA using the same regulatory elements (Supplementary Fig. S1B) was also transformed into tobacco. Three35S-Zm908slines and three35S-Zm908alines were selected for further investigation. Pollen grains from wild-type and transgenic lines were stained with I2-KI solution. The results were shown inFig. 2. The majority of pollen grains from the35S-Zm908santhers were malformed and the pollen I2-KI staining rate was dramatically reduced. In contrast, the pollen grains from the35S-Zm908aanthers were round and as fully stained as those of the wild type. Transgenic pollen grain phenotype and pollen I2-KI staining rate analysis. Mature pollen grains were collected from wild-type and transgenic tobacco plants. (A) Tobacco pollen grains were stained with I2-KI solution. Normal pollen grains are deeply stained with a round shape, whereas malformed pollen grains are not stainable. Bars=200 mum. (B) The mature pollen I2-KI staining rate (%) in transgenic tobacco. 35S-Zm908s-1/2/3and35S-Zm908a-1/2/3are transgenic tobacco lines. All the calculations were performed with technical triplicates and biological triplicates, and at least 400 grains were used per assay. Error bars represent the mean +/-SD; **P less than 0.01 (Student'st-test). Considering that theZm908sequence has no long ORF, the longest ORF is 294bp and encodes a putative 97 amino acid peptide Zm908p11. Does theZm908function as Zm908p11? To answer this question, western blot analysis was performed using Zm908p11 antiserum to test for the existence of the Zm908p11 peptide in wild-type maize. Excitingly, a band at the expected size of 11kDa was detected in mature maize pollen, but not in other tissues (Fig. 3). This indicated that the small peptide Zm908p11 is present in mature pollen. Western blot analysis of Zm908p11 peptide in maize. Immunoblot of 20 mug of total protein extracted from root, stem, leaf, seed, and mature pollen loaded as indicated. To confirm whether the transgenic phenotypes observed in35S-Zm908santhers were caused byZm908p11, the construct35S-Zm908p11(Supplementary Fig. S1CatJXBonline) was transformed into tobacco to produce ectopic overexpression ofZm908p11lines. The transgenic lines did not show any noticeable differences in vegetative and floral development. However, I2-KI pollen grain staining revealed that only 38.2% of35S-Zm908p11pollen grains were normal in comparison with full-lengthZm908transgenic tobacco (Fig. 4A,B). Transgenic pollen grain phenotype and analysis. Mature pollen grains were collected from wild-type and transgenic tobacco plants. (A) and (C) Tobacco pollen grains were stained with I2-KI solution.

(B) The mature pollen I2-KI staining rate (%) in transgenic tobacco. (D)In vitropollen tube germination assay. Pollen grains were incubatedin vitrofor 3h at 28 degrees C and 100% humidity in the dark. Bars=250 mum. (E)In vitropollen germination efficiency analysis in transgenic tobacco. Lat52-Zm908s-1/2/3andLat52-Zm908p11-1/2/3are transgenic tobacco lines. All the calculations were performed with technical triplicates and biological triplicates, and at least 400 grains were used per assay. Error bars represent the mean +/-SD; **P less than 0.01 (Student'st-test). To elucidate further the requirement for an intact ORF ofZm908p11, a site-specific mutation (Zm908p11ss;Supplementary Fig. S1DatJXBonline) and a frameshift mutation (Zm908p11fs;Supplementary Fig. S1E) were generated and ectopically expressed in tobacco. I2-KI staining showed that both35S-Zm908p11ssand35S-Zm908p11fstransgenic pollen grains were round and dark-stained like those of the wild type (Fig. 4A,B). This indicated that both the site-specific and the frameshift mutation, which abolished production of Zm908p11 peptide, failed to show any of the phenotypic changes found in35S-Zm908p11transgenic lines. These results demonstrated thatZm908functions as Zm908p11. To check whether the transgenic phenotypes that were found were a consequence of constitutive expression ofZm908p11controlled by theCaMV35Spromoter, two constructsLat52-Zm908s(Supplementary Fig. S1FatJXBonline) andLat52-Zm908p11(Supplementary Fig. S1G), controlled by the pollen-specific promoterLat52, were introduced into tobacco. Unlike the transgenic lines with constitutive expression ofZm908andZm908p11, bothLat52-Zm908sandLat52-Zm908p11pollen showed normal I2-KI staining (Fig. 4C), and decreased germination efficiency (15.6-18.3% forLat52-Zm908and 16.5-20.1% forLat52-Zm908p11) compared with wild-type pollen (93.6-98.1%,Fig. 4D,E) in anin vitrogermination test. These results implied that Zm908p11 is functional in maize pollen germination. To investigate whether Zm908p11 peptide is localized in the pollen tube,Lat52-Zm908p11GFPwas constructed and introduced into fresh tobacco pollen grains by particle bombardment transformation. Lat52-GFPwas used as a control. The green fluorescence signal of Zm908p11-GFP was observed throughout the pollen tube cytoplasm at the same levels as free GFP (Fig. 5); this indicated that Zm908p11 peptide was distributed in the pollen tube. Subcellular localization of Zm908p11 peptide in tobacco pollen tubein vitro. Bars=10 mum. To analyse the function ofZm908p11in maize, 282bp of theZm908promoter region (Zm908p) was obtained from theZm908genomic clone. The construct ofZm908pfused withGUSwas transformed into tobacco. Five independently transgenic lines were selected to characterize promoter activity. The results showed that GUS expression was mainly detected in the mature pollen grains of the transgenic anthers (Supplementary Fig. S3atJXBonline). In contrast, the anthers from untransformed control plants did not show any detectable GUS activity (data not shown). UsingZm908p, the plant expression constructsZm908p-Zm908p11OE(Supplementary Fig. S1HatJXBonline) andZm908p-Zm908p11Ri(Supplementary Fig. S1I) were designed and transformed into maize calli by particle bombardment to generateZm908p11-overexpressing and RNAi (RNA interference) transgenic plants, respectively. Quantitative RT-PCR was conducted to analyse the relative expression level ofZm908p11in pollen grains (Fig. 6A). Two overexpressing lines and two RNAi lines were selected for further investigation. The vegetative and reproductive development of both transgenic lines was normal. Additionally, the pollen grains were observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Alexander, I2-KI, and 4',6-diamiaino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining. The results are shown inSupplementary Fig. S4atJXBonline. No differences were observed between the mature pollen grains from transgenic lines and those of the wild type, indicating thatZm908p11may not function in pollen grain development. Phenotypic analysis of pollen fromZm908-Zm908p11OE, Zm908p-Zm908p11Ri, and wild-type maize plants. (A) Relative expression level ofZm908p11in transgenic and wild-type maize pollen.

Pollen grains were culturedin vitrofor 3h at 28 degrees C and 100% humidity in the dark. Bars=100 mum. Error bars represent the mean +/-SD; **P less than 0.01 (Student'st-test). In vitropollen germination assays were further carried out. Only 33.1-37.7% of pollen grains fromZm908p11-overexpressing anthers yielded normal pollen tubes under these conditions (Fig. 6B,C), whereas 78.3% of pollen grains from the wild type (Fig. 6B,D) and 77.2-81.2% fromZm908p11RNAi anthers (Fig. 6B,E) could produce normal pollen tubes. These findings indicated thatZm908p11may function in maize pollen germination and tube growth. Protein-protein interaction assays were performed to investigate the function of Zm908p11 further. Zm908p11 was designed as a bait to screen a prey cDNA library prepared from mature maize pollen using yeast two-hybrid assay. A maize profilin 1 (ZmPRO1, P35081.1) was identified. A yeast transformant carrying a pair of constructs (BD-Zm908p11/AD-ZmPRO1) could grow on the SD/-Trp/-Leu/-His/-Ade selection medium, indicating direct interaction of Zm908p11 and ZmPRO1. The X-alpha-galactosidase assay was employed to verify the results (Fig. 7A). Interaction of Zm908p11 with ZmPRO1. (A) Yeast two-hybrid assay. The yeast strains AH109 harbouring the construct pairsBD-Zm908p11/AD,BD-Zm908p11/AD-ZmPRO1, andBD/AD-ZmPRO1grow on SD/-His/-Trp and SD/-Ade/-His/-Leu/-Trp agar medium, respectively, and X-alpha-galactosidase assays were performed to verify protein-protein interactions. (B) LCI assay. The 7-week-old tobacco leaf was transformed by infiltration with the bacterial suspensions containing construct pairs using a needleless syringe. The left panel shows the bright field image and the right panel shows the fluorescence field image of the treated leaf. In addition to the yeast two-hybrid assay, the interaction between Zm908p11 and ZmPRO1 has also been verified by a firefly LCI assay (ChenNone, 2008). To conduct this assay, the following pairs of constructs,NLuc-Zm908p11/CLuc-ZmPRO1,CLuc-Zm908p11/NLuc-ZmPRO1,NLuc/CLuc,NLuc-ZmPRO1/CLuc,NLuc/CLuc-ZmPRO1,NLuc-Zm908p11/CLuc, andNLuc/CLuc-Zm908p11, were designed. Each pair of constructs was transformed intoAgrobacteriumstrain GV3101, followed by infiltration of tobacco (N. benthamiana) leaves. The pairsNLuc-Zm908p11/CLuc-ZmPRO1andCLuc-Zm908p11/NLuc-ZmPRO1generated fluorescence signals in the transformed tobacco leaf (Fig. 7B). In contrast, no fluorescent signals were detected using the negative control sets. Affymetrix microarray analysis was employed to explore the gene expression ofZm908p11transgenic maize. Total RNA extracted from mature pollen grains collected from fresh dehiscent anthers ofZm908p-Zm908p11OEand wild-type plants was used. Compared with wild-type pollen, 476 genes showed differential expression inZm908p11transgenic pollen. Among these, 273 genes were up-regulated and 203 down-regulated (fold change greater than =2). Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed that these differentially expressed genes were involved in cellular and metabolic processes, developmental processes, and localization (Supplementary Table S2atJXBonline). Among the up-regulated genes, 23 genes (4.8%) belonged to the categories of developmental processes and cellular component biogenesis, whereas 14.8% of down-regulated genes belonged to localization and establishment of localization processes. To validate the microarray data, three up-regulated genes (AI714808,protein phosphatase methylesterase 1, +2.076; CD438012,heat shock protein18c, +2.285; and AY172634,isoamylase-type starch debranching enzyme ISO3, +2.001) and two down-regulated genes (AF302187,sucrose export defective1, -2.583; and CF021148,CaM, -4.78), which are involved in pollen germination and tube growth, were selected for quantitative RT-PCR analysis. The quantitative RT-PCR results confirmed the microarray data (Fig. 8). Quantitative RT-PCR of five genes identified from microarray analysis.

Transcripts encoding sORFs are under-represented in transcriptome profiling. In maize, 8% of full-length cDNAs characterized encode ORFs of 100 amino acids and 4% encode ORFs of 40 amino acids (SoderlundNone, 2009). KastenmayerNone(2006) provided the first evidence that small peptides encoded by sORF genes could be translated and are functional inSaccharomyces cerevisiae. These findings spur on the further investigation of small peptide genes. In this study, the focus is on a new maize small peptide, Zm908p11, encoded by an sORF gene involved in pollen germination and tube growth. Furthermore the molecular mechanisms for its function are proposed. Previously two sORF genes,Zm401andZm908, were obtained. WangNone(2009) demonstrated thatZm401actually functions as a small peptide, Zm401p10, rather than as a non-coding RNA as previously believed (DaiNone, 2004,2007). TheZm401p10transcript was first detected in microspores and tapetal cells at the tetrad stage of anthers, and continued to accumulate thereafter, reaching its maximum level in mature pollen. The expression ofZm908p11was initially weak at post-meiotic uninucleate stages, gradually increased thereafter, and reached its maximum level in mature pollen (Fig. 1D,E). Therefore, the expression patterns of these two genes are very similar in that there is low expression in early stages, building to a maximum in pollen. Overexpression ofZm401p10in transgenic maize under the control of the nativeZm401promoter delayed tapetal layer degradation, and most microspores were sterile. In contrast, pollen maturation appeared to be normal in maize plants that overexpressedZm908p11, but the germination efficiency of pollen grains was significantly reduced (Fig. 6B). The function ofZm908as an sORF product of Zm908p11 is based on the following evidence. First, overexpression of the full-lengthZm908gene, controlled byCaMV35SorLat52promoters, in tobacco caused abnormality in pollen development or tube growth. The same phenotypes were observed when the same methods were used to overexpressZm908p11in tobacco (Figs 2,4). Secondly, a protein with the expected size of Zm908p11 was detected in mature pollen by western blot analysis (Fig. 3). Finally, the pollen development of transgenic tobacco carrying constructs containing a site-specific or frameshift mutation ofZm908p11was the same as seen in the wild type (Fig. 4A,B). These results indicated thatZm908functions as Zm908p11. Transgenic tobacco withZm908orZm908p11controlled by the promotersCaMV35SandLat52, respectively, revealed different phenotypes. Pollen development was defective under the control of theCaMV35Spromoter, whereas pollen germination efficiency was decreased and pollen development was normal under the control of theLat52promoter. The distinct phenotypes may be due to the specificity of these two promoters. The genesZm908andZm908p11controlled by theCaMV35Spromoter were constitutively expressed in all tissues of transgenic tobacco, whereas genes controlled byLat52were exclusively expressed in pollen. Actin dynamics are essential for pollen tube growth, and are maintained by the interaction of actin with a multitude of ABPs. Profilins can bind to actin monomers, and also bind to ligands containing a proline-rich stretch, such as formin (MahoneyNone, 1999). Profilin-actin complexes are able to prevent new actin filament nucleation, which is the rate-limiting step for actin polymerization (Pollard and Cooper, 1984). While barbed ends of actin filaments are present, formins promote profilin-actin nucleation due to binding to profilin, and then new monomers continuously add to the elongating filament (RomeroNone, 2004). In the present study, a proline-rich stretch was identified in Zm908p11 (Fig. 1C). The detected interaction between Zm908p11 and profilin may be a result of this structural feature. According to these results and a model for regulation of actin turnover reviewed byStaigerNone(2010), the following scenario for Zm908p11 in the regulation of pollen tube growth is proposed (Fig. 9). In wild-type pollen grains, it is suggested that a normal level of Zm908p11-profilin-actin is in dynamic equilibrium with profilin-actin. Zm908p11-profilin-actin is more stable and prevents actin nucleation. Once the pollen tube grows, actin nucleation occurs following the release of profilin from profilin-actin, which is triggered by the interaction between formin-like ligand and profilin, and then actin monomer adds to the barbed end of the actin filament to elongate, while Zm908p11-profilin-actin does not participate in nucleation and elongation (Fig. 9, process A). A simple mechanism for Zm908p11 in regulating actin dynamics. In wild-type pollen grains, Zm908p11-profilin-actin is in dynamic equilibrium with profilin-actin. Actin nucleation occurs following the release of profilin from profilin-actin, which is triggered by the interaction between formin-like ligand and profilin, and then actin monomer adds to the barbed end of the actin filament to elongate, while Zm908p11-profilin-actin does not participate in nucleation and elongation (process A). InZm908p11-overexpressing maize pollen, the increase in Zm908p11-profilin-actin may dramatically suppress the nucleation of actin filaments, or the remaining level of profilin-actin is not sufficient to maintain the elongation of actin filaments (process B). In contrast, inZm908p11RNAi maize pollen, the decreased level of Zm908p11 leads to an increase in profilin-actin. Profilin-actin assembles on the barbed end of the actin filament in the presence of formin-like ligand. Thus, the actin filament nucleated and elongated, as in the wild type (process C). InZm908p11-overexpressing maize, the increased level of Zm908p11 disturbs the dynamic equilibrium between profilin-actin and Zm908p11-profilin-actin. The increase in Zm908p11-profilin-actin may dramatically suppress the nucleation of actin filaments, or the remaining level of profilin-actin may not be sufficient to maintain the elongation of actin filaments. Therefore, the deficiency of pollen germination and pollen tube growth was observed in overexpressing maize (Fig. 9, process B). In contrast, inZm908p11RNAi maize, the decreased level of Zm908p11 leads to an increase of profilin-actin. Profilin-actin assembles on the barbed end of the actin filament in the presence of formin-like ligand. Thus, the actin filament was nucleated and elongated, as in the wild type, resulting in the normal growth of pollen tubes (Fig. 9, process C). It is possible thatZm908may also act as a signalling factor to regulate gene expression in plants. Therefore, microarray technology was used to analyse the gene expression patterns ofZm908p11-overexpressing maize. This identified 203 genes as being down-regulated, including several genes that are involved in pollen tube growth. An example of a significantly down-regulated gene isCaM(CF021148, fold change: -4.78); this shares 97-99% identity withArabidopsis CaMgenes. CaM is a small conserved Ca2+-binding protein and has no enzymatic activity. After binding to Ca2+, the complex can modulate many downstream cellular target proteins, and this leads to a series of different physiological responses (Snedden and Fromm, 1998,2001). In theArabidopsis cam2-2mutant, pollen germination efficiency was reduced nearly 30% compared with the wild typein vitro(LandoniNone, 2010). In conclusion, a novel maize small peptide Zm908p11 was identified which plays a required role during pollen tube growth. Zm908p11 may be a ligand of profilins to prevent profilin-actin nucleation. Additionally, it may participate in a molecular network in association with pollen tube development. Supplementary data are available atJXBonline. Figure S1.
