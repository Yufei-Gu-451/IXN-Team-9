In previous work,None,Nonewe showed that the motion of particles in polymer liquids (solutions and melts) is different on short and long time scales because it is determined by the dynamics of surrounding polymers. At relatively short time scales the motion of particles is subdiffusive as it is coupled to the segmental dynamics of polymers, whereas at relatively long times the particle motion is diffusive. The terminal diffusion coefficient of particles does not depend on the polymer molecular weight if the particle size is smaller than the entanglement length of the polymer liquids. The diffusion coefficient of particles larger than the entanglement length decreases with 3.4 power of the molecular weight of linear polymers, because particles probe the terminal dynamics of entangled polymers. These predictions have been verified by a recent systematic experimental study. NoneThe diffusion coefficient of these large particles decreases with increasing matrix viscosity; however, the large particles can still move as the polymer liquids relax, no matter how slow the relaxation is. The question then is as follows: What is the particle mobility in polymers that cannot relax, for example, in permanently cross-linked networks? Can particles move through permanently cross-linked networks if their size is larger than the network mesh size? A prior workNoneaddressed this question via a mode-coupling approach and obtained the fact that the hopping distance of large particles in polymer melts increases with particle size, while the hopping energy barrier asymptotically varies proportionally to the particle volume, which is qualitatively different from the results of our paper. On the basis of our prior work,None,Nonewe present a systematic scaling description for diffusion of such large particles in both unentangled and entangled polymer solids (networks and gels) and entangled liquids (melts and solutions). We argue that in permanently cross-linked networks the only way for a particle with size exceeding the network mesh size to leave a confinement cage is by hopping-waiting for the fluctuation of a gate (loop) between two neighboring confinement cages to become large enough to slip around the particle. To describe the particle hopping diffusion, we introduce two important parameters, hopping free energy barrier and hopping step size. The free energy barrier is determined by the deformation of a loop (gate) as it slips around the particle. To describe particle confinement in unentangled networks with strongly overlapping chains and to estimate the hopping step size, we introduce a model of "overlapping elementary networks". The idea of hopping diffusion of particles in unentangled permanent networks is extended to describe diffusion of particles in entangled polymer networks, which contain both permanent cross-links and topologically trapped entanglements. Unlike the fixed permanent cross-links, entanglements can slide along polymer chains. Therefore, the confinement cages due to entanglements are "softer" in comparison to the network cages formed by permanent cross-links. Consequently, there is a range of particle sizes for which the particle diffusion is dominated by hopping of particles between entanglement cages. Unlike entangled polymer networks, there are no permanent cross-links in entangled polymer liquids; polymers in entangled liquids can relax on long time scales. We show that there is a certain (polymer molecular weight dependent) particle size above which the hopping diffusion of particles between entanglement cages becomes very difficult; it is relatively easier for the very large particle to diffuse at long time scales by "waiting" for the entangled polymer liquid to relax and flow around the particle. The paper is structured as follows. In section2, we discuss hopping diffusion of large particles in unentangled polymer solids (networks and gels). To estimate the step size and entropic free energy barrier for hopping, we model the "real" unentangled network by many overlapping "elementary" networks. Hopping diffusion of particles in entangled polymer solids is discussed in section3. Section4presents the diffusion of probe particles in entangled polymer liquids. Specifically, we compare the particle motion due to the relaxation of polymer chains and that due to hopping and calculate the range of parameters for which each of two diffusion modes dominates. Concluding remarks are presented in section5. A typical polymer network has both chemical cross-links and topological entanglements. The properties of the polymer network are dominated by the type of constraints that has higher density. Therefore, we distinguish two types of networks: unentangled and entangled polymer networks, depending on the relative values of network mesh size and entanglement length scale. The network mesh size is defined as the average distance between two neighboring permanent cross-links along the chain and can be measured by the value of unentangled network elastic modulus. The entanglement length is measured by the magnitude of entanglement plateau modulus. None-NoneThe case of high density of permanent cross-links, with the network mesh size smaller than the entanglement length, is classified as unentangled polymer network. In the opposite case of entangled polymer network the network mesh size is larger than the entanglement length and the network properties are dominated by the topological entanglements between network strands. Consider the motion of a probe particle of sizedin a dry, monodisperse unentangled permanently cross-linked network above its glass transition temperatureTgand crystallization transition temperatureTNone. Let us denote the number of Kuhn monomers between two neighboring cross-links byNNoneand the size of a network strand byaNone? bNNone1/2, wherebis Kuhn length. In a typical network there are many network strands overlapping within the volume pervaded by a network strand (see Figure1). The overlap parameterP? NNone1/2is defined as the number of network strands within the volumeaNone3? (bNNone1/2)3pervaded by one network strand. Unentangled polymer network modeled by overlapping "elementary" networks. (a) Schematic visualization of a particle of sizedin an unentangled polymer network with strands of average sizeaNone. The solid circles represent permanent cross-links. There areP? NNone1/2network strands within the pervaded volumeaNone3of a network strand. (b) The unentangled polymer network is modeled byPoverlapping yet independent "elementary" polymer networks, with details discussed inAppendix A. One of these "elementary" networks is shown by bright black lines while the remainingP- 1 "elementary" networks are shown by dimmed color lines. A large probe particle of sized(d greater than aNone) is confined inside the unentangled network, as shown in Figure1a. However, it is still possible for this particle to escape from the cage formed by network strands confining the particle. This escape-a hopping step-occurs by a large fluctuation of the one of these strands. To understand this process, we model the monodisperse unentangled network byPoverlapping yet independent "elementary" networks, as shown in Figure1b. The details of this representation are discussed inAppendix A. There is on the order of one network strand per volumeaNone3in each of these "elementary" networks. The "elementary" networks are not static; instead, they are fluctuating all the time. The fluctuation of an "elementary" network cage can be large enough to allow one of the network strands to slip around the particle. In this case a hopping event occurs and the particle enters a neighboring cage of the network. We use the model of "elementary" networks to elucidate the hopping diffusion of large particles. Step size of a large probe particle hopping between two neighboring cages in a monodisperse unentangled polymer network. (a) The unentangled polymer network is modeled byPoverlapping "elementary" networks with their network cage centersr1, ...,rNone, ...,rNone(dots) randomly distributed around the fluctuation center of the particle (its equilibrium position). The constraint applied to a large particle of sized greater than aNonefrom an "elementary" network is modeled by a virtual chain withncagemonomers. The virtual chain has one of its two ends attached to the particle center, and the other anchored to the center of a cage ofith "elementary" network, as shown by the black dots. (b) During a single hopping event the particle leaves its initial equilibrium positionOand arrives at a neighboring equilibrium positionO' with a step size Deltar. This hop is achieved by the particle leaving the confinement cage of the "elementary" networkiwith the centerrNonethat is most likely to be the furthest from the initial equilibrium positionOof the particle and entering the neighboring cage of the same "elementary" network with the center atrNone+aNone, while staying in the same cages of all the rest "elementary" networks. Each ofP"elementary" networks constrains the particle independently and tends to localize the particle at the "center" of its own cage. We model the constraint from an "elementary" network by a virtual chain with one of its two ends attached to the particle center and the other anchored at the center of the "elementary" network cage, as illustrated by the dashed lines and black dots in Figure2a. The number of monomers,ncage, per virtual chain is determined by equating its elastic energy and the elastic deformation energy of an "elementary" network when the particle is shifted from its equilibrium position by a distancedeltar(seeAppendix C):NoneNonewhich givesNoneNoneInstead of fluctuating around the cage "center" in a particular "elementary" network, the particle finds an "optimal" position at which the restoring forces from all the "elementary" networks are balanced. The centers of cages inP"elementary" networks are randomly distributed within the volume on the order ofaNone3around the equilibrium position of the probe particle, as illustrated in Figure2b. At this equilibrium position the net force exerted by theseP"elementary" networks on the particle is zero. The restoring forcefNoneapplied to the particle from thejth "elementary" network is linearly proportional to the deviation deltarNoneof the particle from the "center" of the "elementary" network cage,fNone= [kNoneT/(b2ncage)] deltarNone, as the confinement potential is parabolic (see eq1andAppendix C). Assuming that all virtual chains have the same number of monomersncage, we haveNoneNoneThe hopping step size for a large probe particle (d greater than aNone) moving through the unentangled network is much smaller than that for an "elementary" network because the particle is constrained by many surrounding overlapping "elementary" networks. During a single hopping step the particle moves by a displacement Deltarand arrives at a new equilibrium position. The particle most likely escapes from the cage of an "elementary" networki, whose center is at the maximum distance from the equilibrium position of the particle, as the corresponding free energy barrier is the lowest compared with that of other "elementary" networks. NoneConsequently, after leaving the cage centerrNoneof the "elementary" networki, the particle enters the neighboring cage, whose centerrNone+aNoneis separated by a vectoraNonefrom the old cage, and deviates by a vector deltarNone'= deltarNone+ Deltar-aNonefrom the new equilibrium position. Note that deviations from the cage centers of all otherP- 1 "elementary" networks to the new equilibrium position of the particle are changed by a vector Deltar(see Figure2). Since at this new equilibrium position the net force exerted on the particle byP"elementary" networks is still zero, one obtains the equation for the step size Deltarof particle hopNoneNoneEquation4can be rewritten using eq3asPDeltar-aNone= 0, which gives the magnitude of the step size of particle hop in a dry networkNoneNoneIt is important to emphasize that this displacement DeltarisP? NNone1/2times smaller than the hopping step sizeaNone? bNNone1/2in a single "elementary" network. To hop from one cage to a neighboring one, the large probe particle has to overcome a free energy barrier, which is defined as the difference between the maximum and the initial elastic deformation energy of the network strands during the hopping event. To estimate the energy barrier, one might think that it is necessary to consider the deformation energy of allP(d3/aNone3) network strands affected by the large probe particle,Nonewhich is the number of network strandsd3/(b3NNone) within its pervaded volumed3. However, not all of the affected network strands are deformed in the same way during a single hopping event. Indeed, it is enough for one network loop to slip around the particle for this particle to hop between neighboring cages. Stretching the slipping loop also results in further deformation of loops connected to it. However, deformation of all other affected loops can be taken into account using the concept of "virtual chains", which, effectively, only renormalizes the length of the slipping loop. The size of a loop in "elementary" networks is aboutaNone(seeAppendix A). Illustration of a large probe particle hop from one network cage to a neighboring cage with only one network loop (highlighted by red) slipping around the particle. The energy barrier due to the slipping loop corresponds to the "transition" state in which the large particle is leaving the initial cage and is at the onset of entering the neighboring cage (see "transition" state in Figure3). In this state the network loop is stretched from lengthaNoneto the order of particle sized(in fact, the peripheral lengthpidof the particle). Therefore, the entropic free energy barrier contributed from the deformation of the loop slipping around the particle (barrier loop) during a single hopping event isNoneNoneA loop of size larger thandcan slip around the particle, resulting in a hopping step. The hopping free energy barrier (eq6) determines the probability of a loop fluctuating to a size larger than the particle sized. This probability is proportional to? None? dxexp (-x2/aNone2)/aNone. The waiting time for this hopping step in a dry unentangled polymer network isNoneNonewhereNoneNoneis the Rouse relaxation time of a network strand, at which a loop attempts to slip around the particle but is unlikely to succeed utill tauNonenet. The monomer relaxation time tau0in eq8isNoneNonewith zeta corresponding to the monomeric friction coefficient. The mean-square displacement for a large particle hopping in a dry unentangled polymer network is proportional to the number of stepst/tauNonenetthat the particle makes during a certain period of timeNoneNoneThe hopping process occurs on time scales longer than the relaxation time of a network strand tauNone, but with a very small probability to succeed during this relatively short time interval. The probability of a hop increases with time interval and becomes significant enough for a successful hopping to occur at the waiting time scale tauNonenet(eq7). In addition to hopping the particle is fluctuating within the network cells without leaving them at times longer than relaxation time of a network strand tauNone. We model the total restoring force on the particle due toP"elementary" networks by elastic force from a composite virtual chain, which consists ofPvirtual chains withncagemonomers connected in parallel, as shown in Figure2. The number of monomersncage/Pof such a composite virtual chain determines the mean-square fluctuations of the particle on time scales longer than network strand relaxation time:NoneNoneOne can use microrheological approach to estimate the network modulus from the amplitude of these thermal fluctuations of the particle:GNone? kNoneT/(d? r2? fluctnet) ? kNoneTP/aNone3(see eqC.3). We would like to stress that the particle motion at timest greater than tauNoneis due to the superposition of the two processes: fluctuations around the center of a network cage but without leaving it (eq11) and hopping between neighboring network cages (eq10). The contribution to the particle mean-square displacement from hopping ? r2(t)? hopnetbecomes important at certain time scale tauhopnet, at which ? r2(t)? hopnetis comparable to the mean-square displacement ? r2? fluctnetdue to particle fluctuations within the confinement cage. This gives the crossover time at which hopping diffusion becomes observableNoneNoneThe mean-square displacement of the particle does not significantly increase until time scale tauhopnet, as shown in Figure4. At time scales longer than tauhopnetthe mean-square displacement of large particles is dominated by the hopping diffusion (see eq10):NoneNoneThe particle diffusion coefficient due to hopping in a dry unentangled network (see eq10) isNoneNoneFor a relatively large particle, the hopping diffusion is extremely slow as the mean-square displacement of particles decreases exponentially with the square of particle size. At times shorter than the relaxation time tauNone(eq8), the motion of a large probe particle (d greater than aNone) is unaffected by network cages and is similar to particle movement in polymer melts. The particle motion on timest less than tauNoneis subdiffusive with the mean-square displacement proportional to the square root of time, since particle motion is coupled to the segmental dynamics of network strands, as shown by the solid line with the slope 1/2 in Figure4. NoneNoneNoneThe effective viscosity etaeff(t) "felt" by the particle during time intervaltcorresponds to a melt with chains containing (t/tau0)1/2monomers coherently moving at this time. NoneAt times shorter than the crossover time taubal, the particle moves along ballistic trajectories. The mean-square velocity of the particlevis determined by the equipartition theoremNoneNoneSubstitutingr=upsilontin eq16we find the particle mean-square displacement for ballistic motion (see Figure4):NoneNoneMatching eqs15and17att= taubalgives the crossover time between the ballistic and subdiffusive regimes:NoneNoneThe width of the ballistic regime is determined by the time scale taubal. For large particles with higher density rhoNonein liquids of low viscosity, it is possible that taubal greater than tau0, ormb/(zetatau0d) greater than 1. This dimensionless ratio can be written asmb/(zetatau0d) ? (d/b)2(etaref/etaNone)2, where the reference viscosity etaref= (rhoNonekNoneT/b)1/2is determined by the particle density rhoNoneand Kuhn lengthbwith a typical value etaref? 10-4Pa.s. Thus, for the ratio of the particle to Kuhn monomer size larger than the ratio of viscositiesd/b greater than etaNone/etarefthe ballistic regime ends at time scales longer than tau0and "eats" part of the subidiffusion regime. Indeed, the ballistic regime is experimentally observable by using particle tracking of ultrahigh temporal-spatial resolutions. NoneThe ballistic regime puts the short-time cutoff at taubalto the application of microrheology, since the particle motion at time scalest less than taubalis not coupled to the modes of the probed matrix. The long-time cutoff to the application of microrheology is determined by the hopping process, as the finite zero-shear-rate viscosity predicted by the generalized Stokes-Einstein approach from particle diffusion at time scalest greater than tauhopnetdoes not correspond to the infinite zero-shear-rate viscosity of a permanent network. Time dependence of the product of mean-square displacement ?Deltar2(t)? and the particle sizedfor large particles subjected to the confinement from cages of sizea. The motion of large particles (d greater than a) is not affected by confinement cells at time scales shorter than the relaxation time tauNone(see eq23) of a strand. The particle motion is ballistic at very short time scales (t less than taubal; eq18) and crosses over into subdiffusive at longer time scales (taubal less than t less than tauNone). At time scales longer than tauNonethe particles are trapped by confinement cells; they cannot move until time scale tauNone, at which the particles start to hop between neighboring confinement cells. The hopping diffusion becomes experimentally observable on time scale tauhop, at which mean-square displacement of the particle due to hopping becomes comparable to that due to fluctuations of the particle within a confinement cell,a2b/d(eq11). For dry unentangled polymer networksaaNone, tauNone tauNone(eq8), tauNone tauNonenet(eq7), and tauhop tauhopnet(eq12); for entangled polymer networks and melts,aaNone, tauNone tauNone(eq23), tauNone tauNoneent(eq22), and tauhop tauhopent(eq26). Logarithmic scales. An unentangled polymer gel can be treated as an "effective" unentangled dry polymer network in which the "effective" monomers are correlation blobs. Therefore, the results of particle hopping in dry polymer networks can be directly applied to polymer gels with hopping step sizebreplaced by the correlation length xi (see eqD.2) and other parameters replaced by concentration dependent ones (see eqsD.3andD.4inAppendix D). The key elements for hopping diffusion of large particles in unentangled polymer gels are summarized in Table1and their detailed discussion is presented inAppendix D. Deltaris the hopping step size, DeltaUis the entropic free energy barrier, andDhopis the hopping diffusion coefficient. Length scales:bis the size of a Kuhn monomer, xi is correlation length,aNoneis the network strand size, anddis the particle size. Time scales: tau0is the monomeric relaxation time, tauxiis relaxation time of correlation volume, tauNoneand tauNonecorrespond to the relaxation time of a network and entanglement strand respectively. Note that we consider above only monodisperse polymer networks. However, real polymer networks are polydisperse as they are typically made of strands of different molecular weight. The motion of a large particle in real polymer networks could be affected by the polydispersity. Interestingly, we find that there is still a window in which the particle motion is not affected by the network polydispersity even for particles larger than the average network loop size (seeAppendix B). Within this window, the variation of energy barriers due to polydispersity is smaller than the thermal energykNoneT. As a result, polydispersity of the network becomes important only for very large particles with size larger than average loop sized greater than aNonel? 1/2, in whichl? ? lnPis the average number of network strands in a loop (seeAppendix A). These particles diffuse extremely slow with exponentially small diffusion coefficient. This interesting behavior will be the subject of future explorations. Fluctuations of chains in polymer solids (networks and gels) are suppressed by both permanent cross-links and entanglements. In entangled polymer solids the density of permanent cross-links is lower than the density of entanglements so that the tube diameteraNoneis smaller than the network mesh sizeaNone. The hopping diffusion of large particles with sizeaNone less than d less than aNone2/aNonein entangled polymer solids can be readily obtained by extending the results of hopping diffusion of large particles in unentangled polymer solids withaNone less than aNone(see section2). However, unlike the loop formed in permanently cross-linked networks, the loop formed by entanglements does not have fixed number of monomers. Indeed, the number of monomers contained in a particular loop increases when the loop slides over the particle because some chain segments far from the particle are pulled in as the particle slips through the loop. The number of monomersnin the loop is determined by the condition that the tension in the loop is balanced by the tube tensionkT/aNone:NoneNonein which the termkNoneTd/(nb2) corresponds to the tension in the loop ofnmonomers, and the tube diameter (entanglement length)aNone? bNNone1/2withNNonebeing the number of monomers per entanglement strand. Therefore, the number of monomers in the loop that slides over the particle isNoneNoneand the free energy barrier for particle hopping between entanglement cages isNoneNoneThis free energy barrier for the probe particle to hop between entanglement cages (eq21) has a weaker (linear) dependence on particle sized/aNonein comparison to the quadratic dependence for cross-linked networks (see eq6). This linear free energy barrier (eq21) represents the softening of the confining potential due to the increase in the distance between entanglements under network stretching. NoneNotice that the polydispersity of chain lengths does not affect the barrier energy (eq21) in the case of lightly cross-linked networks (NNone greater than NNone). Our prediction for the particle size dependence of free energy barrier in entangled polymer melts (eq21) is different from prediction of ref (43). The waiting time for the particle to hop between two neighboring entanglement cages is (see eq7)NoneNonein which the relaxation time of an entanglement strand isNoneNoneThis waiting time (eq22) increases exponentially with the relative size of the particledwith respect to the size of an entanglement strandaNone, but with a relatively weaker dependence on particle sizedthan that for unentangled polymer solids (see eq7). This weaker dependence is due to the lower energy of nonaffine deformation of entanglement strands (see eq21) in comparison with stronger affine deformation of unentangled polymer networks and gels (see eq6). For instance, for particles with sizedtwice larger than the entanglement meshaNoneor network mesh sizeaNone(d/aNone=d/aNone= 2) the ratio of two waiting times is tauNoneent/tauNonegel? exp ((d/aNone) - (d/aNone)2) ? exp (2-22) ? 10-1. Since the particle "feels" network modulusGNone? kNoneT/(aNone2b), the mean-square fluctuations of the particle trapped by the entanglement net is:NoneNoneThe ballistic and subdiffusive motion at shorter time scales are similar to the case of unentangled networks (eqs15and17) with the crossover time at the upper boundary of subdiffusive regime equal to the relaxation time of entanglement strand tauNone, see Figure4.

This is because the entropic free energy barrier due to permanent cross-links,kNoneT(d/aNone)2, is smaller than that from entanglements,kNoneT(d/aNone), foraNone less than aNone less than d less than dNone. The two barriers are on the same order atd? dNone? aNone2/aNone. The motion of a very large particle (d greater than dNone greater than aNone) is dominated by permanent cross-links and essentially not affected by entanglements, because the entanglements are under large deformation due to the presence of the very large particle, leading to the slippage of them toward the permanent cross-links, as discussed in detail inAppendix E. Therefore, the particle diffuses as if it is in unentangled polymer networks (see Section2). The crossover atd? dNone? aNone2/aNonebetween entanglement and cross-link dominated regimes can be approximately described by the sum of the two free energy barriersNoneNoneThe terminal diffusion coefficient of particles of different sizes in an entangled polymer network is presented by the solid line in Figure5. Hopping diffusion of a particle in entangled polymer gels is similar to that in entangled polymer networks, with the hopping step sizebreplaced by correlation length xi (eqD.2) and corresponding parameters replaced by concentration dependent ones (seeAppendices DandF). The key elements for hopping diffusion of large particles in entangled polymer gels are summarized in Table1. Particle diffusion coefficient. Dependence of particle diffusion coefficientD(d) on particle sizedin entangled polymer networks (solid line) and entangled polymer melts (dashed line).

Y-axis is logarithmic;X-axis is linear. In our previous work,Nonewe discussed the motion of particles in entangled polymer liquids. Here we revisit this problem taking into account the contribution of hopping to particle mobility. The motion of large particles (d greater than a) in entangled polymer liquids is due to both hopping mechanism and chain relaxation by reptation. In order to diffuse, the particles either have to hop between confinement cages or wait for polymer liquids to flow around these particles. The particle motion is not affected by the entanglements at time scales shorter than the relaxation time tauNoneof an entanglement strand (see Figure6and ref (31)). At time scales longer than tauNone, the large particles are trapped by entanglement cages and cannot move further until a certain time scale tauliq. The physical meaning of the onset time scale tauliqof particle diffusion is determined by the fastest of the two processes that dominates the particle motion at long time scales. The motion of large particles in entangled polymer liquids due to chain reptation process has been discussed in ref (31). In section3, we have discussed the mechanism of hopping diffusion of large particles in entangled polymer solids. These results can be directly applied to describe the hopping diffusion in entangled polymer liquids (melts and solutions) for large particles with sizedlarger than the entanglement strand sizeaNone? bNNone1/2. In the following, we compare the mean-square displacement of large particles in entangled polymer melts due to hopping mechanism and the mean-square displacement due to the chain relaxation (reptation) process.

The motion of large probe particles at time scales shorter than tauNoneis not affected by entanglement. NoneAt time scales longer than tauNonelarge probe particles are trapped by entanglement mesh, but they do not have to wait for the polymer liquids to relax to move further (dash-dotted line); instead, they can diffuse by hopping between neighboring entanglement cages (solid line with unit slope fort greater than tauhopent). Logarithmic scales. The motion of large particles (d greater than aNone) in entangled polymer liquids due to hopping is the same as that presented in section3; the mean-square displacement on time scalet greater than tauNoneis described by eq26.

Assuming no coupling between the two processes (chain reptation and hopping diffusion) the net mean-square displacement of the large probe particle in entangled polymer melts can be written as the sum of contributions from both processesNoneNonein which tauhopentis the crossover time between fluctuation plateau and hopping diffusion (eq26). The corresponding terminal particle diffusion coefficient isNoneNoneThe polymer relaxation (reptation) time increases as power law of the degree of polymerization (eq29), and at the crossover value of the degree of polymerizationNNonethe reptation time taurepbecomes comparable to tauhopent. NoneNoneThe description of particle mobility in entangled polymer melts can be extended to polymer solutions by substituting Kuhn monomer sizebby the correlation length xi (eqD.2) and including concentration dependence of all other quantities,NNone(eqF.3) andaNone(eqF.1) as shown inAppendixF.The mean-square displacement of the large probe particle in polymer liquids with degree of polymerization larger thanNNoneis dominated by the hopping diffusion (see solid line in Figure6). The mobility of probe particles in liquids with shorter polymers (N less than NNone) is dominated by chain relaxation process. Note that the reptation time taurepis independent of the particle size, whereas the time scale tauhopentincreases exponentially with particle sized(see eq26). Therefore, for a polymer solution with fixed polymer lengthNand concentration above the entanglement onset we can introduce the crossover particle sizedNoneNoneNoneat which the hopping time scale tauhopentis comparable to the reptation time taurep. Note that in the second line of eq34, we are assumingdNone? aNone, as the numerical solution of eq34givesdNoneon the order ofaNone. Thus, there is an interval of particle sizes (aNone less than d less than dNone) for which the terminal particle diffusion coefficient is dominated by the contribution from hopping diffusion, whereas for particles with sizedlarger thandNone(see eq34) it is dominated by the contribution from chain reptation process. NoneNoneThe interval of particle sizes (aNone less than d less than dNone) within which the particle motion is dominated by the hopping process is of significant width to be tested by experiments or computer simulations. For instance, the crossover particle size could be of one order of magnitude larger than the tube diameter (dNone? 10aNone) in a highly entangled polymer liquid withN/NNone? 50 entanglements per chain and typical ratio of tube diameteraNoneand correlation length xi ofaNone/xi ? 5. The motion of very large particles with size larger thandNone(eq34) is diffusive with their terminal diffusion coefficient inversely proportional to the bulk viscosity and the particle size. Note that above we describe the dependence of terminal particle diffusion coefficientD(d) on particle sized. By including the concentration and molecular weight dependencies of corresponding parameters, xi,aNone, tauNone, and eta, one can obtain the dependence of particle diffusion coefficientDon solution concentration phi, and degree of polymerizationN(polymer molecular weightM), as discussed inAppendix F. To summarize: (1) There is a range of particle sizes (aNone less than d less than dNone(eq34)) in which the particle motion is mainly determined by hopping diffusion; (2) the hopping diffusion coefficient of large particles decreases exponentially with increasing particle sized(eq27and Table1); (3) very large particles with size greater thandNonehave to wait for polymer liquids to relax and flow around them in order to diffuse. NoneThe dependence of terminal diffusion coefficient of particles on their sizes in an entangled polymer melt is presented by the dashed line in Figure5. Note that microrheological approach works only for these very large particles withd greater than dNone, while for smaller particles it leads to the underestimation of polymer viscosity due to faster particle diffusion by hopping process. In this work, we have discussed the mobility of large particles subjected to topological constraints. The topological constraints could be network cages in unentangled polymer solids (networks and gels), entanglement nets in polymer liquids (melts and solutions), or both entanglements and network cages in entangled polymer solids. We introduce a novel hopping mechanism to describe the diffusion of large particles with sizedlarger than the network mesh sizeaNoneand/or the entanglement mesh sizeaNone. We argue that although the large particles experience the topological constraints from the network (entanglement) cages, they can still diffuse by waiting for the fluctuations of the surrounding confinement cages, which could be large enough to slip around the particle. In unentangled polymer solids (aNone less than aNone) the large particles are trapped by network cages at long time scales (t greater than tauNone). To move (hop) between cages, these particles have to wait for time tauNone, at which the fluctuations of network strands become large enough to allow the particles to hop between cages. The hopping step occurs by just one network loop out of many overlapping ones that slips over the particle. The resulting hopping step size Deltarof a particle is on the order of a monomer size in dry polymer networks or melts and on the order of correlation length in gels and entangled polymer solutions. Note that this hoping step size is much smaller than the network mesh size and is independent of particle sized, which is qualitatively different from prediction in ref (43). Hopping diffusion coefficient of large particles in unentangled networks exhibits exponential dependence on the square of the ratio between the particle size and the network strand size:Dhopnet? (aNone/d) exp (-d2/aNone2). In addition to permanent cross-links, polymer solids can also contain entanglements. Particles diffusing in weakly cross-linked polymer solids are primarily constrained by entanglements. Unlike the chemical cross-links, the constraining effect due to entanglements softens upon chain elongation and thus the corresponding free energy barrier for hopping diffusion between neighboring entanglement cages is weaker. The corresponding diffusion coefficient of large particles (aNone less than d less than dNone? aNone2/aNone) in entangled networks has relatively weaker dependence on particle size,Dhopent? exp (-d/aNone), in comparison to unentangled networks. We would like to stress that our model predicts linear dependence of the hopping energy barrier on particle sized, which is qualitatively different from that in ref (43), in which the hopping barrier is expected to be asymptotically proportional to the particle volumed3. It is worthwhile to note that the barrier height predicted in ref (43) is similar to our estimate for the energy of embedding a particle into the polymer network (Appendix C). In contrast to particle motion in entangled permanently cross-linked networks, for which hopping is the only mechanism allowing long-time diffusion, large particles in entangled polymer liquids can also diffuse by allowing these liquids to flow around them at time scales longer than the relaxation time. We show that particles with intermediate sizeaNone less than d less than dNone(see eq34) diffuse primarily by hopping between neighboring entanglement cages, while extra large particles (d greater than dNone greater than aNone) have to wait for the polymer liquids to relax as the entropic energy barrier for hopping between neighboring entanglement cages becomes extremely high. The hopping process provides the mechanism for diffusion of particles with size several times larger than the mesh size of unentangled polymer networks and tube diameter of entangled polymer solids and liquids. For instance, recent experiments studying the diffusion of gold nanoparticles with size slightly larger than the entanglement length in polystyrene solutions show that the particles experience viscosity smaller than the macroscopic value. NoneIt is possible that the diffusion coefficient of these particles with sized greater than aNoneis due to hopping. We are looking forward to more systematic experimental and computer simulation tests that will provide more information about diffusion of particles with size larger than the network (entanglement) mesh size. Furthermore, a natural extension of the results presented in this paper could be the mobility of particles in reversible polymer liquidsNoneand solids,Nonewhich will be presented in a future publication.
