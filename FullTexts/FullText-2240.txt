There are over 40 species of the genusNone, of which the coagulase-positiveNoneis a major cause of human clinical disease. The population structure ofNoneis well-understood and comprises clonal complexes (CCs) with less than 2 % nucleotide divergence. Recently twoNonelineages have been recovered from human clinical infections (HoltNone, 2011;NgNone, 2009;RuimyNone, 2010;TongNone, 2010), from non-human primates (SchaumburgNone, 2012), and from bats in Africa (AkobiNone, 2012). These lineages have previously been identified asNoneaccording to phenotype, but on the basis of multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) and a single genome sequence, the lineages are allied to but significantly diverged fromNone. We describe here investigations including the use of whole-genome sequence analysis to justify classification as three separate species,None, and two novel species of the genusNone. Strain MSHR1132Twas isolated from blood cultures of an Indigenous patient from Darwin, Australia (HoltNone, 2011); and strain FSA084Twas isolated from the nares of a red-tailed monkey (Cercopithecus ascanius) from Gabon, Africa (SchaumburgNone, 2012). Both strains grew on tryptone soy agar (TSA) at 37 degrees C with large, round, smooth colonies similar to typicalNone. Colonies of FSA084Thave a yellowish-pigmented appearance while those of MSHR1132Tare non-pigmented, displaying a creamy white appearance. The difference in pigmentation between typicalNoneand strain MSHR1132Tis particularly evident after growing on chocolate agar (Oxoid) for 48 h at 37 degrees C (HoltNone, 2011). Strains MSHR1132Tand FSA084Tare both catalase-positive, coagulase-positive by tube coagulase test and colonies demonstrate beta-haemolysis on blood agar. Gram staining tests revealed Gram-stain-positive cocci in clusters for both strains. MLST revealed MSHR1132Tas ST1850 and FSA084Tas ST2022. We also selected for further investigation five strains that clustered according to MLST with MSHR1132T(LBSA043, JABA32044, M260, M051, H115100079) and five that clustered with FSA084T(FSCB1B, FSCB5, FSA096, FSA090, FSA037). The MSHR1132Tlineage strains were all recovered from human hosts from northern Australia (BrennanNone, 2013;McDonaldNone, 2006), Fiji (JenneyNone, 2014) and the UK. The FSA084Tlineage strains were recovered from non-human primates in Gabon and Cote d'Ivoire, Africa (SchaumburgNone, 2012). These additional strains demonstrated the same cell and colonial morphology as MSHR1132Tand FSA084Trespectively. All MSHR1132Tlineage strains appeared non-pigmented. Whole-genome sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq platform of the 12 strains, followed by core-genome single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based maximum-likelihood trees demonstrated that MSHR1132Tlineage strains, FSA084Tlineage strains, and referenceNonegenomes, form three distinct clusters with 100 % bootstrap support (Fig. 1). The details and GenBank accession numbers for these strains are provided inTable 1. Compared toNone, the 16S rRNA gene sequence (1474 nt) is identical in strain MSHR1132Tand differs at one position in strain FSA084T. However, pairwise average nucleotide identity (ANI), as calculated using JSpecies (Richter Rossello-Mora, 2009), across the genomes within and between these groups was consistent with separate species designations (Table 2). Previously it has been demonstrated that an ANI less than 95 % corresponds well to a DNA-DNA hybridization (DDH) value of less than 70 % (GorisNone, 2007). Similarly, an analysis using the GenomeblastDistance Phylogeny (Meier-KolthoffNone, 2013) to calculate genome-to-genome distances clearly demonstrated three separate groups with mean inferred DDH values of 34 % and 36 % betweenNoneand the MSHR1132Tand FSA084Tlineages, respectively, 46 % between MSHR1132Tand FSA084Tlineages, and greater than 80 % within lineages (Table 3). An analysis of orthologous core genes shared by all three groups using Bayesian Analysis of Population Structure (BAPS) software (ChengNone, 2013) demonstrated three BAPS clusters and an absence of admixture between the groups (Fig. 1). All MSHR1132Tlineage strains lacked the carotenoid pigment operon. Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree of whole-genome sequence alignments for MSHR1132Tlineage strains (LBSA043, JABA32044, M260, M051, H115100079), FSA084Tlineage strains (FSCB1B, FSCB5, FSA096, FSA090, FSA037), and referenceNonestrains (JKD6159, RF122, ST398, JH1, MSSA476, TW20, DSM 20231T). The outer circle shading indicates the three Bayesian Analysis of Population Structure (BAPS) groups:None(black), MSHR1132Tlineage (light grey) and FSA084Tlineage (dark grey). Branches with bootstrap support of 100 % are indicated. Values are mean with standard deviation. ANI was calculated using JSpecies (GorisNone, 2007) and inferred DDH with GenomeblastDistance Phylogeny (Meier-KolthoffNone, 2013). Species: 1,None[number of strains (n) = 18]; 2,S. schweitzerisp. nov. (n = 6); 3,S. argenteussp. nov. (n = 6). Results were obtained in triplicate for each of MSHR1132Tlineage (S. argenteussp. nov.) strains, FSA084Tlineage (S. schweitzerisp. nov.) strains, and 18 ATCC strains ofNoneusing a Vitek2 GP Card (bioMerieux); see text for details of strains. Values are the proportion (%) of tests that were either positive or negative for each group of strains. PCR amplification of thenucAgene that is used as a standard confirmatory marker forNoneis positive in strain MSHR1132Tbut negative in strain FSA084T. An examination of thenucAgene and in particular the primer sites fornucA(BrakstadNone, 1992) reveal one and two mismatches for the forward primer, and five and five mismatches for the reverse primer, for MSHR1132Tand FSA084T, respectively (Fig. 2). The presence of mismatches at the 3' end of primers for strain FSA084Tmost likely contributes to the lack of amplification of product for strain FSA084T. There were two in-frame deletions of 9 and 12 bp and one in-frame insertion of 3 bp in both MSHR1132Tand FSA084TnucAsequences compared toNone. Sequence alignment of representativenucAgene sequences. The standard primer sites (BrakstadNone, 1992) are indicated in bold underline (None), light grey shading (S. argenteussp. nov.) or dark grey shading (S. schweitzerisp. nov.). MSSA476 represents a referenceNonesequence, MSHR1132Tand LBSA043 representS. argenteussp. nov., and FSA084Tand FSA090 representS. schweitzerisp. nov.Biochemical profiling was performed with the Vitek2 GP card platform (bioMerieux) according to the manufacturer's instructions. We tested in triplicate each of the 12 strains together with 18 strains ofNonefrom the ATCC collection (ATCC 12600T, 13565, 13709, 14458, 19095, 19636, 23235, 25904, 25923, 27664, 29213, 29247, 33591, 33592, 43300, 49230, 49775, 51811) (Table 3). The biochemical test profiles for both MSHR1132Tlineage strains and FSA084Tlineage strains, are consistent withNone, with mean probabilities of greater than 95 % of identity asNone. Although no test definitively discriminated between the three groups, the following may be helpful in identifying these lineages. The FSA084Tlineage strains were positive ford-ribose in 72 % of tests compared to 4 % and 17 % forNoneand MSHR1132Tlineage strains, respectively. The MSHR1132Tlineage strains were positive for urease in 56 % of tests compared to 0 % for bothNoneand FSA084Tlineage strains. Nonewas positive forN-acetyl-d-glucosamine in 98 % of tests compared to 33 % and 28 % for FSA084Tlineage strains and MSHR1132Tlineage strains, respectively. We attempted to discriminate 12 MSHR1132Tlineage strains (an additional six strains to those already described), 12 FSA084Tlineage strains (an additional six strains to those already described), and 22 consecutive standard clinical strains ofNoneby using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) (Microflex LT MALDI-TOF instrument; Bruker Daltonik) (Table 4). We prepared samples using liquid phase formic acid extraction, according to the manufacturer's recommendations, and compared the spectral profiles gained to the existing Bruker standard clinical database of profiles using MALDI Biotyper 2.1 software (Bruker Daltonik) with default settings. Strains ofNonewere confidently identified. The MSHR1132Tlineage strains and FSA084Tlineage strains profiles were most similar to theNoneprofile, but identity scores were much lower than for the strains ofNone(P less than 0.0001 for both compared toNone) and fell below the manufacturer's recommended threshold for a species level identification. We generated new reference profiles with three MSHR1132Tlineage strains and three FSA084Tlineage strains and repeated the analysis of all 46 strains. All strains were then confidently identified into their different groups. These findings are consistent with the three groups being separate species based on cell proteomic analysis. Identity score values are graded as highly probable species identification (score value 2.300-3.000), secure genus and probable species identification (2.000-2.299) and probable genus identification (1.700-1.999). Values are mean (standard deviation) of identity scores. Analyses of fatty acids, respiratory quinones and peptidoglycans were carried out by the Identification Service of the Leibniz-Institut DSMZ (Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen), Braunschweig, Germany. NoneATCC 29213, MSHR1132Tand FSA084Twere cultured and tested for fatty acid composition under identical conditions. The fatty acid profiles of strains MSHR1132Tand FSA084Twere similar and dominated by anteiso-C15 : 0and anteiso-C17 : 0and corresponded in their composition toNoneATCC 29213 (Table 5). Strains MSHR1132Tand FSA084Tcontained the menaquinones MK-7, MK-8 and MK-9 at ratios of 11 : 70 : 11 plus a non-identified peak (MSHR1132T) and 7 : 80 : 13 (FSA084T). Menaquinones with seven to eight side-chains are characteristic for the genusNone(GotzNone, 2006). Both MSHR1132Tand FSA084Tshowed the same peptidoglycan type (A3alpha type, A11.8 type,l-Lys-l-Ala-(Gly)4-5) (Schleifer Kandler, 1972;Schumann, 2011) (http://www.dsmz.de/?id=449). This peptidoglycan type is reported fromNone(SvecNone, 2004;Zakrzewska-CzerwinskaNone, 1995),None(SchleiferNone, 1983) andNone(KloosNone, 1976), and is distinct from that ofNone(A3alpha type, A11.2 type,l-Lys-(Gly)4-5) (GotzNone, 2006). Strain: 1,NoneATCC 29213; 2,S. argenteussp. nov. MSHR1132T; 3,S. schweitzerisp. nov. FSA084T. Values are percentages of total fatty acids. Differentiation between these two fatty acids was not possible. In Conclusion, although MSHR1132Tlineage strains and FSA084Tlineage strains share identical or near identical 16S rRNA gene sequences, have similar fatty acid and menaquinone compositions toNone, and are phylogenetically the closest known relatives ofNone, there are strong justifications for assigning these lineages to two novel species of the genusNone, for which the namesStaphylococcus argenteussp. nov. (type strain MSHR1132T) andStaphylococcus schweitzerisp. nov. (type strain FSA084T) are proposed. These justifications are: 1) phylogenetic distance, lack of admixture, ANI less than 95 %, and inferred DDH less than 70 %; 2) different profiles as determined by MALDI-TOF MS; 3) non-pigmented phenotype ofS. argenteussp. nov.; 4)S. schweitzerisp. nov. cannot be detected by standardnucAPCR; 5) distinct peptidoglycan types compared toNone; 6) a separate ecological niche forS. schweitzerisp. nov., which has only once been recovered from human hosts to date (SchaumburgNone, 2012); 7) distinct clinical disease profile forS. argenteussp. nov. compared toNone(TongNone, 2013).
