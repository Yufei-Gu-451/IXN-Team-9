Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is recommended for abnormal glucose regulation screening in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) (1). However, OGTT is not satisfactory as a routine test (2,3). Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) has been adopted as a diagnostic criterion for diabetes (4), and HbA1ctesting has some advantages, such as requiring nonfasting samples and having less biological variability (3). On the other hand, the fasting plasma glucose (FPG) test is widely available and inexpensive (3). The performance of HbA1cand FPG in screening for diabetes has only been reported in a limited number of patients with acute coronary disease (5,6). Doerr et al. (7) reported that the sensitivity of HbA1c greater than =6.5% for the detection of newly diagnosed diabetes (NDD) in patients undergoing coronary angiography (CAG) was only 16%. The present study aimed to compare the performance of HbA1cand FPG in screening for diabetes, as determined by an OGTT, and to develop a screening algorithm for patients undergoing CAG. This study was approved by the institutional review board of Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients provided written informed consent before undergoing any study-related procedures. Adult patients without known diabetes were eligible if they were admitted for CAG for suspected or known CAD. Patients with serum creatinine greater than =250 mumol/L, hemoglobin less than 10 g/dL, or history of blood transfusion within 3 months were excluded. CAD was defined as greater than =50% stenosis of the lumen diameter in any coronary artery. Two to four weeks after hospital discharge, a standard 75-g OGTT (8) was performed between 0800 and 1100 h after a 10-12-h overnight fast. Blood samples were collected at 0, 30, and 120 min for the measurements of HbA1cand plasma glucose and insulin concentrations. The methods of laboratory measurements are provided in theSupplementary Data. Patient glucometabolic state was defined based on the results of the OGTT (4). Insulin resistance was calculated with the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (9). beta-cell function was assessed with the homeostasis model assessment of beta-cell function (HOMA-beta) (9) and insulinogenic index (IGI) (10). Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS version 10.0 (IBM, Chicago, IL) software. The performance of HbA1cand FPG for detecting NDD was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, and diagnostic accuracy was assessed with the area under the curve (AUC) (11). P less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. From December 2009-September 2011, OGTT was conducted in 400 of 780 eligible patients (mean age 65 +/- 13 years, male 75.9%, CAD 67.8%) (Supplementary Table 1). Figure 1shows the ROC curves for HbA1cand FPG to detect NDD. Overall, the AUC was higher for FPG than for HbA1c(0.81 vs. 0.73,P= 0.032). The optimal cutoff point was 5.6 mmol/L for FPG and 6.3% for HbA1c. In patients with CAD, the AUC was higher for FPG than for HbA1c(0.81 vs. 0.71,P= 0.017), whereas the difference was not significant in patients without CAD (0.80 vs. 0.79,P= 0.881). ROC curve for HbA1cand FPG to detect NDD in all patients (A), patients with CAD (B), and patients without CAD (C). The optimal cutoff points for HbA1cwere 6.3 (A), 6.2 (B), and 6.3% (C). The optimal cutoff point for FPG was consistently 5.6 mmol/L in all three groups. Patients were divided into different groups according to their FPG and HbA1clevels (Supplementary Table 2). Patients with FPG 5.6-6.9 mmol/L were more insulin resistant (HOMA-IR 2.4 +/- 1.5 vs. 1.7 +/- 1.2,P less than 0.001) and had worse beta-cell function (HOMA-beta 74 +/- 49 vs. 104 +/- 70,P less than 0.001; IGI 60 +/- 57 vs. 104 +/- 87,P less than 0.001) than those with FPG less than 5.6 mmol/L. However, in patients with HbA1c5.7-6.4%, the HOMA-IR, HOMA-beta, and IGI were not significantly different from those in patients with HbA1c less than 5.7%. On the basis of our findings, we proposed a screening algorithm (Supplementary Figure 1). Diabetes was diagnosed in patients with FPG =7.0 mmol/L. OGTT needs to be conducted in patients with FPG 5.6-6.9 mmol/L and may be waived in those with FPG 5.6 mmol/L. In this way, the number of OGTTs was reduced by 71.8%, and the sensitivity and specificity for detecting NDD was 73.5 and 100%, respectively. This algorithm was tested in another 170 patients (mean age 62 +/- 13 years, male 82.9%, CAD 67.1%) admitted for CAG between October 2011 and June 2012. Following this algorithm, an OGTT would be needed in 50 (29.4%) patients, and the sensitivity and specificity for detecting NDD was 76.5 and 100%, respectively. We reported that the AUC was higher for FPG than for HbA1cin detecting NDD in patients undergoing CAG, especially in those with CAD. A recent study comparing the performance of HbA1cand fasting capillary glucose in screening for diabetes in a general Chinese population found a higher AUC for fasting capillary glucose than for HbA1c(men 0.77 vs. 0.67,P less than 0.01; women 0.75 vs. 0.67,P less than 0.01) (12). These findings were in line with the present results and suggest that FPG is a better test than HbA1cin screening for diabetes. We observed that patients with FPG 5.6-6.9 mmol/L were more insulin resistant and had worse beta-cell function than those with FPG less than 5.6 mmol/L. However, in patients with HbA1c5.7-6.4%, the indexes of insulin resistance and beta-cell function were not significantly different from those in patients with HbA1c less than 5.7%. Some studies reported that beta-cell function progressively declined with the increase in either FPG or 2-h postchallenge glycemia (13,14). In contrast, the relationship between HbA1cand beta-cell function was reported to be highly nonlinear (15). These results suggest that a higher-than-normal FPG might be a better index of insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction than a higher-than-normal HbA1c. There are some limitations in this study. First, only 51.3% of eligible patients participated. Second, we did not conduct a second OGTT to confirm the diagnosis, and the poor reproducibility of OGTT (3) may confound the results. Third, the efficacy of the screening algorithm has not been tested in another independent cohort. In summary, we reported that the FPG test performed better than HbA1cin screening for diabetes in patients undergoing CAG. We proposed a screening algorithm, and its efficacy and practicability need further investigation.
