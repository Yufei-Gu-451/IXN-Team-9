Models of photosynthesis are important tools for predicting the response of plants to climate change. The Farquhar, von Caemmerer, and Berry biochemical model of C3photosynthesis was first parameterized to predict photosynthetic rates at 25 degrees C using the kinetic parameters of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (Rubisco), the enzyme responsible for initiating carbon fixation (Farquhar et al., 1980). This model has proven to be robust in predicting the effects of CO2availability on photosynthesis at 25 oC but has been expanded to account for the temperature response of Rubisco kinetics with mixed success (Bernacchi et al., 2001,2002,2003;Sage et al., 2008). For example, the temperature response of the initial slope of the photosynthetic CO2response (A-Ci) curve inPicea marianais less than that predicted by theNicotiana tabacumRubisco kinetic's temperature model (Sage et al., 2008;Way and Sage, 2008). The authors attributed this deviation to a greater deactivation of Rubisco with temperature inP. marianacompared withN. tabacumor to differences in the temperature response of Rubisco kinetics between these species. For accurate modelling, it is important to have correct Rubisco kinetics and assumptions concerning the major fluxes of CO2and O2during photosynthesis. The biochemical model of photosynthesis predicts net leaf CO2exchange from the balance of carbon gain through Rubisco carboxylation with carbon loss through day respiration (Rd) and photorespiration. Photorespiration releases CO2at a given stoichiometry of CO2per oxygenation (alpha), which is assumed to remain constant at 0.5 based on current understanding of photorespiratory biochemistry (Reumann and Weber, 2006). In C3plants, photorespiration releases carbon at approximately 25% the rate of gross CO2fixation, reducing the quantum efficiency of photosynthesis (von Caemmerer and Farquhar, 1981;Sharkey, 1988). Therefore, the CO2compensation point in the absence of day respiration (Gamma*), which quantifies photorespiratory loss of CO2and the kinetic properties of Rubisco, is an essential term in models of photosynthesis (see Equations 2 and 4 below). Gamma*can be measured either biochemically throughin vitroassays orin vivousing gas-exchange methods. Generally,in vivoGamma*is measured with the so-called 'Laisk method' as the intersection ofA-Cicurves measured at multiple subsaturating light intensities (Gamma*L) (Laisk, 1977). The original method described by Laisk did not take into account mesophyll conductance of CO2(gm) (Equation 3) to adjust the intercellular CO2partial pressure (Ci) to the CO2partial pressure at the site of Rubisco (Cc); however, several recent publications have reviewed the importance of includinggmin estimates of Gamma*Land gas-exchange generally (Warren, 2008;Furbank et al., 2009). Alternatively, mass spectrometer measurements of leaf O2isotope exchange can also be used as anin vivoestimate of Gamma*(Gamma*O). This method does not require estimates ofgmbut does require assumptions related to leaf O2exchange and alpha (see Equations 4, 7, and 8) (Ruuska et al., 2000;Bernacchi et al., 2002). O2exchange is typically measured by placing a leaf disk in a sealed cuvette in an18O2atmosphere attached to a mass spectrometer via a membrane inlet (Canvin et al., 1980;Beckmann et al., 2009). The exchange of O2in and out of the leaf is measured by following the uptake of18O2and evolution of the natural abundance of16O2from water splitting during photosynthesis (see Equations 7 and 8). The Gamma*Ocalculations assume that alpha is constant at 0.5, O2consumption from day respiration is the same as in the dark, and rates of photoreduction of O2to water (the Mehler reaction) are negligible (Canvin et al., 1980;Badger, 1985). These assumptions appeared valid at 25 oC when compared with independent measurements of gas exchange and Rubisco kinetics (Ruuska et al., 2000), but their accuracy as temperature increases has not been widely characterized (Badger et al., 2000). Unfortunately, measurements of alpha are inherently difficult because they require determining the rate of CO2release from photorespiration and the rate of Rubisco oxygenation (vo) while Rubisco carboxylation (vc) and CO2release fromRdcontinue in the light. However, at 25 degrees C the post-illumination burst (PIB) and12CO2release following a saturating13CO2injection both scale with photorespiratory CO2release, providing an estimate of the CO2component of alpha (Doehlert et al., 1979;Delfine et al., 1999;Loreto et al., 2001;Cousins et al., 2008,2011). Additionally,vocan be estimated using isotopic exchange of18O2and16O2, but these measurements are subject to the assumptions of O2exchange outlined previously and discussed in the theory section below (Canvin et al., 1980;Badger, 1985;Cousins et al., 2008,2011). Recently, measurements of12CO2release and18O2and16O2exchange indicated an increase in alpha inArabidopsis thalianalacking both isoforms of peroxisomal malate dehydrogenase (pmdh1pmdh2) and peroxisomal hydroxypyruvate reductase (hpr) (Cousins et al., 2008,2011). Despite the importance of Gamma*to gas-exchange models and the value of understanding the temperature response of photosynthesis, to our knowledge there are no published comparisons of Gamma*Land Gamma*Oat ambient and elevated temperatures. Such a comparison would help determine whether the two methods give consistent results and identify which assumptions may need re-evaluating at elevated temperatures. Therefore, this study examined the temperature response of Gamma*Land Gamma*Omeasured inN. tabacum(Bernacchi et al., 2001, 2002). Additionally, the temperature and O2response of Gamma*Land Gamma*Owere measured inA. thalianawild-type (WT) andpmdh1pmdh2hprplants. These data were used to explore the potential physiological explanations for differences between the two measurements of Gamma*, including increases in alpha and changes in O2exchange with temperature. The rate of net assimilation of CO2(A) can be modelled by subtracting CO2released by photorespiration and mitochondrial respiration from Rubisco carboxylation rates:whereRdis the rate of day respiration (Farquhar et al., 1980). Additionally, the Farquhar, von Caemmerer, and Berry biochemical model describes Rubisco-limited photosynthesis as:whereVcmax,Kc, andKorepresent the maximum rate ofvNoneand Michalis-Menten constants for reactions with CO2and O2, respectively (von Caemmerer, 2000). Cccan be calculated from intercellular CO2partial pressure (Ci) usinggmaccording to:Gamma*, the CO2compensation point in the absence of day respiration is described by the Rubisco specificity for CO2over O2(Sc/o), partial pressure of O2(O) and alpha as:Changes in Gamma*affect estimates of net assimilation and, as indicated in Equation 4, are directly proportional toOand alpha. The CO2compensation point in the presence ofRd(Gamma) is expressed as:and is measured as the CO2partial pressure whereAis zero. Photosynthesis at higher CO2partial pressures is not Rubisco limited (Equation 2) but is usually limited by the ability of the Calvin-Benson cycle to regenerate intermediates for carbon fixation due to insufficient production of NADPH. Under these conditions, photosynthesis is dependent on the maximum rate of electron transport (Jmax) and energy demand of photosynthesis and photorespiration according to:The Laisk method of measuring Gamma*(Gamma*L) is limited by the ability to measuregmaccurately to convert measured values ofCitoCc(Equation 3), whereas Gamma*measured on the mass spectrometer (Gamma*O) relies on estimates ofvoandvcand assumes alpha=0.5 (Equation 4) (Ruuska et al., 2000;Bernacchi et al., 2002). In this method,vois determined assuming that rates of O2uptake in the dark are equal to uptake by mitochondrial respiration in the light. Additionally, the total O2uptake by Rubisco is determined assuming 1 mole of O2is consumed from the atmosphere during oxidation of glycolate in the peroxisome for every two oxygenations of Rubisco (Badger, 1985). Therefore, the rate ofvois:Assuming that all electrons from water splitting reduce NADPH forvcandvo(Badger, 1985;Ruuska et al., 2000),vccan be determined by:Subsequently, Gamma*Ocan then be calculated fromvcandvo(Equation 4). Both the Laisk and the O2-exchange method rely on measurements of the net exchange of CO2and O2, respectively, to determine Gamma*assuming that CO2and O2are exchanged primarily through reactions of photosynthesis, photorespiration, andRd. However, there are several other carboxylases and decarboxylations within plant cells, including phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and carbamoyl phosphate synthetase, that could mask the true Gamma*with unaccounted fluxes (Raven and Farquhar, 1990). Whilst these additional fluxes are important physiologically, their rates are typically a tenth to a one-thousandth the rate of CO2flux through Rubisco and have a negligible impact on calculations of Gamma*WTA. thalianaColumbia accession and mutantpmdh1pmdh2hpr(Pracharoenwattana et al., 2007) were grown in a climate-controlled cabinet (Econair Ecological Chambers, Winnipeg, Canada) under a photosynthetic flux density of 300 mumol m-2s-1and 2000 mubar CO2to minimize the phenotype ofpmdh1pmdh2hpr1(Pracharoenwattana et al., 2007). Day/night cycles were 11/13h and 23/18 degrees C. Seeds were cold stratified for 3 d and germinated on sterile agar plates supplemented with MS medium (Plant Media, Dublin, OH, USA) and 1% sucrose. Following cold stratification, plates were placed in the growth chamber for 1 week and the seedlings were then transferred to soil for an additional 3 weeks and fertilized weekly with Peters 20-20-20 (J.R. Peters, Allentown, PA, USA). The youngest fully expanded leaves of 31-40-d-old plants were used for gas-exchange measurements. The Laisk method (Laisk, 1977) was used to measure the apparent compensation point (C*) in WT andpmdh1pmdh2hprplants under differentOat 25 and 35 degrees C. Different O2partial pressures (92, 184, and 368 mbar O2) were generated using O2and N2mixed with calibrated mass flow controllers (model GFC17; Aalborg, Orangeburg, NY, USA). A-Cicurves were measured on a leaf fully enclosed in a 2cm2measuring head (6400-40 Leaf Chamber Fluorometer; Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA) at subsaturating light intensities using a Li-Cor 6400 XT (Li-Cor Biosciences) and thexandycoordinates of these points were used to determineRd(ycoordinate) andC*(xcoordinate). CO2diffusion through the gasket was corrected according to the manufacturer's instructions (Li-cor 6400XT manual version 6). The CO2compensation point in the absence of day respiration (Gamma*) was subsequently calculated fromC*by accounting for mesophyll conductance (gm) andRdaccording to Gamma*=C*+Rd/gm, withgmequal to 0.2 and 0.35mol CO2m-2bar-1at 25 and 35 degrees C, respectively. The value of 0.2mol CO2m-2bar-1at 25 degrees C was the average of severalA. thalianaecotypes measured under various conditions (Tazoe et al., 2011) and this value becomes 0.35mol CO2m-2bar-1at 35 degrees C according to the temperature-response model of (Bernacchi et al., 2002). Rates ofvcandvowere determined from measurements of18O2consumption and16O2evolution according to Equations 7 and 8. 18O2consumption in the light and dark and16O2evolution in the light was measured as described previously (Canvin et al., 1980;Ruuska et al., 2000;Cousins et al., 2008). Briefly, a leaf disc was placed in a temperature-controlled closed cuvette system connected to a mass spectrometer (Delta V; Thermo Scientific) via a temperature-controlled membrane inlet. The cuvette was flushed with N2gas, injected with18O2gas to obtain a given O2partial pressure, and sealed. 18O2consumption and16O2evolution rates were monitored during dark and light periods. The PIB was determined from the maximum transient rate of CO2release in the dark following a 10min period of illumination. The12CO2release was determined in the light from the maximum rate of12CO2released following a saturating injection of13CO2(Delfine et al., 1999;Loreto et al., 2001;Cousins et al., 2008,2011). 13CO2was generated from acid-released13CO2from 98%13CO2/sodium hydrogen carbonate (Sigma Aldrich, St Louis MO, USA). Gamma*was calculated according to Equation 4. A-Cccurves were measured using a Li-Cor 6400 assuming agmof 0.2 and 0.35mol CO2m-2bar-1at 25 and 35 degrees C, respectively (Bernacchi et al., 2002;Tazoe et al., 2011). Measurements were made under saturating illumination (photosynthetic flux density of 1200 mumol m-2s-1) and vapour pressure deficits below 15 mbar at 25 degrees C and 25 mbar at 35 degrees C. TheA-Cccurves were fitted to the leaf photosynthesis model (Farquhar et al., 1980) usingin vivo N. tabacumRubisco constants at 25 and 35 degrees C to determine the effects of changes in Gamma*onVcmaxandJmax(Bernacchi et al., 2001,2002). The Gamma*temperature and O2response was modelled by first changing the scaling constant ofBernacchi et al. (2001,2002) so that the function gave values of Gamma*that matched WTA. thalianaat 25 degrees C. The heat of activation determined previously inN. tabacumBernacchi et al. (2001,2002) was used to model values at 35 degrees C.A four-way analysis of variance (ANOVA;Table 1) was used to determine the influence of genotype, temperature, measurement method, and O2levels on Gamma*using Statistix 9 (Analytical Software, Tallahassee, FL, USA). A three-way ANOVA (Table 2) was used to determine the influence of genotype, temperature, and O2levels on measurements ofvo,12CO2release pervoand PIB pervousing Statistix 9. A two-way ANOVA was used to determine the significance in measured and modelledVcmaxandJmaxvalues (Table 3) using R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna Austria,http://www.R-project.org). Significance was assumed to beP less than 0.05. Effects of using the Laisk or O2-exchange methods to estimate Gamma* on modelling CO2assimilation curves under elevated temperature. Maximum rate of Rubisco carboxylation (Vcmax) and electron transport (Jmax) at 25 and 35 degrees C calculated using standard biochemical models of leaf photosynthesis (von Caemmerer, 2000) with Gamma*Lor Gamma*OfromBernacchi et al. (2001)orBernacchi et al. (2002). The modelledVcmaxandJmaxat 35 degrees C were scaled from 25 degrees C measurements using the temperature-response functions ofBernacchi et al. (2001, 2002). Results are shown as means +/-SE of five leaves from separate plants. Statistical analysis was conducted using a one-way ANOVA; different superscript letters indicate significant differences between alpha assumptions and temperatures atP less than 0.05.

Results are shown as the means +/-SE of three to six leaves from separate plants. The response of Gamma*Lto temperature was modelled as described byBernacchi et al. (2001)using the Laisk method to estimate the temperature response assuming an infinite mesophyll conductance (gm) (Fig. 1, dotted line). This response was then corrected forgmusing the values reported byBernacchi et al. (2002), the temperature response ofRdfromBernacchi et al. (2001), and Equation 3 (Fig. 1, solid line). The dashed line inFig. 1represents the temperature response of Gamma*Oaccording toBernacchi et al. (2002), which was determined from O2exchange using a membrane inlet mass spectrometer assuming a constant stoichiometric release of CO2per oxygenation of 0.5. The 25 oC Gamma*Lvalues were greater than Gamma*Oregardless ofgmand were more responsive to temperature. Modelled response of the CO2compensation point in the absence of day respiration (Gamma*) to temperature and O2. The graph shows the temperature response of Gamma* fromBernacchi et al. (2001)with a correction for mesophyll conductance (gm) (solid line) and with an infinitegm(dotted line). The dashed line represents the response according toBernacchi et al. (2002), which was determined assuming a stiochiometric release of CO2per oxygenation of 0.5. In WTA. thaliana, the photosynthetic parametersVcmaxandJmaxwere calculated (Farquhar et al., 1980;von Caemmerer, 2000) from the net CO2assimilation rates as a function of CO2partial pressures at 25 and 35 degrees C assuming Gamma*L, Gamma*O, and Rubisco kinetics fromBernacchi et al. (2001,2002,2003) (Fig. 2andTable 1). Vcmaxwas not significantly different when Gamma*Lor Gamma*Owas used at 25 degrees C (41.3+/-1.5 mumol m-2s-1for Gamma*Land 38.1+/-0.5 mumol m-2s-1for Gamma*O). However, at 35 degrees C,Vcmaxwas significantly different depending on whether Gamma*L(85.9+/-5.1 mumol m-2s-1) or Gamma*O(70.8+/-2.1mumol m-2s-1) was used for the calculation. Additionally, at 35 degrees C, the modelled temperature response ofVcmaxwas significantly different from the measured values using Gamma*O(Bernacchi et al., 2002) but not Gamma*L(Bernacchi et al., 2001). However, the calculated values ofJmaxwere not significantly different when using either Gamma*Oor Gamma*L. Additional key gas-exchange parameters, including net CO2assimilation, intercellular CO2concentration, stomatal conductance to H2O, and H2O transpiration rates, are presented inSupplementary Table S1(atJXBonline). The CO2response of photosynthesis at 25 degrees C (closed circles) and 35 degrees C (open circles) as measured by a Li-Cor 6400. Chloroplastic CO2partial pressure (Cc) was determined from previously published mesophyll conductance values (with a mesophyll conductance (gm) of 0.2 and 0.35 mmol m-2s-1bar-1at 25 degrees C (Tazoe et al., 2011) and 35 degrees C, respectively. Results are shown as means +/-standard error (SE) of five leaves from separate plants. Gamma*Land Gamma*Owere measured and modelled inA. thalianaWT andpmdh1pmdh2hprplants at 25 and 35 degrees C in response to variousO(Fig. 3). WT values of Gamma*Land Gamma*Oincreased linearly withOat both 25 degrees C (r2=1.0000 for Gamma*Landr2=0.9997 for Gamma*O) and 35 degrees C (r2=0.9982 for Gamma*Landr2=0.9854 for Gamma*O) with a significantly higher Gamma*Lcompared with Gamma*Oat 35 degrees C regardless ofO(Fig. 3A,CandTable 2). There was also a linear response of Gamma*Land Gamma*Oin thepmdh1pmdh2hprplants toOat 25 degrees C (r2=0.9999 for Gamma*Landr2=0.9423 for Gamma*O) and 35 degrees C (r2=0.9979 for Gamma*Landr2=0.9773 for Gamma*O) (Fig. 3B,D); however, there was no significant difference between Gamma*Land Gamma*Oat either temperature (Table 2). The WT Gamma*Land Gamma*Owas lower thanpmdh1pmdh2hprat 25 degrees C regardless ofO(Table 2). However, at 35 degrees C, there was no difference in Gamma*Lbetween the two genotypes, but Gamma*Owas significantly higher inpmdh1pmdh2hprcompared with WT at allO(Table 2). The CO2compensation point in the absence of day respiration (Gamma*) in WT (A, C) andpmdh1pmdh2hpr(B, D)A. thalianaplants under various O2partial pressures at 25 degrees C (closed symbols; A, B) and 35 degrees C (open symbols; C, D) measured using the Laisk method for WT (circles) andpmdh1pmdh2hpr(upward triangles) plants. Measurements of Gamma* using O2exchange are also shown for WT (squares) andpmdh1pmdh2hpr(downward triangles) plants. Solid lines represent predicted Gamma* values fromBernacchi et al. (2001)with a mesophyll conductance (gm) of 0.2 and 0.35 mmol m-2s-1bar-1at 25 and 35 degrees C, respectively. Dotted lines show the results fromBernacchi et al. (2002)with alpha=0.8 for thepmdh1pmdh2hprplants. Results are shown as means +/-SE of three to six leaves from separate plants. Laisk data (25 degrees C) from WT andpmdh1pmdh2hprplants were also presented inCousins et al. (2011). As the model was fitted to WT values of Gamma*Land Gamma*Oat 25 degrees C forBernacchi et al. (2001, 2002), there was good agreement between the measured and modelled values at eachOfor the WT. However, at 35 degrees C, Gamma*Lwas slightly underestimated and Gamma*Owas slightly overestimated byBernacchi et al. (2001). The modelled Gamma*for thepmdh1pmdh2hprplants was adjusted to a higher alpha of 0.8 (Equation 4). At 25 degrees C in thepmdh1pmdh2hprplants, the modelled values fitted Gamma*Lat allOand Gamma*Oat 92 and 184 mbarO(Fig. 3B). However, at 35 degrees C, Gamma*Lwas underestimated by the model ofBernacchi et al. (2001)and Gamma*Owas overestimated by the model ofBernacchi et al. (2002)(Fig. 3D). A membrane inlet mass spectrometer was used to measure rates of CO2and O2isotope exchange in WT andpmdh1-pmdh2hprplants in response to temperature andO. From these measurements, the PIB, the release of12CO2in a saturating13CO2background, and the rate of Rubisco oxygenation (vo) were determined. At 25 and 35 degrees C, there was a significant response ofvotoOfor both genotypes (Fig. 4andTable 3). However,vodid not respond to temperature in WT plants but was significantly different between 25 and 35 degrees C in thepmdh1pmdh2hprplants. In WT plants, thePIB:voratio was significantly lower at 25 degrees C compared with that at 35 degrees C, regardless of O2level, and was significantly lower in WT compared withpmdh1pmdh2hprplants at 25 but not at 35 degrees C across all O2levels (Fig. 5andTable 3). In both genotypes, there was no significant response of PIB:voto O2at 25 degrees C, but at 35 degrees C, the PIB:voratio was higher at 92 mbar compared with at 184 and 368 mbar O2. The12CO2:voratio responded significantly to O2, regardless of temperature and genotype, but decreased with temperature in thepmdh1pmdh2hprplants but not in the WT plants. At 25 degrees C, the12CO2:voratio was greater in thepmdh1pmdh2hprplants compared with the WT plants, but there was no difference between genotypes at 35 degrees C. In summary, at 25 degrees C thePIB:voand12CO2:voratios were higher in thepmdh1pmdh2hprplants compared with the WT plants, but at 35 degrees C, they were not significantly different between genotypes, regardless ofO. Additionally,PIB:vowas significantly higher in the WT plants at 35 degrees C compared with 25 degrees C but did not significantly respond to temperature in thepmdh1pmdh2hprplants. In the WT plants,PIB:vowas different at 92 mbar compared with at 184 and 368 mbar O2but not in thepmdh1pmdh2hprplants. Rates of Rubisco oxygenation (vNone) at the CO2compensation point estimated from measurements of18O2and16O2exchange as described in Materials and methods. Measurements were made at 92, 184, and 368 mbar O2at 25 and 35 degrees C for both WT (A) andpmdh1pmdh2hpr(B)A. thalianaplants. Results are shown as means +/-SE of three to six leaves from separate plants. PIB pervNone(A, B) and12CO2release pervNone(C, D) at various O2partial pressures in WT (A, C) andpmdh1pmdh2hpr(B, D)A. thalianaat 25 and 35 degrees C measured from CO2and isotopic O2with the membrane inlet mass spectrometer. Results are shown as means +/-SE of three to six leaves from separate plants. Bernacchi et al. (2001)measured the temperature response of Gamma*inN. tabacumusing the Laisk method (Gamma*L) (Laisk, 1977) to develop a temperature response model of Gamma*. Measurements of Gamma*Lrequire no assumptions about the photorespiratory stoichiometry of CO2released per oxygenation (alpha) or leaf O2exchange but must be corrected for the difference betweenCiandCcwith values of mesophyll conductance to CO2(gm) (Equation 3). Additionally, the temperature response of Gamma*was measured using O2exchange at Gamma (Gamma*O) (Bernacchi et al., 2002), which does not require values ofgm(see below), but assumes that: (i) alpha is equal to 0.5 (Equation 4), (ii) O2is consumed only by photorespiration and Rubisco oxygenation, (iii) rates of O2consumption byRdare the same as respiration in the dark, and (iv) all electrons passed to NADPH drive either photosynthesis or photorespiration (Equations 4, 7, and 8) (Badger, 1985). Given that all these assumptions are correct, then Gamma*Lshould equal Gamma*O. However, a direct comparison of these two methods of estimating Gamma*has not been conducted, particularly in response to temperature. As noted in several publications, it is important to account forgmto measure Gamma*Laccurately (von Caemmerer et al., 1994;von Caemmerer, 2000;Ethier and Livingston, 2004;Furbank et al., 2009). This is because Gamma*Lis determined from the intercept of severalA-Cicurves measured under subsaturating light conditions. Thexvalue of this intercept representsCiat Gamma*, and theyvalue ofAis negative and represents rates ofRd(Laisk, 1977). To estimate Gamma*L, the values ofCimust be corrected forgmto obtain an accurateCc(Equation 3) (Ethier and Livingston, 2004;Furbank et al., 2009). As Gamma*Lis determined whenAis negative, Gamma*Lbefore accounting forgmis lower than after correcting forgm. The Gamma*Lvalues reported byBernacchi et al. (2001)were uncorrected forgm, meaning that they are lower than thegm-corrected value would be. Therefore, to accurately describe Gamma*the model ofBernacchi et al. (2001)must be corrected for the temperature response ofgm. Alternatively, at Gamma, there is no net photosynthesis and the ratio ofA:gmapproaches zero regardless ofgmvalue (Equation 3). Therefore, becauseAis zero at Gamma, measurements ofCiare equal toCc. Under these conditions, stomatal conductance is similarly negligible andCccan be determined from measured CO2partial pressure inside the sealed cuvette without correcting forgm. Consequently, measurements of Gamma*Oare not sensitive to errors ingm(Equation 4). This latter approach was used byBernacchi et al. (2002)to measure Gamma*independently of assumptions ofgm. To compare these two models of Gamma*at 25 degrees C, the values ofBernacchi et al. (2001)for Gamma*Lwere corrected usinggmaccording toBernacchi et al. (2002). At 25 degrees C, thegm-corrected modelled values of Gamma*Lwere higher than the modelled Gamma*O(Fig. 1) and differences between Gamma*Land Gamma*Oincreased with temperature, highlighting the greater temperature sensitivity of Gamma*Lcompared with Gamma*O. The difference between Gamma*Land Gamma*Ois not explained by potential errors in assumptions ofgmbecause the difference is significant whengmis assumed to be infinite (no restriction to CO2diffusion andCi=Cc) and the discrepancy increases asgmdecreases (Fig. 1). Similarly, any assumed value ofRd(from zero to infinity) also increases the discrepancy between the values of Gamma*LfromBernacchi et al. (2001)and the values of Gamma*OfromBernacchi et al. (2002)(Equation 3). In summary, the temperature response and absolute values of Gamma*Lare higher than Gamma*Oeven when corrected forgmand regardless ofRd. Both of these estimates of Gamma*are used to determine the maximum rate of Rubisco carboxylation (Vcmax) and the maximum rate of electron transport (Jmax) from gas-exchange measurements ofA-Cicurves (von Caemmerer, 2000). Additionally, the temperature response of Gamma*is essential for modelling the response of these parameters and photosynthesis to changes in leaf temperatures. Therefore, it is important to determine how the difference in temperature response of Gamma*betweenBernacchi et al. (2001)andBernacchi et al. (2002)influences estimates ofVcmaxandJmaxderived fromA-Ccmeasurements. To test this,VcmaxandJmaxwere determined fromA-Cccurves measured at 25 and 35 degrees C inA. thalianawith Gamma*from the twoBernacchi et al. (2001,2002) temperature-response models. At temperatures above 25 degrees C, previous publications have attributed lowerVcmaxestimated from leaf gas-exchange measurements compared with modelled values as changes in the Rubisco activation state (Sage et al., 2008). However, some of this difference could also be explained by errors in Gamma*and its modelled temperature response. For example, using thegm-corrected Gamma*LfromBernacchi et al, (2001)to compare measured and modelledVcmaxvalues fromA. thaliana A-Cccurves, there was no significant difference at 35 degrees C (Table 1). However, if Gamma*OfromBernacchi et al. (2002)was used to calculateVcmax, then the measured values were significantly lower than the modelledVcmax(Table I). This could be interpreted as deactivation of Rubisco using Gamma*Obut not with Gamma*L. This difference betweenVcmaxcalculated using Gamma*Lversus Gamma*Ohighlights the importance of determining which method is most appropriate for modelling photosynthesis at different temperatures, as well as understanding which assumptions within the two models are valid in response to changing temperatures. It is possible that the differences in Gamma*L(Bernacchi et al., 2001) versus Gamma*O(Bernacchi et al., 2002) are dependent on the differences in Rubisco content between genotypes used for each study. For example, Rubisco antisense plants were used byBernacchi et al. (2001)to measure the temperature response of Gamma*L. These plants have lowered photosynthetic rates compared with WT plants, which may have introduced errors into measuring the intercept ofA-Cicurves at low CO2partial pressures (Hudson et al., 1992). Indeed, the 25 degrees C value of Gamma*Lof 41.9 mubar CO2from antisense plants measured byBernacchi et al. (2001)is higher than other reports of Gamma*Lmeasured in both WTN. tabacumand other C3plants. For example, Gamma*Lvalues at 25 degrees C typically range between 36.7 and 40.8 mubar CO2(Brooks and Farquhar, 1985;von Caemmerer et al., 1994;Laisk and Loreto, 1996). Additionally, differences between Gamma*Land Gamma*Ocould be driven by errors in the assumptions used to parameterize each method. As previously discussed, Gamma*Lmust be corrected forgm; however, including corrections forgmincreases the difference between Gamma*Land Gamma*O. Alternatively, there are several assumptions used in determining Gamma*Owith unknown temperature responses. For example, measurements of Gamma*Oassume that alpha is constant at 0.5 (Equation 4). Additionally, Gamma*Orelies on measurements ofvNoneandvNone, which require assumptions relating O2exchange to Rubisco reactions (discussed below). Therefore, to test these assumptions at 25 and 35 degrees C, measurements of Gamma*Land Gamma*Owere made inA. thalianaWT and the photorespiratory mutant (pmdh1pmdh2hpr), previously characterized as having an increased alpha, to determine which parameters contribute to the discrepancies between Gamma*Land Gamma*O. Measurements of Gamma*Land Gamma*OinA. thalianawere used to confirm and characterize the differences between the two methods of measuring Gamma*presented byBernacchi et al. (2001,2002) (Fig. 3). InA. thaliana, there was no significant difference between Gamma*Land Gamma*Oin WT plants at 25 degrees C (Table 2). This is different from what was observed previously inN. tabacumwhere Gamma*Ldetermined byBernacchi et al. (2001)was higher than Gamma*OfromBernacchi et al. (2002)at 25 degrees C (Fig. 1). The different response of Gamma*Land Gamma*Oat 25 degrees C betweenA. thalianaandN. tabacumcould be the result of the different genotypes used in each study. As mentioned before,Bernacchi et al. (2001)used Rubisco small-subunit antisense plants, whilstBernacchi et al. (2002)measured WTN. tabacum;however, in the current study, WTA. thalianaplants were used for both estimates of Gamma*. The close agreement of Gamma*Land Gamma*Oin WTA. thalianaat 25 degrees C at a variety ofOvalues provides strong support that the independent assumptions of both methods are valid at 25 degrees C in this species. However, at 35 degrees C, Gamma*Land Gamma*OinA. thalianawere significantly different across allO(Table 2andFig. 3), confirming a similar increased temperature response of Gamma*Lover Gamma*Oas suggested by the comparison of data fromBernacchi et al. (2001,2002). As discussed previously, larger values ofgmincrease Gamma*Lestimated from measuredCivalues (Equation 3); however, regardless of thegmvalues used (0.10 to infinity), Gamma*Lwas always larger than Gamma*O(data not shown). Therefore, errors ingmdo not explain the differences between Gamma*Land Gamma*Oat 35 degrees C. These findings inA. thalianaconfirm differences in Gamma*Land Gamma*Oabove 25 degrees C, although the difference is less than reported inN. tabacum(Bernacchi et al., 2001,2002). To determine whether the different temperature responses of Gamma*Land Gamma*Ocould be explain by changes in alpha the photorespiratory mutantpmdh1pmdh2hprwas compared with WT at both 25 and 35 degrees C.Biochemical models of photosynthesis and measurements of Gamma*O(Equation 4) typically assume alpha=0.5 under all conditions. However, there are several recent publications demonstrating changes in alpha when the traditional photorespiratory pathway is disrupted through genetic manipulation. For example, the photorespiratory mutantspmdh1pmdh2,hpr, andpmdh1- pmdh2hprhad lower net photosynthetic rates under photorespiratory conditions, higher Gamma and higher Gamma*Lthan WT plants (Cousins et al., 2008,2011). Additionally, measurements of CO2and O2isotope gas exchange in thepmdh1pmdh2andhprplants at 25 degrees C confirmed that Gamma and Gamma*Lwere higher due to an increase in alpha (Cousins et al., 2008,2011). Similar to previously published work onhprandpmdh1pmdh2plants, the photorespiratory mutantpmdh1pmdh2hprin this study had higher Gamma*Land CO2release pervocompared with WT plants, indicating an increase in alpha in thepmdh1pmdh2hprplants at 25 degrees C (Fig. 5andTable 3, discussed below). The Gamma*Ovalue in thepmdh1pmdh2hprplants was modelled with alpha=0.8 instead of alpha=0.5, a stoichiometry that also modelled Gamma and Gamma*Lin this and previous studies with photorespiratory mutants with increased alpha (Equation 4 andFig. 3) (Cousins et al., 2008,2011). This suggests that misestimates of alpha can lead to inaccurate calculations of Gamma*O. Measurements of Gamma*L, which do not require assumptions of alpha, in WT plants were significantly lower than inpmdh1-pmdh2hprplants at 25 degrees C; however, at 35 degrees C, the values were not significantly different between genotypes across allO(Table 2). It is expected that theSc/oof Rubisco is conserved between WT andpmdh1pmdh2hprplants at a given temperature (Jordan and Ogren, 1984); therefore, differences in Gamma*Lat 25 degrees C could be attributed to alpha (Equation 4). However, at 35 degrees C, the values of Gamma*Lwere the same between WT andpmdh1pmdh2hprplants, suggesting that alpha may increase with temperature in WTA. thalianato a stoichiometry similar to that inpmdh1pmdh2hprplants. In WT plants, an increase in alpha could also explain why Gamma*Land Gamma*Owere the same at 25 degrees C but Gamma*Owas lower than Gamma*Lat 35 degrees C when assuming alpha=0.5. The linear response of Gamma*Lto O2at 35 degrees C indicated that the increase in alpha would be constant at a given temperature, regardless ofO(Equation 4 andFig. 3). Two putative reactions of photorespiratory intermediates within the peroxisome could explain increases in alpha. Specifically, excess glyoxylate and hydroxypyruvate could react with H2O2releasing CO2, formate, and glycolate with or without an enzyme catalyst (Elstner and Heupel, 1973;Halliwell, 1974). Indeed, this reaction is hypothesized to be a major source of formate in leaves (Igamberdiev et al., 1999). Formate can be further decarboxylated in the peroxisome (Halliwell and Butt, 1974) or oxidized to CO2by formate dehydrogenase in the mitochondria (Hourton-Cabassa et al., 1998), whilst glycolate could re-enter the photorespiratory pathway. These reactions would result in additional CO2release per Rubisco oxygenation and divert carbon from the Calvin-Benson cycle and the regeneration of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate. It has also been hypothesized that, in WT plants, similar increases in alpha occur under elevated temperatures due to an increase in glycolate oxidase activity relative to catalase within the peroxisomes (Grodzinski and Butt, 1977). Additionally, in isolated peroxisomes and mitochondria, an increase in H2O2can react with glyoxylate and hydroxypyruvate leading to an increase release of CO2(Grodzinski and Butt, 1977;Grodzinski, 1978;Hanson and Peterson, 1985). Furthermore, overexpression of catalase inN. tabacumreduced the levels of H2O2and lowered Gamma as temperature increased compared with WT plants (Brisson et al., 1998). These data suggest that alpha could increase from non-catalysed decarboxylation reactions with H2O2, decreasing the efficiency of phosphoglycolate recycling but not completely disrupting the photorespiratory pathway. Therefore, measurements of labelled CO2and O2isotope exchange as described byCousins et al. (2008,2011) were used to determine the influence of temperature on alpha and to probe some of the assumptions of O2exchange used to measure GammaNoneOat 35 degrees C.Rates ofvNoneandvNoneare determined by the relative availability of O2and CO2, Rubisco kinetics, and the activation state of Rubisco (Salvucci and Crafts-Brandner, 2004;von Caemmerer et al., 2004;Sage et al., 2008). It has been shown that Rubisco deactivates under high temperatures, decreasing bothvcandvNone(Kobza and Edwards, 1987;Feller et al., 1998). Deactivation of Rubisco at 35 degrees C could explain the insensitivity ofvNoneto temperature across all O2treatments in WTA. thaliana. However, in contrast to the WT,vNoneincreased with temperature inpmdh1pmdh2hprplants but was constant at 184 and 368 mbar O2at 35 degrees C. This is paradoxical given the apparent decrease in12CO2release pervoinpmdh1pmdh2hprplants under higher Rubisco oxygenation conditions when perturbations to photorespiration would be more severe (Table 3andFig. 5). However, this could be explained by errors in measuringvoand/or photorespiratory CO2release (discussed below). Alternatively, the increase invNonewith temperature inpmdh1pmdh2hprbut not in WT plants could be attributed to changes in O2exchange by alternative oxidations of photorespiratory intermediates traditionally not described as part of the photorespiratory pathway. For example, measurements ofvNonewould decrease if the 2:3 ratio ofvNoneto net O2uptake used in Equation 7 decreased due to additional oxygenation of photorespiratory intermediates. This would subsequently increase the ratios of PIB and12CO2release pervo. These reactions could also explain the apparent discrepancies seen invoand CO2release pervoat 35 degrees C in thepmdh1pmdh2hprplants (Fig. 5). If similar increases in alpha occur in WT plants under elevated temperature due to non-enzymatic or enzymatic reactions, measurements ofvoand CO2release pervowould also be affected. To measure alpha accurately, both the flux of CO2from photorespiration and the corresponding rates ofvomust be determined. The CO2released from photorespiration cannot be measured directly; however, the combined flux from photorespiration andRdcan be estimated from the PIB and by the rate of12CO2evolution following a saturating injection of13CO2on an illuminated leaf (Cousins et al., 2008,2011). As discussed previously, the photorespiratory mutantpmdh1pmdh2hprhad a higher PIB and12CO2release pervoat 25 degrees C compared with WT plants acrossO, suggesting an increased alpha in thepmdh1pmdh2hprplants (Fig. 5andTable 3). However, at 35 degrees C, the PIB pervowas not significantly different between WT andpmdh1pmdh2hprplants (Fig. 5andTable 3). Curiously, PIB pervowas significantly higher at the lowestOcompared with the otherOlevels in both WT andpmdh1pmdh2hprplants. This increase in CO2release pervoat the lowestOwas not expected based on the linear relationship between Gamma*LandO(Fig. 3). The discrepancy between Gamma*Land Gamma*Oand the downward trend in PIB and12CO2release pervoin response toOseen in the WT plants might also be explained by errors in two major assumptions of O2exchange: (i) the O2uptake from day respiration is equal to rates of dark respiration and (ii) the rates of Mehler reaction are negligible. It is generally accepted that rates of respiration in the light (Rd) are less than rates of respiration in the dark (Villar et al., 1994;Lambers and Ribas-Carbo, 2005) and thatRdmay respond to changes in rates of photorespiration (Tcherkez et al., 2008). The Laisk measurements of Gamma*Lcan estimate the CO2release fromRd, which could be used in place of uptake of18O2in the dark in estimates ofvNoneassuming a stoichiometry of CO2evolution to O2uptake during respiration (Equation 7). However, whenRdwas used to calculatevoinstead of the measured dark rates of O2consumption, there was no change in the trends of PIB and12CO2release pervo, as presented inFig. 5, when the stoichiometry of CO2evolution to O2uptake was held constant regardless of the value (comparison not shown). Therefore, there would have to be changes in the stoichiometry of CO2evolution to O2uptake to explain the changes inFig. 5. In addition to differences in dark versus light respiration, higher rates of the Mehler reaction at 35 degrees C could introduce errors in the calculated rates ofvodue to the consumption of O2independent of photosynthesis and photorespiration (Ort and Baker, 2002). This would lead to overestimations ofvo(Equation 7) and underestimations of PIB and12CO2release pervo. The rates of Mehler would have to range from 10% of O2evolution at 92 mbar to 60% at 368 mbar to maintain a constant PIB and12CO2release pervowithO(calculations not shown). However, at 25 degrees C, the rates of Mehler in C3plants are reported to range from 0 to 30% of photosynthetic electron transport at 25 degrees C (Asada, 1999;Badger et al., 2000;Ruuska et al., 2000;Driever and Baker, 2011), but the temperature dependence and O2response of these reactions are not well known forA. thaliana. Measurements of O2exchange under various conditions inN. tabacumfound thatvNoneexplained O2consumption under low and elevated temperatures, suggesting that the Mehler rate does not increase with temperature (Badger et al., 2000). Therefore, the temperature response of the Mehler reactions inA. thalianawould have to be significantly different compared withN. tabacumto explain the downward trend inFig. 5. Finally, the downward trend in PIB and12CO2release pervoin response toOseen in the WT plants at 35 degrees C could be explained if the CO2released from photorespiration does not scale with PIB and12CO2release at elevated temperatures acrossO. In this situation, PIB and12CO2release would no longer be proportional to the CO2released from photorespiration at 35 degrees C in response toO. This would lead to a decrease in the ratio PIB and12CO2release pervoasOincreases that does not correspond to changes in alpha. The observation that PIB saturates with increasingOat 25 degrees C and with temperature supports this suggestion (Doehlert et al., 1979). Therefore, at 35 degrees C, the discrepancy between a constant alpha described by the linear response of Gamma*Land the decreasing trend in PIB and12CO2release pervoasOincreases could be explained by a saturating response of PIB and12CO2release to photorespiratory rates. Unfortunately, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether the downward trend in PIB and12CO2release pervowithOis the result of unaccounted rates of the Mehler reaction, changes in differences between dark and light respiration rates, or saturation of CO2released from photorespiration as measured by PIB and12CO2release. Each of these could individually or collectively affect estimates of PIB and12CO2release pervoin response toO. The data presented here demonstrate differences in temperature-response models of Gamma*fromN. tabacumbetween the Laisk and O2-exchange methods. These differences were large enough to impact both measured and modelled values ofVcmaxandJmax. Differences in Gamma*determined from the Laisk and O2-exchange method were also seen inA. thalianaat 35 degrees C. The difference in estimates of Gamma*were probably due to errors in assumptions used in O2-exchange calculations at elevated temperature. The extent of these errors and the species-specific differences in these assumptions should be considered when modelling the temperature response of photosynthesis with Gamma*values derived from O2exchange.
