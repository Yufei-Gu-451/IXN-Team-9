Current response rates of Ewing's sarcoma family of tumour (ESFT) patients to first-line chemotherapy are as high as 77% (BacciNone, 2000;YonemoriNone, 2007;GasparNone, 2012;SerloNone, 2012), demonstrating that some ESFTs are chemoresponsive. However, others are resistant to chemotherapy at diagnosis (23%), and this is known as intrinsic resistance. Despite the high response rate, 20-40% of patients experience disease recurrence (AhrensNone, 1999;CotterillNone, 2000;Rodriguez-GalindoNone, 2007;StahlNone, 2011) and only 10-23% are alive at 5 years (BarkerNone, 2005;Huang and Lucas, 2011;StahlNone, 2011). The survival of drug-resistant clones after initial chemotherapy and the high occurrence of relapse have been attributed to the development of acquired drug resistance. The ability to evade cell death in this way represents a major challenge for improving patient outcome and survival. Several mechanisms have been implicated in the development of resistance, including the efflux of agents (SeidelNone, 1995;Panyam and Labhasetwar, 2003) by multidrug resistance (MDR) ABC transporter proteins (OdaNone, 1997), in particular the overexpression of Pgp and MRP-1. Increased expression of these efflux proteins results in the removal of chemotherapeutic agents from the cell, reduced effectiveness of chemotherapeutics and decreased survival (BurgerNone, 2003). To date, Pgp is the only MDR protein to have been investigated in ESFTs. However, the results of published studies are contradictory, one suggesting that Pgp was not predictive of prognosis (PerriNone, 2001) and a second significantly linking expression of Pgp to poor response to chemotherapy (RoessnerNone, 1993). Therefore, in this study we have investigated the hypothesis that intrinsic drug resistance in primary ESFTs is mediated through the expression of the ABC transporter proteins Pgp and MRP-1, and that these may be predictive of patient outcome and response to therapy. As functional splice variants of MRP-1 have been described in some normal and cancer cells (ColeNone, 1992;GrantNone, 1997;HeNone, 2004), we have also examined for the first time whether this arises in primary ESFTs, and whether the pattern of spliced variants might be prognostic. Forty-nine cases with a confirmed diagnosis of primary ESFTs, made by independent pathology review and by reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) detection of theEWS-ETSgene rearrangement or CD99 positive by immunohistochemistry (IHC), were included in the study (Table 3). Clinical data were provided by the Children's Cancer and Leukaemia Group Data Centre, University of Leicester. Information was sought on the diagnosis date, date of relapse or death and current disease status. Patient age at diagnosis ranged from 2 to 38 years, with a median age of 13 years, and patients were 22 men and 25 women. Tumours were collected from 1993 to 2006, mounted in optimum cutting temperature (OCT) and stored in liquid nitrogen. Informed consent and ethical approval was obtained for the use of frozen tumour material in these biological studies (MREC 98/4/023, dated 24 July 2001). The substrate-adherent Ewing's sarcoma TTC 466 and the neuroblastoma (NB) SK-N-SH cell lines were obtained and cultured as previously described (Roundhill and Burchill, 2012). Both cell lines are yeast-, bacterial- and mycoplasma-free and are determined every 4 months using the EZ-PCR mycoplasma test kit (Geneflow, Lichfield, UK). The breast adenocarcinoma was obtained from a local anonymised pathology tissue archive (LREC approval, dated 17 July 2001). Immunohistochemistry for MRP-1 expression was performed on 47 tumours (DalalNone, 2005). Sections (5 mum), fixed using methanol:acetone (1 : 1; Merck Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA) for 2 * 2 min at room temperature on glass slides, were incubated with a polyclonal MRP-1 antibody (20 mug ml-1; A23, Axxora, Exeter, UK) and diluted in antibody diluent (DakoCytomation, Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) for 1 h, followed by an incubation with a secondary antibody (1 mug ml-1, goat anti-rabbit; DakoCytomation; diluted in antibody diluent) for 30 min, both at room temperature. Breast adenocarcinoma was used as a positive control for MRP-1 expression; optimum antibody concentration was determined empirically. Pgp expression was detected in acetone-fixed (4 degrees C for 10 min) sections (5 mum) by using the EnVision+ System-HRP (DAB) kit (DakoCytomation). Sections were incubated with Pgp antibody (10 mug mul-1; JSB-1, Axxora) and were diluted in antibody diluent overnight at 4 degrees C. The SK-N-SH NB cell sections (5 mum), mounted in OCT compound, were used as a positive control for Pgp expression; optimum antibody concentration was determined empirically. All sections were visualised using the Liquid DAB Substrate Chromogen System for peroxidase (DakoCytomation) and were counterstained with haematoxylin. Sections were visualised by light microscopy (Zeiss Axioplan microscope; Zeiss, Cambridge, UK). MRP-1 and Pgp expression were scored manually by two independent reviewers, using light microscopy to visualise the sections; each reviewer was blind to the clinical outcome data. MRP-1 expression was scored as the number of positively stained cells out of 100 in 4 randomly selected areas of each tumour; the number of cells with membrane localisation was also scored. Cells were scored as positive or negative for Pgp. Frozen primary ESFT were stained with haematoxylin, ESFT cells captured by laser capture microdissection (LCM). RNA and DNA from the cell lines were extracted as previously described, and quality and quantity were examined (BrownhillNone, 2007). For the analysis of ABC transporter mRNA expression by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), 10 ng or 1 ng per 1 mug of cell line RNA was amplified for MRP-1 and Pgp, respectively; 5 ng of RNA from LCM primary tumour was amplified for MRP-1 and Pgp. Total RNA was reverse transcribed using Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen;Roundhill and Burchill, 2012). Samples were analysed in triplicate and in the absence of RT enzyme or without sample RNA (replaced with DNase-/RNase-free H2O; Invitrogen), to control for non-specific amplification of DNA and contamination, respectively. Complementary DNA was added to a PCR mix containing sequence-specific reverse and forward primers (Supplementary Figure 1) and 1 * TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Invitrogen). Samples were denatured for 2 min at 50 degrees C, Taq polymerase was activated by heating for 10 min at 95 degrees C and cDNA amplified using 40 cycles of 95 degrees C for 15 s and 60 degrees C for 1 min. mRNA expression was calculated using the comparative Ct method (BrownhillNone, 2007), relative to the housekeeping genes beta-2-microglobulin (BrownhillNone, 2007) and peptidylprolyl isomerase A (PPIA) (FischerNone, 2005;LastowskaNone, 2007), in cell lines (Supplementary Figure 2) and primary ESFTs, respectively. TTC 466 and SK-N-SH cell line RNA was included as a reference control for interassay variability in the amplification of MRP-1 and Pgp, respectively. Total RNA (500 ng or 10 ng from cell lines (Supplementary Figure 2) and primary ESFTs, respectively) was reverse transcribed as previously described (Roundhill and Burchill, 2012) and cDNA added to a PCR mix containing MRP-1 exon-specific primers (Supplementary Figure 1) and 1 unit of AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase in 1 * AmpliTaq Reaction Buffer II (Invitrogen). The AmpliTaq gold was activated by one cycle at 95 degrees C for 10 min and cDNA amplified for 35 cycles of 95 degrees C for 30 s, 60 degrees C for 30 s and extension at 72 degrees C for 1 min. This was followed by a further final extension at 72 degrees C for 10 min. PCR products were separated by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis and were visualised after staining with ethidium bromide (0.5 mug ml-1; Sigma-Aldrich Company Ltd., Dorset, UK), under UV light. The prognostic value of MRP-1 and Pgp expression, and one or more MRP-1 splicing events, was evaluated using the Cox proportional hazards model; results withP-values less than 0.05 were considered significant. Overall survival (OS) was calculated as the time from diagnosis to the date last seen, regardless of the number of events that may have occurred. Event-free survival was defined as the time from diagnosis to the time of first event; the first event could be relapse, death or date last seen for surviving patients. Patients without time to a first event or OS follow-up data were excluded from analyses; clinical follow-up information was available in 33 out of 38, 39 out of 44 and 44 out of 47 patients for alternative splicing, qRT-PCR and IHC, respectively. There was limited tumour tissue available from some patients and, hence, it was not possible to analyse all tumours for alternative splicing, protein and mRNA. The statistical methodology used to identify the optimal cut-point to maximise the difference in OS and time to a first event between patient groups with high and low MRP-1 expression is as previously described (LondonNone, 2005). Briefly, each decile of MRP-1 expression was evaluated for a statistically significant difference in OS and time to a first event. Specific associations between RNA and protein levels, and between individual splicing events, were determined by Spearmann's rank and Pearson's correlations, respectively. MRP-1 was expressed in 91% (43 out of 47) of the primary ESFTs analysed (Figures 1A and B); staining was absent in 4 out of 47 ESFTs (Figure 1C). The pattern of MRP-1 expression was similar across each tumour sample. Samples either expressed intracellular MRP-1 only (which was cytoplasmic and/or nuclear, 5 out of 43;Figure 1A), or both intracellular and membrane-localised MRP-1 (38 out of 43;Figure 1B). No tumour expressed MRP-1 in the membrane alone. MRP-1 total protein (MRP-1T) or membrane protein (MRP-1Mem) expression was not predictive of response to therapy measured by necrosis (MRP-1T,P=0.34; MRP-1Mem,P=0.09). However, MRP-1Membut not MRP-1Twas predictive of time to a first event (MRP-1T,P=0.096; MRP-1Mem,P less than 0.0001; cut-off upper 10% high expressers;Figure 1D) and OS (MRP-1T,P=0.75; MRP-1Mem,P less than 0.0001; cut-off upper 10% high expressers;Figure 1E) in these patients. All mRNAs from primary ESFTs (44) successfully amplified for the endogenous control gene PPIA (mean Ct=25, range=21-30), confirming the quality of the tumour RNA. Expression of MRP-1 mRNA was heterogeneous in primary ESFTs and was detected in 82% (36 out of 44) of tumours (Figure 2A; mean Ct=33, range 30-39). MRP-1 mRNA was detected in three out of four MRP-1-negative tumours. The level of MRP-1 mRNA was not predictive of response to therapy measured by necrosis (P=0.82) but was a predictor of time to a first event (P=0.03, 0.15; cut-off upper 20% and 10% high expressers, respectively;Figure 2B), but not OS (P=0.1; cut-off upper 10% high expressers;Figure 2C). There was no significant correlation between MRP-1 mRNA and MRP-1T(r=0.11) or MRP-1Mem(r=0.06) expression. Pgp protein expression was identified in only 6% (3 out of 47) of the primary ESFTs analysed (Figures 3A and B), where expression was observed in the cell membrane and cytoplasm. Pgp was not expressed in the nucleus. Pgp protein expression was not predictive of patient response to treatment measured by necrosis (P=0.64), time to a first event (P=0.60) or OS (P=0.28). In contrast, Pgp mRNA was detected in 86% (38 out of 44) of tumour samples analysed (Figure 3C; mean Ct=34, range=30-39). The level of Pgp mRNA was not predictive of response to therapy measured by necrosis (P=0.22), time to a first event (P=0.25; cut-off upper 10% high expressers) or OS (P=0.20; cut-off upper 10% high expressers). Similar to MRP-1, there was no correlation between Pgp mRNA and protein expression (P=0.81). A cohort of primary ESFTs were analysed for both MRP-1 and Pgp, mRNA and protein. There was no correlation between the Pgp protein expression and membrane (P=0.97) or total (P=0.64) MRP-1 expression. However, there was a significant correlation between the levels of Pgp and MRP-1 mRNA (P=0.026). Alternative splicing of MRP-1 was observed in 63% (24 out of 38) of tumours (Figure 4andTable 1). In all MRP-1 protein-positive samples, the full-length PCR product was amplified (Figure 4andTable 1). The statistically significant paired exon losses (e.g., exon 5 and 6 together) are summarised inTable 2. Table 3There is no correlation between the number of splicing events and the MRP-1 mRNA by RT-PCR (r2=0.1378,P=0.4159) and MRP-1MEMexpression (r2=0.3070,P=0.0646) in primary ESFTs. However, MRP-1MEMand mRNA expression were significantly associated with loss of exons 5 or 6 (r2=0.3440,P=0.0371) and exon 17 (r2=0.3551,P=0.0336), respectively, suggesting that in conditions of high MRP-1 expression pre-RNA splicing may increase. Although the loss of exons 6, 9, 23 and 29, which was frequently observed in this sample group, resulted in a frame shift (Table 1), which we anticipate would produce a non-functional protein, there is no correlation between time to a first event, OS and the number of or a particular splicing event (P greater than 0.05). However, interestingly, patient relapse was significantly associated with loss of exon 9 (P=0.041) (Table 2). Cell membrane expression of MRP-1 in ESFTs at diagnosis strongly predicts for time to a first event and OS, consistent with the hypothesis that cell membrane MRP-1 is in part responsible for drug resistance in ESFT. This is the first study of total and membrane MRP-1 expression and prognostic value in primary ESFTs. MRP-1 protein was expressed in the nucleus and cell membrane of primary ESFTs, consistent with reports in other cancer types (IzquierdoNone, 1995;MaraldiNone, 1999;MolinariNone, 2002). Total MRP-1 expression did not correlate with time to first event, OS or necrosis, which is in agreement with previous studies evaluating total MRP-1 expression in paediatric and adult cancers (IzquierdoNone, 1995;FilipitsNone, 1997;StyczynskiNone, 2007). Similar to the current study, MRP-1 mRNA expression has been associated with time to a first event and OS in NB (NorrisNone, 1996;HaberNone, 2006) and a panel of other childhood malignancies (PlasschaertNone, 2005;SchaichNone, 2005). However, in adult cancers, such as breast and ovarian carcinomas, MRP-1 mRNA expression was not predictive of time to a first event (IzquierdoNone, 1995;BurgerNone, 2003), OS (PlasschaertNone, 2005) or necrosis (BurgerNone, 2003), suggesting that MRP-1 may be more important in cancers of young people than in adult disease. Whether this reflects the developmental origin of the cancers requires further investigation. Pgp was expressed in only 3 put of 47 primary ESFTs; whether this reflects methylation of theMDR1gene as in ESFT cell lines (Supplementary Figure 2) remains to be seen. In agreement with the current work,PerriNone(2001)did not observe a correlation between Pgp protein expression and time to a first event (P=0.87) or OS (P=0.79) in patients at diagnosis. However, protein expression of Pgp has been associated with poor response to therapy (P less than 0.08;RoessnerNone, 1993) in pre- and post-diagnosis ESFTs. Unfortunately, in this study the authors failed to distinguish between pre- and post-treatment groups, which might explain the difference in study conclusions. Increased Pgp protein expression has however been linked to an adverse OS in other paediatric (BaldiniNone, 1995;FilipitsNone, 1997) and adult cancers (MignognaNone, 2006). We have also shown that Pgp mRNA expression was not predictive of patient outcome, in agreement with previous studies in children with NB (NorrisNone, 1996;HaberNone, 1997). In contrast, Pgp mRNA expression in some paediatric and adult cancers taken at diagnosis has been associated with a worse OS (SchaichNone, 2005), time to a first event (BurgerNone, 2003;KourtiNone, 2007) and response to treatment (BurgerNone, 2003). As Pgp protein was expressed in only 3 out of 47 tumours, we agree it is difficult to conclude on the prognostic value of Pgp in the current study cohort. What we can conclude is that MRP-1 is the dominant predictive MDR protein in ESFTs taken at diagnosis. Whether Pgp is of additional predictive value at diagnosis in a small group of patients or has a role in drug-induced resistance remains to be seen. Although significant correlations between the mRNA and protein expression of MDR proteins have been described (NooterNone, 1995;CaiNone, 1999;YangNone, 2002;LacuevaNone, 2005;HaberNone, 2006), in the current study there was no correlation between Pgp protein and mRNA, or full and membrane MRP-1 protein and mRNA in primary ESFTs. These MDR proteins are highly posttranscriptionally regulated by processes such as methylation (KantharidisNone, 1997;AndoNone, 2000;QiuNone, 2007). This is supported by the regulation of Pgp expression in cell lines by methylation ofMDR1(Supplementary Figure 2). No correlation was observed between total MRP-1 and Pgp protein expression, consistent with post-transcriptional regulation of the two proteins (HipfnerNone, 1997;Zhou, 2008). In agreement with previous studies (AlmquistNone, 1995;NooterNone, 1995;LuNone, 2004), we observed a significant correlation between MRP-1 and Pgp mRNA, possibly highlighting a similar mechanism of transcriptional regulation. Interestingly, decreased expression of miR-326 and miR-451 has been associated with increased MRP-1 and Pgp expression, respectively, regulating gene transcription through the 3'-UTR of the ABC transporter proteins (KutanziNone, 2011). In addition, the chromosome rearrangement EWS-FLI1 (Burchill, 2003) has been shown to increase EYA3 through miR-708 (RobinNone, 2012). We are currently investigating the role of micro-RNAs in the development of MDR. In this study, we have described for the first time the presence of MRP-1 splice variants in primary ESFTs. We found loss of exon 9 was predictive of patient relapse (five out of six patients remained in continuous complete remission) and so represents a prognostic marker that requires further investigation. Although splicing of MRP-1 has not previously been correlated with patient outcome, alternative splicing of P73 has been identified as a negative prognostic marker in patients with NB (RomaniNone, 2003). In contrast, upregulation of the alternative MDM4 and MDM2 splice variants, described in soft tissue sarcomas (BartelNone, 2005) and breast cancer patients (LukasNone, 2001), have both been correlated with poor OS (LukasNone, 2001;BartelNone, 2005). Alternative splicing of exons 10-19 and exons 5, 13, 17, 18 and 30 in addition to WT MRP-1 expression, has previously been described in a range of cell types (GrantNone, 1997) and ovarian cancers (HeNone, 2004), respectively. We also identified pre-RNA splicing of MRP-1 in both cancer and normal cell lines (Supplementary Figure 2), suggesting that splicing of MRP-1 is not a cancer-specific phenomenon. Interestingly, the splicing of 10 specific exons occurred at a significantly higher frequency in cell lines (Supplementary Figure 2) than in primary ESFTs, most likely reflecting changes in MRP-1 splicing following the adaptation of cellsin vitro. Loss of exons 3, 5, 17 and 18 result in the loss of whole amino acids and loss of exons 6, 9, 23 and 29 each result in a frame shift, all of which have been observed in this study and are likely to produce a non-functional protein. In agreement with this, MRP-1 splice variants missing each of exon groups 12-26, 17 and 18, 5 and 30 were reported to all confer drug resistance in HEK293T cells when overexpressed, although the effect was not as significant as that of the full-length MRP-1 (HeNone, 2004). Although in this study we have not investigated the regulation of alternative splicing, overexpression of the splicing factors PTB and SRp20 (HeNone, 2004) have been linked to increased MRP-1 splicing. Furthermore, the level oftrans-acting andcis-elements, and the effects of external stimuli, have been reported to determine the accuracy of pre-mRNA splicing (Maniatis and Tasic, 2002), although the mechanism controlling these are not yet understood. Although some studies have suggested that EWS-ETS fusion proteins (Burchill, 2003) inhibit splicing of pre-RNA (YangNone, 2000a,2000b), EWS-FLI1 specifically has been shown to directly interact with the splicing factors U1C and SF1 (Knoop and Baker, 2001), and has been reported to increase transcript levels of cyclinD1b in ESFT cells through alternative splicing (SanchezNone, 2008). Whether this is the case for MRP-1 in ESFT cells requires further investigation. In addition to full-length MRP-1 protein, we have also identified novel shortened MRP-1 protein products (MRP-1-100); products of 65-190 kDa have been reported in a range of other cancer types (KrishnamacharyNone, 1994;ReginaNone, 1998;NutiNone, 2000;FernettiNone, 2001). As we have observed splicing of the MRP-1 pre-RNA in ESFT cell lines, it is possible that MRP-1-100 represents a protein product of alternative splicing, although this requires further investigation. Interestingly, alternatively spliced pre-RNA transcripts have been described in other members of the ABC transporter family, such as Pgp (DevineNone, 1991), BCRP (NakanishiNone, 2006), ABCG1 (EngelNone, 2006) and ABCA1 (BocchiNone, 2010), and have been associated with a change in protein activity, suggesting that abnormal splicing may represent an additional mechanism of ABC transporter expression control. Although a variety of other mechanisms of MDR have been described in ESFTs, including defective DNA repair (AlldingerNone, 2007), overexpression of anti-apoptotic proteins (BatraNone, 2003), glutathione metabolism (ScotlandiNone, 2009) and the presence of cancer-initiating cells (SuvaNone, 2009), the results of this study suggest that targeting the ABC transporter protein MRP-1 may be important to improve the response to therapy and survival for relapsed ESFT patients. High MRP-1 cell membrane protein expression might be useful to identify those patients that are most likely to benefit from more aggressive treatment, combination treatment with standard chemotherapeutics and MRP-1 inhibitors, or treatment with a non-MRP-1 substrate (Roundhill and Burchill, 2012). Similarly, patients with low MRP-1 or loss of MRP-1 exon 9 could be spared unnecessary toxicity, while decreasing the cost of treatment. Before any clinical benefit can be realised, it is now important to validate cell membrane MRP-1 and loss of exon 9 as a predictive marker in ESFTs, and to determine the independent clinical significance of these findings.
