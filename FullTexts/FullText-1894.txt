Previous studies identified high frequencies of activating somatic mutations in theGNAQandGNA11genes in uveal melanoma (OnkenNone, 2008;BauerNone, 2009;Van RaamsdonkNone, 2009b,2010). GNAQandGNA11encode the heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein G subunit alpha q and 11, respectively. Mutations inGNAQ, or its paralogGNA11(together referred to as Galphagenes), occur mutually exclusively in codon 183 (exon 4) or 209 (exon 5), leading to a constitutive activation of the MAP kinase (MAPK) pathway (Van RaamsdonkNone, 2009a,2010). Limited information is available on correlation of the mutations with survival. We examined to what extent oncogenicGNAQandGNA11mutations are correlated with the patient survival. Uveal melanomas were collected from enucleated patients at the Erasmus University Medical Centre and the Rotterdam Eye Hospital (Rotterdam, the Netherlands). Informed consent was obtained before the operation, and the study was performed according to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. Fresh tumour material was obtained within 1 h of enucleation and processed for fluorescencein situhybridisation as described previously (KilicNone, 2005). Part of the tumour was snap-frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen. The remainder of the eye was embedded in paraffin. All tumours were histopathologically confirmed. Only tumours located in the ciliary body and choroid were included in this study. Fluorescencein situhybridisation analysis was performed on directly fixated tumour cells for chromosome 1, 3, 6 and 8 using centromeric or locus-specific probes (KilicNone, 2005). High-resolution whole-genome analysis was performed on tumour-derived DNA, using the Illumina BeadChip HumanCytoSNP-12 v2 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Filtering, normalisation and data analysis were done using version 6 of the Nexus software program (Biodiscovery, Inc., El Segundo, CA, USA). In total, 92 patients were selected for whom follow-up and clinical, histopathological, and cytogenetic data were available. To examine tumour content, H E staining was conducted on a 5-mum section of snap-frozen tumour. Depending on the size of the tumour, 10-15 sections of 20 mum were used for DNA isolation using QIAmp DNA-mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA concentration was measured with the NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA). In a previous study, our group performed mutation analysis ofGNAQexon 5 in 75 samples (BauerNone, 2009). In the present study, we amplifiedGNAQexon 5 in 17 other tumour samples with PCR using the primers 5'-ACCATTTTGCTTGGCACAGATAAGG-3' and 5'-GTAAGTTCACTCCATTCCCCACACC-3'. GNAQexon 4 andGNA11exon 4 and 5 were amplified using the primers: 5'-TCTTTTTCTCCCACCCCTTGC-3' and 5'-TTGTTTTGAAGCCTACACATGATTCC-3' to examineGNAQexon 4; 5'-GTGCTGTGTCCCTGTCCTG-3' and 5'-GGCAAATGAGCCTCTCAGTG-3' to examineGNA11exon 4; and 5'-GATTGCAGATTGGGCCTTGG-3' and 5'-TCTCCTCCATCCGGTTCTGG-3' to examineGNA11exon 5. PCR products were purified using ExoSAP-IT (USB, Staufen, Germany) and sequenced using BigDye Terminator chemistry v3.1 on an ABI Prism 3130xl Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Sequences were aligned and compared with reference sequence hg19 from the Ensemble genome database (ENST00000286548 and ENST00000078429) using SeqScape software version 2.6 (Applied Biosystems). The primary end point for disease-free survival (DFS) was defined as the time to the development of metastatic disease, whereby death due to other causes was treated as censored. The influence of single prognostic factors on DFS was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method (for categorical variables) or the Cox proportional hazard analysis (for continuous variables). To identify the independent value of the prognostic factors on DFS, we used a multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis with a forward stepwise method based on likelihood ratios. An effect was considered significant if theP-value was ?0.05. The statistical analyses were performed with the SPSS software version 20.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). A total of 92 patients were included in the study. Forty-eight of the patients were male and 44 were female. The median age was 62 years (range 21-86); the mean largest tumour diameter was 13.3 mm (range 7.0-19.0) and the mean tumour thickness was 8.3 mm (range 1.5-22.0). On the basis of cell type, 15 tumours were classified as epithelioid, 38 as mixed, and 39 as spindle-cell tumours. Most tumours were localised in the choroid; only six were localised in the ciliary body. The mean follow-up was 74.9 months (range 5.2-200.5), and 44 patients developed metastases, from which 39 died. Sixteen patients died due to another cause, and 32 patients were still alive at the end of the study. All uveal melanomas were analysed forGNAQandGNA11mutations and for chromosomal aberrations in chromosome 1, 3, 6, and 8. No mutations were found inGNAQexon 4. Forty-six tumours (50.0%) harboured a mutation inGNAQexon 5 codon 209; details are shown inTable 1. Although only one mutated case was found inGNA11exon 4, 39 tumours (42.4%) harboured a mutation inGNA11exon 5. Six out of 92 tumours contained no mutations in exons 4 and 5 of both genes. One tumour (EOM-0179) showed two mutations inGNA11exon 5 (resulting in p.Q209L and p.R214M). Tumour sample EOM-0179 was therefore subjected to deep sequencing with a custom-designed HaloPlex Target Enrichment kit for Illumina (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), and both variants were located within the same read (Koopmanset al, manuscript in preparation). No DNA from blood of this patient was available to determine whether variant R214M is a germline variant. Therefore, we isolated DNA from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded retina tissue, and Sanger sequencing ofGNA11exon 5 revealed a wild-type status. Univariate analyses showed that the DFS was significantly shorter in patients with tumours with loss of chromosome 3, loss of chromosome 8p and gain of chromosome 8q. The DFS in patients with tumours harbouringGNAQorGNA11mutations was not significantly less than that in the wild-type tumours (Figure 1). Correlations between the clinical and histopathological parameters, chromosomal parameters, andGNAQandGNA11mutations using the Fisher's exact test and the Mann-Whitney test showed a weak association between age and bothGNAQandGNA11mutation status (P=0.017 and 0.004, respectively;Table 2). GNA11mutation status was also correlated with loss of chromosome 6q (P=0.045). We examined the possibility thatGNAQandGNA11mutations may affect the prognosis of patients with monosomy 3 by constructing Kaplan-Meier curves for changes in chromosome 3, stratified forGNAQandGNA11mutations. Log-rank tests showed that there was no significant effect on the DFS in tumours with loss of chromosome 3 and the presence ofGNAQorGNA11mutation (P=0.745). Multivariate models were constructed forGNAQandGNA11separately with positive variables from the univariate analysis. The presence of epithelioid cells, largest tumour diameter, involvement of the ciliary body, chromosome 3 loss, chromosome 8p loss, and mutations inGNAQ(P=0.587) orGNA11(P=0.796) were rejected. Only the variable chromosome 8q gain (HR 6.562,P=0.000 for bothGNAQandGNA11mutation status) and chromosome 6p gain (HR 0.419,P=0.014 for bothGNAQandGNA11mutation status) were independent predictors of DFS. In this study, we investigated whetherGNAQandGNA11mutations in uveal melanoma are associated with patient survival. We found that these mutations occur mutually exclusive in the majority of uveal melanomas, up to 93.4%, which is in the same range as reported previously (OnkenNone, 2008;BauerNone, 2009;Van RaamsdonkNone, 2009b,2010). Van RaamsdonkNone(2010)suggested thatGNA11mutations might have more potent effect on melanocytes than mutations inGNAQ. Because the mutations occur in 93.4% of the tumours, it seems to be an early event in the development of a melanoma, and our study demonstrates that mutations inGNAQandGNA11do not contribute to the patients' prognosis. Moreover, we conclude thatGNA11mutations are not more harmful thanGNAQmutations in uveal melanoma patients. All mutations were localised either in codon 209 (exon 5) for bothGNAQandGNA11or codon 183 (exon 4) forGNA11only. Surprisingly, one tumour harboured a double mutation inGNA11codons 209 and 214. The reported heterozygous non-synonymous variant in codon 214 results in arginine to methionine transition. A germline variant was excluded by sequencing normal retinal tissue. Using thein silicotool PolyPhen-2, both these transitions seem to be damaging on the structure and function of the protein. The tumour with the double mutation had no chromosomal alterations, and this patient has not developed any metastases at a follow-up time of 154.1 months. To our knowledge, this is the first reported double mutation inGNA11exon 5 in uveal melanoma. Recently, the Galphagenes have been investigated in metastatic lesions, showing no difference in mutation frequency between rapidly progressive and slowly progressive lesions (Abdel-RahmanNone, 2012). This is in line with our findings that patient outcome is not influenced by the presence of mutations inGNAQorGNA11. GNAQandGNA11are involved in the MAPK pathway, and mutations in these genes lead to downstream oncogenic signalling (Van RaamsdonkNone, 2009a,2010). Currently, new therapeutic strategies that inhibit the downstream signalling molecules are being investigated. MEK is a potential target in the MAPK pathway, and the effects of several MEK inhibitors on uveal melanoma cell lines with Galphamutations have been described (MitsiadesNone, 2011;von EuwNone, 2012). In a preclinical study, Galpha-mutant uveal melanoma cells were mildly sensitive to the MEK inhibitor AZD6244, and either moderately or highly sensitive to the MEK inhibitor TAK733. Dual-pathway inhibition of the MAPK and the PI3K/AKT pathway with MEK inhibitor GSK1120212 and PI3K inhibitor GSK2126458 resulted in induction of apoptosis in Galpha-mutant uveal melanoma cells (KhaliliNone, 2012). In conclusion, we confirm that mutations inGNAQandGNA11are, in equal matter, not associated with patient outcome. Also the newly found variant with a double mutation does not affect patient survival. Because the mutations occur in the majority of the tumours, and slowly growing as well as fast growing metastases, targeting of the downstream pathway seems promising. Even though there is no relation with development of metastatic disease, the new therapeutic options would be ideal in stabilising the disease process. At this moment, clinical studies are ongoing and the results have not yet been evaluated.
