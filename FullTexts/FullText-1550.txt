In plants, gibberellins (GAs) play crucial roles in shoot elongation and reproductive development, including stem elongation, leaf expansion, seed germination, and flowering. Most genes involved in the biosynthesis and catabolism pathways of GAs have been identified, especially in the model plant speciesArabidopsis thalianaand rice (Oryza sativa) (Hedden and Phillips, 2000;OlszewskiNone., 2002;Sun and Gubler, 2004). Also, many mutants with altered GA metabolism or signalling pathways have been studied inA. thaliana(Koornneef and van der Veen, 1980; Vabanovaet al., 2007;AriizumiNone., 2008) and rice (Ueguchi-TanakaNone., 2000;IkedaNone., 2001;SasakiNone., 2003;SakamotoNone., 2004). These GA-related mutants have been used to identify the key components in GA metabolism and signalling pathways, and some of them have successfully contributed to the green revolution to confer useful agronomic traits in cereals (PengNone., 1999;SasakiNone., 2002;SpielmeyerNone., 2002). Previous studies have shown that GAs are biosynthesized from geranylgeranyl diphosphate, and three types of enzymes, plastid-localized terpene cyclases, membrane-bound cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s), and soluble 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases (2ODDs), are responsible for the conversion of geranylgeranyl diphosphate into bioactive GAs, such as GA1and GA4(ZhuNone., 2006). The bioactive GA1and GA4, and their immediate precursors GA20and GA9, respectively, are further deactivated by GA 2-oxidases (GA2oxs) (ThomasNone., 1999;Yamaguchi and Kamiya, 2000;OlszewskiNone., 2002). InArabidopsis, AtGA2ox7 and AtGA2ox8 also catalyse the 2-oxidation of C20-GAs (SchomburgNone., 2003;Lee and Zeevaart, 2005). To date, a few loss-of-function mutants of the GA2ox gene family members have been recognized (Hedden and Phillips, 2000;SakamotoNone., 2004). In pea (Pisum sativum), the loss-of-function mutation in thePsGA2ox1gene causes a tall phenotype (LesterNone., 1999). In rice, the recessive tall rice mutantelongated uppermost internode(eui) (Rutger and Carnahan, 1981), which demonstrates a rapid and enhanced elongation of internodes, has been used to improve the heading performance of male strerile cultivars genetically (Shen and He, 1989;He and Shen, 1991,1994;YangNone., 2002). Recently, theEUIgene was isolated. Map-based cloning reveals thatEUIencodes a previously uncharacterized P450, CYP714D1, that acts as a GA-deactivating enzyme through 16alpha, 17-epoxidation of 13-hydroxylated GAs (ZhuNone., 2006). In rice, 16alpha, 17-(OH)2-GA4has been identified as a metabolite of GA4exogenously applied to seedlings (KobayashiNone., 1993), and as an aglycone of a GA glucoside in anthers (HasegawaNone., 1994). The 16alpha, 17-(OH)2-GAs were also found in other plant species, such asPisum sativumfruits (SantesNone., 1995),Lupinus albusseeds (GaskinNone., 1992), developingMalus domesticaseeds (HeddenNone., 1993),Cibotiumglaucumsporophytes (YamaneNone., 1988),Prunus aviumseedlings (BlakeNone., 2000), andPopulus trichocarpacapsules (PearceNone., 2002). However, whether these 16alpha, 17-(OH)2-GAs are produced via 16alpha, 17-epoxy GAs by EUI-related enzymes is still unclear in these plant species, especially in the model woody plantPopulus trichocarpa. In this work, the riceOsCYP714D1gene was constitutively expressed in aspen. It was found that ectopic expression ofOsCYP714D1in transgenic aspen positively regulated the biosynthesis of GAs, leading to promotion of the growth rate and biomass production. Moreover, transcription of most homologousPtCYP714genes was suppressed in the fast-growing transgenic lines. These findings will aid in future attempts to engineer the growth trait by manipulating biosynthesis of GAs in aspen, possibly as well as in other plants. The plant vector was generously provided by Professor Zuhua He (Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, CAS, China). The 1.9kb riceOsCYP714D1(OsEui) full-length cDNA, driven by theCauliflower mosaic virus(CaMV) 35S promoter and terminated by the NOS terminator, was inserted into theEcoRI andHindIII sites in pCAMBIA1301 (http://www.cambia.org) (ZhuNone., 2006). The construct was introduced into theAgrobacterium tumefaciensstrain EHA105 using the freeze-thaw method (WiseNone., 2006) for aspen transformation. In this study, the Yinzhong (P. alba*P. berolinensis) hybrid clone, which is commercially grown in the north part of China, was used for plant transformation. Generally,in vitrogrown plants were subcultured monthly by aseptically transferring shoot apices to fresh MS medium (Murashige and Skoog, 1962) supplemented with 0.1mg l-1naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA). Plantlets were grown in the tissue culture room with cool white fluorescent light (~200 mumol m-2s-1) under short day conditions (12h light/12h dark). The temperature was kept at 21-25 degrees C in the day time and at 15-18 degrees C at night. TheOsCYP714D1gene was transformed into the hybrid aspen as described previously (WangNone., 2011). Independently regenerated transgenic lines were propagated, potted, and grown in the greenhouse. For PCR analyses, genomic DNA was isolated from fresh leaves (~500mg for each sample) of 1-month-old tissue cultured wild-type (WT) and regenerated transgenic lines as described previously (Kanget al., 2010). Gene-specific primers (forward, 5'-CGCGGGCTTGCTTTGGGAGTGA-3'; and reverse, 5'-CCGCC GCAGACCTCGAGCACCT-3') and GC buffer (TaKaRa, Japan) were used to amplify a 463bp PCR product. For RT-PCR analyses, total RNA was isolated from shoots of 1-month-old tissue cultured WT and transgenic plants with the RNAiso Reagent (TaKaRa, Japan). After treatment with DNase I (Promega), 2 mug of total RNA was subjected to reverse transcription using the reverse transcriptase ReverTra Ace (TOYOBO, Japan) at 42 degrees C for 1h. The resultant cDNA was then used for RT-PCR with gene-specific primers. GC buffer and gene-specific primers were the same as used for PCR analysis (38 cycles). The elongation factor genePtEF1betawas employed as an internal control (25 cycles). The primers forPtEF1betaare: forward 5'-GACAAGAAGGCAGCGGAGGAGAG-3' and reverse 5'-CAA TGAGGGAATCCACTGACACAAG-3'. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was performed with the RotorGene 3000 system (Corbett Research) using the SYBR Green Realtime PCR Master Mix (TOYOBO, Japan) to monitor double-stranded DNA products. Data analysis was performed with Rotor-Gene software version 6.0, and relative amounts of mRNA were calculated based on the comparative threshold cycle method. The relative expression of each target gene was normalized using the housekeeping genePtEF1beta, and the expression value of the WT was set to 1. The primers used in this research are shown inSupplementary Table S1available atJXBonline. Histochemical GUS staining was conducted as described previously (Gallagher, 1992). Briefly, leaf explants were incubated overnight at 37 degrees C in a reagent mix containing 2mM 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-d-glucuronide (X-Gluc), 0.1M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 0.5mM each of potassium ferri- and ferrocyanide, 10mM EDTA (pH 7.0), and 0.1% Triton X-100. After staining, the tissues were cleared of chlorophyll with 95% ethanol. For Southern blot analysis, 10 mug of genomic DNA isolated from the leaves of WT and transgenic plants was digested withEcoRI, electrophoresed on 0.8% agarose gels, and transferred onto Hybond N+nylon membranes with a Whatman Biometra(r)Vacuum-Blot System. The 463bp PCR product ofOsCYP714D1was used as a hybridization probe. Standard procedures for Southern blot analysis and probe labelling were conducted with a DIG DNA Labeling and Detection Kit1 (Roche, Germany) following the manufacturer's instructions. Rooted WT and transgenic plants were transplanted into soil and maintained in the greenhouse. Plants were watered every 2 d and fertilized with a complete nutrient solution once a week. After 2 weeks, healthy plants (at least eight individuals for each line) were marked at the base internode. This was used as a reference point for measuring the growth of plants. The height was counted from the top to the reference point every week for a period of 6 weeks. The number of leaves and internodes of 8-week-old plants were counted, with the first internode being defined as that below the first leaf of at least 1cm length in the apex. The average of internodes (10th, 11th, and 12th) with the upper leaves was used to measure the diameter of stems, and the length of internodes and petioles, respectively. For GA content analysis, the upper leaves of the 11th internode were sampled and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. For anatomical studies, the 11th internode was excised and immediately fixed in FAA solution. The 18th internode was excised and chilled on ice immediately for subsequent fibre length measurements. All of the remaining part after sampling was separated into shoot (including stem and leaves) and root fractions, and used for determination of the fresh weight, and then, after drying at 65 degrees C for 5 d, for dry weight determination. Following conventional chemical fixation in FAA and dehydration in an ethanol series, samples (the 11th internode of each line) were embedded in paraffin. Transverse or longitudinal sections of 8 mum thickness were cut on a microtome (Leica, Germany). The paraffin-embedded sections were dried for 2 d at 42 degrees C and then dewaxed and re-hydrated as follows. The sections were immersed in dimethylbenzene for 5-10min and this was repeated once with fresh dimethylbenzene. Then, the sections were immersed in 50% dimethylbenzene (diluted in absolute ethyl alcohol) followed by a gradient of ethyl alcohol (100, 95, 85, and 70%) to re-hydrate. For all of the solutions, the immersion time was 5-10min. Following that, the sections were immediately dipped into 0.2% toluidine blue (0.2g of toluidine blue dissolved in 60ml of ethyl alcohol and 40ml of distilled water) for 10 s and then washed in water twice (5-10 s each time). The dyed sections were used for microexamination. Images were captured under bright field using an ECLIPSE 80i microscope. Using the UTHSCSA Image Tool software, the radial width of the outer bark, phloem, cambium, and xylem, the thickness of the secondary cell wall in xylem and phloem fibre, and the length of outer bark cells were measured, and the numbers of xylem cells (for transverse sections) and outer bark cells (for longitudinal sections) were counted. For fibre length measurements, trimmed pieces of outer xylem from the 18th internode of 2-month-old plants grown in the greenhouse were prepared. The samples were macerated in a boiling solution of 10% hydrogen peroxide and 50% glacial acetic acid for 4-6h, rinsed with distilled water three times, neutralized with sodium carbonate, and washed again in water. Finally, the fibres were separated from each other in water, and measured under an ECLIPSE 80i microscope. The lengths of at least 300 fibres per sample were measured. Sampled leaves were homogenized in liquid nitrogen using a mortar and pestle, and then lyophilized. Samples of 2g dry weight (DW) were purified and finally analysed at Wuhan University (China) as described previously (ChenNone., 2011). [2H2]GA1(1ng g-1), [2H2]GA4(10ng g-1), [2H2]GA9(10ng g-1), [2H2]GA12(30ng g-1), [2H2]GA53(50ng g-1), and [2H5]indole acetic acid (IAA; 10ng g-1) were added to plant samples as internal standards and the recovery was 87.1-108.6%. Except for GA1, which was detected at low concentration in three transgenic lines L4, L13, and L32, but not detected in the WT and line L23, significant differences in IAA, GA12, GA9, GA4, and GA53between transgenic plants and the WT were analysed using Student'st-test atP less than 0.05. Values are means +/-SD of three biological replicates of three individual plants from the WT or the same transgenic line. For statistical analyses, the Student'st-test was used to generate everyP-value. The tests were one-tailed. The data were normalized and all samples were normally distributed with homogeneity of variance. A construct containing the open reading frame ofOsCYP714D1(Fig. 1A) was introduced into the genome of the Yinzhong (P. alba*P. berolinensis) hybrid clone byAgrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. More than 20 independently regenerated lines were obtained and seven transgenic lines (L4, L6, L13, L23, L29, L32, and L33) were identified by PCR analyses. The expected 463bp band was detected in all the checked transgenic lines (Fig. 1B). RT-PCR and GUS staining analyses further confirmed the expression ofOsCYP714D1andGusin transgenic plants (Fig. 1C,D). Transgenic plants were subsequently transferred to pots and grown in the greenhouse for further experiments. Structure of the plant expression vector and confirmation of transgenic plants.

(C) RT-PCR confirmation ofOsCYP714D1transcripts in the wild type (WT) and different lines (L4-L33). Total RNA was isolated from 1-month-old WT and different transgenic lines (L1-L16). ThePtEF1betagene was used as an internal control. RT-PCR was performed withOsCYP714D1-specific primers orPtEF1beta-specific primers. (D) Histochemical GUS staining of WT and transgenic (L4-L33) leaves of Yinzhong aspen. (This figure is available in colour atJXBonline.) Previous studies have shown that whenOsCYP714D1was constitutively expressed in rice (driven by the 35S promoter), transgenic rice showed severe dwarfism and failed to set grain (ZhuNone., 2006). To understand the functions ofOsCYP714D1in poplar development, transgenic poplar plants constitutively expressingOsCYP714D1were generated. Among the seven independently derived and PCR-confirmed transgenic lines (Fig. 1B), four lines with differentOsCYP714D1expression levels (lines L4, L13, L23, and L32) were chosen for the following studies (Fig. 1C). After 8 weeks growth in the greenhouse, significant growth phenotype differences were observed between WT and transgenic plants (Fig. 2A-D). The growth of three transgenic lines (L4, L13, and L32), which showed significant expression ofOsCYP714D1, was faster than that of the WT in terms of plant height (Fig. 3A), leaf number (Fig. 3B), stem diameter (Fig. 3C), stem internode and leaf petiole length (Fig. 3D), and shoot fresh and dry weights (Fig. 3E,F), whereas little difference was found between the WT and transgenic line L23, which showed almost undetectable expression ofOsCYP714D1(Figs 2,3). To confirm that theOsCYP714D1gene was inserted into the aspen genome, Southern blot analyses were performed. Most transgenic plants had 1-2 copies of the transgene (Fig. 2E). Phenotypes and Southern blot analyses of 2-month-old wild-type and transgenic plants constitutively expressingOsCYP714D1. WT, wild type; L23, a negative control transgenic line with very low expression ofOsCYP714D1; L4, L13, and L32, three independent transgenic lines with high expression ofOsCYP714D1.

(A) Cumulative shoot elongation of various transgenicOsCYP714D1-expressing lines. (B-D) Leaf number, stem diameter, internode and petiole length, and fresh and dry weight comparison of wild-type and transgenic lines. After generation from tissue culture and potting, plants were grown in the greenhouse for 6 weeks (at time zero). The 10th, 11th, and 12th internodes and petioles counting from the apex were used. Fresh weights were measured immediately after harvest. For dry weight analyses, the materials were dried out at 65 degrees C for 5 d. Shoot weights include stems and leaves only. WT, wild-type control; L23, negative control; L4, L13, L32, threeOsCYP714D1transgenic lines. Values are means +/-SD of 10 individual plants with three independent biological replicates. * indicates significant differences in comparison with the WT atP less than 0.05 (Student'st-test). A detailed anatomical study of the three transgenic lines L4, L13, and L32 was performed. Compared with the WT control, the transgenic lines showed not only enhanced radial width of the stem and xylem, but also thickened phloem fibre cell walls and an elongated longitudinal length of the outer bark cells (Supplementary Fig S1atJXBonline). The observed differences were further confirmed by measurements by microscopy (Fig. 4). The stem diameter growth was primarily due to the widened xylem since there was no obvious difference between the WT control and transgenic lines in the cambium zone, phloem, and outer bark (Fig. 4A). Moreover, the widened xylem was mainly caused by increased xylem cell number (Fig. 4B). The difference in growth in height in the transgenic plants, compared with the WT control, was primarily caused by the increased lengths of the xylem fibre cells (Fig. 4C) and the collenchyma and parenchyma cells (Fig. 4E). In contrast to the changes in the xylem, the main difference in the phloem of the transgenic plants when compared with the WT control was the thickened phloem fibre cell walls (Fig. 4D). Effects ofOsCYP714D1expression on stem radial growth, xylem cell number, fibre cell wall thickness, and outer bark cell and xylem fibre cell length of 2-month-old wild-type (WT) andOsCYP714D1transgenic plants (lines L4 and L32). (A-E) Average values with standard deviations for radial width (A), xylem cell number (B), xylem fibre length (C), cell wall thickness of xylem fibres (Xf) and phloem fibres (Pf) (D), and cell length of outer bark (E). Values shown are means +/-SD of at least 10 tissues (for radial width and xylem cell number) or 30 cells (for cell wall thickness, cell length of outer bark) or 300 cells (for xylem fibre length) of WT and transgenic plants (L4 and L32).

GA content was determined in the leaves of actively growing WT and transgenic plants. Transgenic plants showed high levels of the early 13-hydroxylated C19GAs (GA53and GA1) and the non-13-hydroxylated C19GAs (GA12, GA9, and GA4). The levels of the biologically active GA4in transgenic lines L4, L13, and L32 were pronouncedly higher than in the control plants. The level of GA1was relatively low in transgenic lines, but was undetectable in the control plants (Fig. 5). Endogenous GA levels in the leaves of 2-month-old wild-type andOsCYP714D1transgenic plants. WT, wild type; L23, a negative control transgenic line with very low expression ofOsCYP714D1; L4, L13, and L32, three independent transgenic lines with high expression ofOsCYP714D1. Values are means +/-SD of three biological replicates of three individual plants from the WT or the same transgenic line. ND, not detected. * indicates significant differences in comparison with the WT atP less than 0.05 (Student'st-test). The expression of most genes involved in GA biosynthesis and catabolism pathways was examined by quantitative real-time PCR. Four GA biosynthesis genes (three GA20oxs,PtGA20ox1,PtGA20ox3,PtGA20ox4; and one GA3ox,PtGA3ox1), two GA2ox GA catabolism genes (PtGA2ox1andPtGA2ox2), one GA receptor gene (PtGID1), and two GA suppressor genes (PtRGL1-1andPtGAI2) involved in GA signalling were analysed (Fig. 6). For the genes involved in GA synthesis,PtGA20ox3andPtGA3ox1were down-regulated in transgenic lines L4, L13, and L32 compared with the controls. However, thePtGA20ox4gene was slightly up-regulated in all four transgenic lines. No distinct change was observed in the expression ofPtGA20ox1. For the genes involved in GA catabolism,PtGA2ox2was slightly down-regulated in transgenic lines L4, L13, and L32, in contrast to the negative control L23 in which the gene was up-regulated compared with the wild type. PtGA2ox1showed no obvious changes between the WT and transgenic plants, except for L32, in which the expression ofPtGA2ox1was strongly increased. As a key GA receptor gene,PtGID1expression was increased in L4 and L32 but not in L13. As for the two suppressor genes, down-regulated expression was observed in L4 and L13 forPtRGL1-1, but only in L13 forPtGAI2. Quantitative real-time PCR analyses of GA pathway genes in wild-type andOsCYP714D1transgenic plants. WT, wild type; L23, a negative control transgenic line with very low expression ofOsCYP714D1; L4, L13, and L32, three independent transgenic lines with high expression ofOsCYP714D1. Total RNA was extracted from leaves of 2-month-old WT and transgenic plants grown in the greenhouse, and reverse transcribed to cDNA for quantitative PCR amplification. Transcript levels were normalized using the housekeeping genePtEF1beta, and the expression value ofPtEF1betawas set to 1. Error bars represent the SD (n=3). PtGA20ox1,PtGA20ox3,andPtGA20ox4, PtGA 20-oxidase genes;PtGA3ox1, PtGA 3-oxidase gene;PtGA2ox1andPtGA2ox2, PtGA 2-oxidase genes;PtGID1, a soluble GA receptor gene;PtRGL1-1(a homologue of theArabidopsis RGLgene) andPtGAI2(a homologue of theArabidopsis GAIgene), putative DELLA proteins. The GenBank accession numbers are as follows:PtGA20ox1(AJ001326.2),PtGA20ox3(XM_002306627.1),PtGA20ox4(XM_002306626.1),PtGA2ox1(AY392094.1),PtGA3ox1(AY433958),PtGA2ox2(BU877509);PtGID1(XM_002328371.1),PtRGL1-1(eugene3.00040654), andPtGAI2(eugene3.00101036). To gain insight into the gene expression changes that might be associated with the increased GA accumulation, altered GA pathway gene expression, and the dramatically increased growth of transgenic plants, the expression levels of the native homologous genes ofOsCYP714D1inPopuluswere analysed. The database ofP. thichocarpaJamboree Gene Models athttp://genome.jgi-psf.org/pages/blast.jsf?db=Poptr1_1was blasted with the protein sequence of OsCYP714D1. About 100 hits were found, and the six with the highest homology were named PtCYP714A3, PtCYP714E2, PtCYP714E4, PtCYP714E5, PtCYP714E6, and PtCYP714F1 according to The P450 Homepage (http://drnelson.uthsc.edu) (Supplementary Fig. S2atJXBonline). Since the location of PtCYP714E5 and PtCYP714E6 is adjacent and their transcripts share 99% homology, PtCYP714E6 is regarded as a duplicate of PtCYP714E5. Therefore,PtCYP714A3,PtCYP714E2,PtCYP714E4,PtCYP714E5, andPtCYP714F1were selected for further analyses. It was observed that the transcriptions of most homologousPtCYP714genes were down-regulated in these transgenic lines (Fig. 7). Quantitative real-time PCR analyses ofOsCYP714D1homologues in wild-type andOsCYP714D1transgenic plants. WT, wild type; L23, a negative control transgenic line with very low expression ofOsCYP714D1; L4, L13, and L32, three independent transgenic lines with high expression ofOsCYP714D1. Total RNA was extracted from leaves of 2-month-old WT and transgenic plants grown in the greenhouse, and reverse transcribed to cDNA for quantitative PCR amplification. Transcript levels were normalized using the housekeeping genePtEF1beta, and the expression value ofPtEF1betawas set to 1. Error bars represent the SD (n=3). The GenBank accession numbers and gene models for the poplarOsCYP714D1homologue genes are as follows:PtCYP714A3(gw1.125.153.1),PtCYP714E2(gw1.40.215.1),PtCYP714E4(fgenesh4_pm.C_LG_XIII 00485),PtCYP714E5(gw1.VIII.1518.1), andPtCYP714F1(fgenesh4_ pg.C_LG_X001058). As a large group of tetracyclic diterpenes, GAs can be deactivated by conjugation (Schneider and Schliemann, 1994), epoxidation (ZhuNone., 2006), methylation (VarbanovaNone., 2007), and 2-oxidation. Map-based cloning has revealed that theEUIgene encodes a previously uncharacterized P450, CYP714D1, which catalyses 16alpha, 17-epoxidation of non-13-hydroxylated GAs in rice. At the heading stage, theeuimutant exhibited an extremely elongated uppermost internode and accumulated extremely high levels of bioactive GAs in the uppermost internode. In contrast, transgenic rice overexpressingOsCYP714D1exhibited a severely dwarfed phenotype (ZhuNone., 2006). Unlike the transgenic rice, transgenic aspen constitutively expressingOsCYP714D1showed an extremely fast growing phenotype (Figs 2,3). Modification of GA biosynthesis has been successfully applied to crop breeding (SakamotoNone., 2003). GA20ox has been well established as a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of the plant hormone GA, and in the regulation of GA-controlled plant growth (Hedden and Kamiya, 1997). GA20ox-overexpressing plants showed an improved growth rate and biomass, and produced high levels of the 13-hydroxylated C19GAs (GA20, GA1, and GA8) and the non-13-hydroxylated C19GAs (GA9, GA4, and GA34) in both internodes and leaves (ErikssonNone., 2000). Overexpression ofPtGID1, a GA receptor gene, in transgenic poplars also led to rapid growth, and increased elongation and xylogenesis (Mauriat and Moritz, 2009). Since OsCYP714D1 is involved in the deactivation of GAs (GA4, GA9, and GA12) in rice (ZhuNone., 2006), it was thus speculated that the fast growing phenotypes ofOsCYP714D1transgenic plants could also be attributed to the increased GA production. To this end, the GA contents in both WT andOsCYP714D1transgenic lines were measured. Similarly, compared with the WT control,OsCYP714D1transgenic plants accumulated high levels of the early 13-hydroxylated GAs (GA53and GA1) and the non-13-hydroxylated GAs (GA12, GA9, and GA4) (Fig. 5). To clarify the possible reasons for the increased GA accumulation inOsCYP714D1-overexpressing plants, the transcripts of GA pathway genes were investigated (Fig. 6). Complex variations in expression were observed among these genes. Two GA oxidase genes (GA20ox3andGA3ox1) involved in GA biosynthesis were down-regulated. This could be a consequence of feedback down-regulation by the increased GA accumulation inOsCYP714D1-overexpressing plants. On the other hand, the expression of another GA20ox gene (GA20ox4) was increased in all the transgenic plants, including the negative control line L23, which implies that althoughGA20ox4might have a function or regulation mechanism different fromGA20ox3, it is not the key factor that increases GA accumulation in transgenic plants. Similarly, different changes in expression were observed withGA2ox1andGA2ox2, two GA2ox genes involved in GA catabolism (BusovNone., 2003). The slight down-regulation ofGA2ox2inOsCYP714D1-overexpressing lines might be caused by the feedback ofOsCYP714D1. No significant difference inGA2ox1expression was observed between the WT and the transgenic plants, except for L32, in which the expression ofGA2ox1was significantly enhanced. This result might be attributed to the different insertion sites and copy numbers of the exogenous gene among the different transgenic lines. Similar results were also observed in the other analysed genes such asGID1andGAI2. The soluble GA receptor (GID1) and DELLA proteins are the key mediators of GA response pathways. DELLA proteins act as negative regulators and are degraded in response to GA treatment (Ueguchi-TanakaNone., 2007). The expression ofPtGID1and two putative DELLA protein genes,PtGRL1-1andPtGAI2, was also detected. The increased GA accumulation up-regulated the expression ofPtGID1in transgenic lines L4 and L32, and, at the same time, down-regulated the expression ofPtRGL1-1in L4 and L13, as well as ofPtGAI2in L13. Although the expression levels of most GA pathway genes changed differently in the WT and transgenic plants, it seems that the differences were more likely to be the consequence but not the cause of the increased GA production in theOsCYP714D1-overexpressing plants. InP. deltoideshybrids and otherPopulusspecies, different GA members of both the early 13-hydroxylation and non-early 3- or 13-hydroxylation pathways of GA biosynthesis have been detected (BateNone., 1988;RoodNone., 1988;Zanewich and Rood, 1994;ErikssonNone., 2000;PearceNone., 2002). Therefore, different GA metabolites and different predominant biosynthesis pathways may exist in differentPopulusspecies. The unexpected fast growing phenotype and high levels of GA accumulation could be caused by the different function of OsCYP714D1 in aspen. OsCYP714D1 may use different substrate(s) in aspen which lead to a higher GA content. Indeed, transgenic plants overexpressing theArabidopsis Euigene (AtCYP714A1andAtCYP714A2) also showed different phenotypes from plants overexpressingOsCYP714D1when treated with exogenous GAs (ZhangNone., 2011). In addition, the CYP714 proteins in aspen share very high homology with OsCYP714D1 and AtCYP714s (Supplementary Fig. S2atJXBonline). Therefore, one of the other possibilities is that constitutive expression ofOsCYP714D1suppressed the expression ofPtCYP714genes in the transgenic aspen. The down-regulated expression of mostPtCYP714genes in transgenic plants seems to support this hypothesis (Fig. 7). The down-regulated expression of putative orthologousPopulus CYP714genes may also be a consequence of GA production. Further work on the functional characterization of these CYP714 family members in aspen will help to elucidate whether GA 16alpha, 17-epoxidation is a common GA deactivation reaction in the GA metabolism pathway in woody plant species. It has been well documented that GAs are required for xylem fibre cell differentiation (Wareing, 1958;Digby and Wareing, 1966). They profoundly affect the development of secondary xylem fibres as well as both longitudinal and radial growth in hardwood species (Little and Pharis, 1995;RidouttNone., 1996) and conifers (WangNone., 1995). In the present experiments, overexpression ofOsCYP714D1in transgenic poplars increased GA contents, and, as a result, increased xylem cell number, and xylem fibre and cortex cell length in the stems. In addition, GA and IAA combination, not GA alone, could affect primary phloem fibre differentiation, including the thickness of phloem fibre cells inColeus blumei(Aloni, 1979). It has also been suggested that a cross-talk between GA and auxin (IAA) exists during the growth and development of poplars (BjorklundNone., 2007;GouNone., 2010;MauriatNone., 2011). Thus, to clarify the reason for the phloem fibre cell wall thickness in transgenic poplars (Supplementary Fig. S1G-IatJXBonline), the endogenous IAA content was measured (Supplementary Fig. S3). As expected, the IAA content increased distinctly in the transgenic plants compared with the WT control. This might be attributed to the increased auxin polar transportation in transgenic plants (BjorklundNone., 2007). Taken together, constitutive expression of theOsCYP714D1gene increased GA and IAA production, and consequently promoted the growth of transgenic plants. The substantially increased growth and biomass reported here provide a promising strategy for increasing wood production in plants. Supplementary data are available atJXBonline. Figure S1.
