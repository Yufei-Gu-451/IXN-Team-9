Serovars of the Gram-negative bacteriumSalmonella entericaare usually associated with food-borne diarrheal illness in high-income countries. Such gastrointestinal disease is normally self-limiting and rarely life-threatening. Perhaps surprisingly,Salmonellahas not been identified as a principal etiological agent of diarrhea in developing countries. NoneNevertheless,Salmonellaeare responsible for a huge global disease burden through two forms of invasive illness: enteric fever and invasive nontyphoidalSalmonella(iNTS) disease. Enteric fever is principally caused bySalmonella entericaserovar Typhi (S. Typhi), for which the disease is also called typhoid fever, andS. Paratyphi A. Disease due to both serovars is a major problem in South and South-East Asia (Fig. 1A). S. Typhi is the leading pathogen isolated from blood cultures in South Asia,Nonethough in some areas enteric fever caused byS. Paratyphi A is more common. NoneThe annual global burden of disease due to typhoid fever was estimated at 21.7 million cases in 2000 with a case-fatality rate of 1% resulting in 217 000 deaths. NonePre-school and school-aged children are the most affected age groups. None-NoneThe global burden of disease attributable toS. Paratyphi A in 2000 was 5.4 million cases. NoneFigure 1. Geographical distribution of A. enteric fever and B. invasive nontyphoidalSalmonella(iNTS) disease indicating countries with high ( greater than 100 cases/100,000 population/year) and medium (10-100 cases/100,000 population/year) disease burden. Based on data from refs. 2-4In contrast, iNTS disease is a neglected disease and is mainly a problem in sub-Saharan Africa (Fig. 1B). Published global burden of disease estimates are not currently available, though case fatality rates, at 20-25%,Noneare much higher than for enteric fever, with an overall annual mortality likely to be well in excess of 100,000 and not dissimilar from that of enteric fever. In sub-Saharan African countries, nontyphoidalSalmonellae(NTS) are either the leading or next most common pathogenic blood culture isolate after pneumococcus,Nonefor which vaccines are available and are being implemented in the region. The two main serovars responsible for iNTS disease are Typhimurium and Enteritidis and the two groups most affected by iNTS disease are children under two years and HIV-infected individuals. Fever surveillance across 12 sites in sub-Saharan Africa during the RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine phase 3 trials gave an incidence of iNTS disease in children under two years of around 500/100 000 children/year. NoneIt is not clear why invasiveSalmonelladisease is a problem in the developing world and not in high-income countries, particularly with respect to iNTS disease. This could be due to differences in transmission, host immunity or the bacteria themselves. NoneMulti-locus sequencing typing (MLST) has been used to trace the evolutionary history ofS. Typhi. This revealed the expansion of haplotype H58 in Asia and Africa associated with the acquisition of resistance to fluoroquinolones over the past 20 y. NoneWhole genome studies ofSalmonellaisolates from Africa have identified new clades associated with iNTS disease, in particular, theS. Typhimurium ST313 pathovar. None,NoneS. Typhimurium ST313 is characterized by genome degradation and pseudogene formation, similar to that found inS. Typhi, suggesting that it may be passing through an evolutionary bottleneck. NoneThe genomic differences present in the ST313 clade, compared with NTS strains in developed countries, could underlie alternative pathways of transmission which for ST313 appear to be primarily human-to-human, rather than zoonotic or through contaminated food products, as is common in industrialised nations. None,NoneThe emergence of the two known clades of ST313 has been traced back to independent origins in Malawi and DRC around 50 y ago and their transmission through sub-Saharan Africa has been linked to the occurrence of the HIV/AIDS pandemic in Africa. NoneThere are two widely-available forms of vaccine licensed for use againstSalmonella,None,Noneyet neither have been implemented at country level. These are the live attenuated vaccine, Ty21a,None,Noneand Vi capsular polysaccharide (Vi CPS). NonePart of the reason for their lack of use in at-risk populations is their poor immunogenicity in young children. Neither are licensed for use in under two year olds. None,NoneThere are other associated problems with these vaccines (see section "Past and Current Vaccines") and both are targeted againstS. Typhi, with no vaccine currently available against the other three key invasive serovars ofSalmonella enterica, Paratyphi A, Typhimurium and Enteritidis. Although invasive forms ofSalmonelladisease are amenable to antibiotics, increasing frequencies of multi-drug resistance among invasive isolates threaten the effectiveness of such treatment. None,NoneIn Malawi, around 90% of iNTS isolates are multi-drug resistant. NoneA key problem with the effective management of invasiveSalmonelladisease, particularly in Africa, is the lack of appropriate diagnostic facilities. Currently, these infections can only be detected by microbiological culture, and facilities for this are rare in developing countries, particularly in Africa. The Widal test, based on the detection of antibodies to the O- and H-antigens ofS. Typhi by agglutination with patient serum, has been used in the past for diagnosis of typhoid fever. However, the sensitivity and specificity of this test is low, particularly in endemic areas where prior exposure toS. Typhi is common. NoneClinical diagnosis is difficult and for iNTS disease is simply not possible since there are no signs and symptoms that distinguish it from a number of other common infections. Fever is often the only presenting feature for iNTS disease resulting in confusion with malaria with which iNTS is well known to be associated. NoneiNTS disease can also result in the same clinical presentation as severe pneumonia,Nonethe currently recommended antibiotic treatment for which is often ineffective against iNTS. Even where blood culture facilities are available and a definitive diagnosis is possible, the clinical demise of individuals with iNTS disease is often rapid, with around half of children who die during their admission succumbing before the blood culture results are available. This often fatal condition is emphasized by the fact that the 20-25% case fatality rate comes from studies at sites where blood culture facilities are available. Another downside to these diagnostic problems is their contribution to the continuing poor awareness of invasiveSalmonellainfections, particularly iNTS disease, as a significant global disease burden. In short, new vaccines againstSalmonellahave the potential to make an enormous impact on global health. SinceSalmonellaeare facultative intracellular pathogens, they are able to survive both extracellularly and within the intracellular niche in monocytes and macrophages. This presents a challenge to vaccine developers, since humoral immunity is key for dealing with extracellular bacteria, while cellular immunity, mediated by both CD4+and CD8+T cells,None,Noneis required to eliminate bacteria within the monocyte/macrophage. Animal studies show that both modalities of immunity are required for the efficient control and elimination ofSalmonella. Salmonellaehave a conserved set of genes that allow them to survive within macrophages and mutations in these genes lead to a loss of virulence. NoneMice with defects in the oxidative burst mechanismNone,Noneand mice lacking T cellsNoneare unable to properly controlSalmonellainfections. Passive transfer studies indicate an important role for antibodies in protection againstSalmonella. None,NoneAntibodies have a key role in facilitating uptake and killing ofSalmonellaby phagocytes and preventing spread of disease which occurs principally via the blood,Nonewhile T cells are required for the elimination of persistent infection within phagocytes. None,NoneStudies in individuals with primary immunodeficiencies support the importance of cell-mediated immunity for protection againstSalmonelladisease. Patients with chronic granulomatous disease caused by defects in the oxidative burst mechanism,None,Noneand those with deficiencies of T helper 1 cell activation, caused by deletions in the IL-12/23-IFNgamma cytokine axis,None-Noneare particularly susceptible toSalmonelladisease. The best evidence for the role of antibodies in protection againstSalmonelladisease in man comes from efficacy studies of the Vi CPS vaccine, since this vaccine induces antibodies and not T cells. The importance of antibodies against iNTS disease in man is indicated by recent field studies from sub-Saharan Africa which have shown that the age-related prevalence of iNTS disease declines as specific antibody is acquired. NoneAccompanying mechanistic laboratory studies have demonstrated that such antibodies have functional activity against the invasive disease-causing isolates, both through activation and deposition of complement on the bacterial membrane resulting in cell-free killingNoneand through opsonisation for efficient uptake and killing by phagocytic cells. NoneHowever, the time required for killing of extracellularSalmonellais sufficient for the bacteria to escape into the intracellular niche where they can no longer be targeted by antibody. NoneHence, the evidence from human studies also supports a role for both antibodies and cell-mediated immunity in protection against invasiveSalmonelladisease. The well-recognized clinical association between HIV infection and iNTS disease, particularly among individuals with CD4 counts below 200 cells/ul,Nonealso appears to provide clear support for the importance of cell mediated immunity in defense againstSalmonella. However, the effects of HIV infection on host immunity are widespread, and there is recent evidence to indicate that HIV also increases susceptibility to NTS through dysregulation of humoral immunityNoneand cytokine responses,Noneand disruption of the integrity of the gastrointestinal mucosa. NoneVaccine strategies that induce protective mucosal immunity to prevent NTS gastroenteritis and invasion from the gastrointestinal tract could be particularly beneficial. No such association has been found between HIV infection and typhoid fever. Intriguingly, a study from Tanzania found that HIV-infected individuals were less susceptible to typhoid fever than those without HIV infection. NoneThese findings suggest differences in the immune mechanisms responsible for protection against iNTS disease and typhoid fever. Antibodies mediating protection againstSalmonellanecessarily need to target moieties on the outer surface of the bacterium (Table 1). The Vi antigen, which forms a polysaccharide capsule aroundS. Typhi (hence Vi CPS) and alsoS. Paratyphi C andS. Dublin, O-antigen of lipopolysaccharide (somatic antigen) and flagellin (H-antigen), which forms the flagella ofSalmonella, are all highly immunogenic. Antisera against Vi, O- and H-antigens have long been used for the typing ofSalmonellaserovars according to the Kauffmann-White scheme. None,NoneAll have been proposed as vaccine candidates with Vi CPS currently in use as a vaccine against typhoid fever. aiNTS, invasive nontyphoidalSalmonella;bLAV, Live Attenuated Vaccine;cGMMA, Generalized Modules for Membrane Antigens;d+/- for 'Other' protein antigens indicates dependency on identity of antigen;e+/- for 'LAV' and 'GMMA' indicates dependency on choice of production strain and presence/expression levels of key antigens in production strain and target serovar. NoneBecause the key iNTS serovars, Typhimurium and Enteritidis, are not host restricted to man, much work has been possible on NTS disease in the mouse model of salmonellosis. Experimental O-antigen-based conjugate vaccines can induce protection against otherwise lethalSalmonellachallenge in mice. None,NonePassive transfer of monoclonal antibodies targeting O-antigen also protect against challenge,None,Noneand most bactericidal antibody following immunisation of animals with heat-killed invasive African ST313S. Typhimurium is directed against O-antigen. NoneIn man, antibodies against O-antigen are present in adults and children from an early age in both AfricanNoneand USNonepopulations and have bactericidal activity. However, high levels of antibodies against O-antigen in some HIV-infected African adults are associated with a lack of in vitro killing ofSalmonella. NoneWhile the in vivo significance of this finding is not clear, the implication is that antibody to O-antigen does not protect HIV-infected individuals from iNTS disease. Host restriction ofS. Typhi to man has resulted in less animal work in relation to the Vi antigen, though genetic manipulation of NTS strains to express ViNonecan help overcome this obstacle. Nevertheless, the bactericidal capacity of antibodies raised to Vi in rabbits and mice has been known for many years,Noneand there is an inverse relationship between incidence of typhoid fever and serum bactericidal titer againstS. Typhi. NoneThe strongest evidence for the importance of antibodies targeting Vi is the protective efficacy data for the Vi CPS vaccineNone-Noneand from Phase 3 studies with candidate Vi conjugate vaccine. None-NoneWhile surface polysaccharides, by nature, are T-independent type 2 antigens (Ti2 antigens), and require conjugation to carrier proteins to induce T-dependent antibody responses,None,NoneSalmonellaproteins are able to recruit T cell help without further manipulation. Flagellin is the onlySalmonellasurface typing antigen that is a protein and therefore has been investigated for its ability to generate protective immune responses. Both immunisation with flagellin aloneNone,None,Noneor as the carrier protein for an O-antigen glycoconjugate vaccineNone,Nonehas been shown to induce protection in mice. Flagellin is also the key ligand for toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) and through this interaction is involved in innate signaling to the immune system and can have immunomodulatory effects in mice. None-NonePotential problems with flagellin as a vaccine candidate are that in some serovars, notablyS. Typhimurium, but not the other three main invasive serovars, there can be phase variable expression, and, in addition, it is not constitutively expressed bySalmonelladuring infection. WhileSalmonellaO-antigens and flagellin are antigenically diverse and vary between serovars, some surface proteins are highly-conserved and thus have potential for use in broadly protective vaccines. Monoclonal antibodies raised againstSalmonellaouter membrane proteins protect against challenge following passive transfer,Noneindicating their potential utility in vaccines. Much attention has been given to the porins which constitute particularly abundant outer membrane proteins. Immunisation with OmpC and OmpF,Noneand OmpDNonehas been shown to protect mice in challenge studies. These are widely-conserved proteins, although OmpD is not expressed byS. Typhi. As they have multiple membrane-spanning domains, their production for use in vaccines is not straightforward. Protein arrays have enabled the screening of sera for antibodies targeting thousands ofSalmonellaproteins. This approach has recently been used to demonstrate a common immune signature shared by mice immunised with live attenuatedSalmonellaand African children convalescing following iNTS disease, and to identify other potential candidate antigens, including SseB. NoneThese protein arrays have enabled the discrimination of immune responses of Vietnamese patients with acute typhoid from healthy controlsNoneand Bangladeshi patients with typhoid from those who are febrile due to other causes. NoneAlthough the importance of T cell-mediated immunity for protection againstSalmonellais well-known, far less work has been performed in order to identify the relevant T cell antigens, compared with B cells antigens. Interestingly, a recent study has found that the important T cell antigens are likely to be surface-associated inSalmonella,Noneindicating that surface proteins may act as both B cell and T cell antigens. As well as understanding the modalities and targets of protective immunity forSalmonellavaccines, it is important to understand which serovars ofSalmonella entericaneed to be targeted by vaccines. A drawback of the currently-available vaccines is that they are all directed againstS. Typhi. As mentioned earlier,S. Paratyphi A causes enteric fever with the same geographic distribution asS. Typhi, and the diseases are clinically indistinguishable. NoneHence, for South and South-East Asia, a vaccine that can protect against both serovars would be more valuable than a vaccine that is restricted to one. In sub-Saharan Africa, the same is true forS. Typhimurium andS. Enteritidis, indicating the importance of a vaccine that can protect against both iNTS serovars for this region. With subunit vaccines based on antigens that are specific to single serovars or groups of serovars (e.g., Vi, the O-antigens and flagellin), broad coverage can be achieved by combining multiple subunits, as has been done for the multivalent pneumococcal and meningococcal conjugate vaccines. However, this has the disadvantage of increasing costs, especially when glycoconjugate technology is used. As the invasive forms ofSalmonelladisease are a major problem in some of the poorest countries, vaccine affordability is a key consideration. A further drawback to the use of serovar-specific antigens for vaccine development is the evolving epidemiology of invasiveSalmonelladisease. In the time it takes to develop a new vaccine (minimum ten years), the epidemiology may change considerably. There is evidence for this occurring already in Africa, whereS. Typhi has become an increasing problem in some areas. This appears to be partly driven by the spread ofS. Typhi H58 into Africa from AsiaNoneand has been a particular problem in urban slums with poor sanitation. None,NoneSurprisingly, in Blantyre, Malawi, where typhoid fever has previously been uncommon compared with iNTS disease, in the last yearS. Typhi has been isolated more frequently from the blood of patients admitted to hospital than nontyphoidal serovars. NoneOther nontyphoidal serovars are a problem in specific parts of sub-Saharan Africa, such as Dublin and Stanleyville in Mali,Noneand could take over from Typhimurium and Enteritidis as the major cause of iNTS disease. Nevertheless, O-antigen-based conjugate vaccines should offer cross-protection against other non-encapsulated serovars within the same serogroup. Hence, O:1,4,[5],12 (to give its full O-antigen designation)S. Typhimurium conjugates should protect against other O:4 group (formerly B group) serovars,Noneincluding Stanleyville (O:1,4,[5],12,27) and Paratyphi B (O:1,4,[5],12), since all express the dominant O:4 antigen. Likewise, O:1,9,12S. Enteritidis conjugates should protect against O:9 group (formerly D group) serovars, such as Dublin (also O:1,9,12) and potentially Typhi (O:9,12[Vi]), provided the O-specific antibodies gain access through the Vi capsule to their target antigen. In view of the potential for cross-protection within serogroups, it has been proposed that a multivalent vaccine composed of 5-6 conjugates could cover almost all invasiveSalmonelladisease. NoneAn alternative strategy for developing vaccines with broad coverage is to use protein antigens that are highly conserved among different serovars ofSalmonella. The increasing number of available whole genome sequences from different invasiveSalmonellafield isolates,None,None,Nonecombined with the reverse vaccinology approach,Nonecan facilitate the identification of such antigens. The first type of vaccine againstSalmonella, an inactivated whole cell vaccine, was in use for over 100 y (Fig. 2,Table 2). Like Ty21a and Vi CPS, the inactivated whole cell vaccine targetedS. Typhi and was never implemented at a country-wide level. It was introduced in 1896,Noneand used extensively by the BritishNoneand USNonemilitary resulting in a dramatic reduction in cases of typhoid fever and associated deaths. Of the threeSalmonellavaccines, the inactivated whole cell vaccine has been the most effective with a three year cumulative efficacy of 73%. NoneThe major drawback, and reason why this vaccine is no longer used,Noneis its high level of reactogenicityNone,Nonewhich, while previously tolerated by military personnel, is unacceptable for general use.

Ty21a and Vi CPS are fascinating for the immunologist and vaccinologist as they act through completely different, though still-to-be-properly-defined, mechanisms. Ty21a is a live attenuated vaccine that was developed through non-specific chemical mutagenesis. NoneThough derived from the Vi-expressingS. Typhi Ty2 strain, surprisingly Ty21a does not express the Vi antigen and so none of its effects can be attributed to an immune response to this antigen. In contrast, the Vi CPS vaccine consists of purified Vi polysaccharide, although a recent study has suggested that otherSalmonellacomponents may be present in the vaccine. NoneThere are reduced rates of seroconversion following immunization with Ty21a in young children compared with adults. NoneAs an enteric-coated capsule, it is licensed for use in adults and children over five years. Multiple doses (routinely three) are needed and there are issues with thermal stability emphasizing the importance of a robust cold-chain. Despite these drawbacks, Ty21a has a cumulative three-dose efficacy of 51%None,Noneand there is evidence that it can induce herd protection. NoneThe vaccine may also be amenable to increased thermal stability using a modified freeze-drying process. NoneAs a live attenuated vaccine, Ty21a has good potential to induce T cell immunity and cross-protection against non-Typhi serovars. Indeed, there is clinical evidence for some cross-protection againstS. Paratyphi BNoneand in vitro evidence for the induction of antibody-secreting cells with cross-reactivity againstS. Paratyphi A and B. None,NoneSuch studies suggest that Ty21a may be acting primarily through the humoral immune response that it elicits, rather than through cell-mediated immunity. Recent evidence suggests that much of the B cell response is directed against O:9 which would indicate potential utility for the vaccine against the principal iNTS serovar,S. Enteritidis. NoneS. Enteritidis, in common withS. Typhi, expresses O:9. Being a Ti2 antigen, the Vi CPS is unlikely to be immunogenic in infants and is only licensed for children over two years of age. Its effectiveness in children between two and five years is uncertain, since two cluster randomized-controlled trials in this age group, in KolkataNoneand Karachi,Nonegave differing results, with protective efficacy only demonstrated in the Kolkata study. The lack of T cell help in the immune response to pure polysaccharide vaccines classically results in a lack of immunoglobulin class-switching, affinity maturation through somatic hypermutation in germinal centers, in addition to a lack of immunogenicity in infants and young children. None,NoneFurther common findings are a lack of induction of immunological memory as well as limited duration of antibody response and hyporesponsiveness to subsequent vaccination. NoneIn this respect, it is perhaps surprising that Vi CPS has a similar three year efficacy against typhoid fever to that of Ty21a, at 55%,None,Nonedespite their different mechanisms of action. In contrast to Ty21a, the efficacy of Vi CPS is for a single vaccination dose, though Vi CPS has similar cold chain requirements. It is interesting to speculate what efficacy would result if both vaccines were given together, as their mechanisms of protection may well act in a complementary synergistic manner. As far as we are aware, no clinical trial has been conducted to investigate this. A further difference in the immune response elicited by Vi CPS and Ty21a is found in the profile of homing receptor expression in the circulating plasmablasts they induce. Those resulting from immunization with Vi CPS have a systemic homing profile with the large majority of cells expressing L-selectin, while plasmablasts after vaccination with Ty21a have very high expression of the mucosal homing receptor alpha4beta7,Nonesimilar to what occurs following natural infection. With the limitations of the two existingSalmonellavaccines, particularly their lack of effectiveness in young children, along with their lack of widespread uptake in endemic countries, theSalmonellacommunity and global health policy makers are keenly awaiting the arrival of new vaccines againstSalmonella(Table 3,4and5). This has been a long wait given that the first Phase 3 study of a Vi glycoconjugate vaccine was reported over 12 y ago. NoneThis study found 91% efficacy with a vaccine consisting of Vi conjugated to recombinantPseudomonas aeruginosaexoprotein A (Vi-rEPA) in Vietnamese children aged two to five years after 27 mo follow up, with 89% efficacy after 46 mo. NoneThe delay can most likely be attributed to the lack of a clear commercial incentive for developing vaccines againstSalmonella. NoneInvasiveSalmonellainfections are principally diseases of low-income countries. Nevertheless, in recent years there has been enhanced activity in the field of vaccine development againstSalmonella, particularly in the development of conjugate vaccines againstS. Typhi, with several different companies and institutions involved. These initiatives have partly been driven by the expanding network of vaccine manufacturers in the emerging economies, particularly India (BioMed, Shantha Biotechnics and Bharat Biotech International) and China (Lanzhou Institute of Biological Products). Several other manufacturers in the Developing Countries Vaccine Manufacturers Network,Nonesuch as the Finlay Institute, Biological E, Biofarma, Chengdu, SK Chemical and EuBiologics are also developing vaccines againstSalmonella. Impetus for the development ofSalmonellavaccines has also come from global health vaccine institutes, particularly the International Vaccine Institute (IVI)Nonein Seoul, South Korea, and Novartis Vaccines Institute for Global Health (NVGH)Nonein Siena, Italy, as well as key academic institutions, notably the National Institutes of Health, USA, and Center for Vaccine Development (CVD) at the University of Maryland, Baltimore, USA. NoneNotes: *development in combination with corresponding Vi-DT conjugate againstS.Typhi; development in combination with corresponding Vi-CRM197conjugate againstS.Typhi; development in combination with CVD 909an exhaustive list, particularly of all candidate vaccines in preclinical studies, is beyond the scope of this reviewSuch vaccines offer the prospect of inducing improved levels of protection over current vaccines and, importantly, providing protective immunity in children under two years of age where invasiveSalmonelladisease, particularly iNTS disease, is a particular problem. Therefore, these vaccines could be administered as part of national Expanded Programmes on Immunization (EPI), thus reducing delivery costs. Vaccines against typhoid and enteric fevers would likely be given at nine months,Noneprior to the peak in age-related incidence in the second year of life,Noneand vaccines against iNTS to young infants between two and four months of age, since peak incidence occurs around one year. None,NoneWhile the first new vaccines against typhoid fever have already been licensed for in-country use in India and China, vaccines against iNTS disease lag a long way behind, despite the comparable burden of disease they cause. Since both enteric fever and iNTS disease are health problems primarily in low-income countries, this is likely to be attributable to a general lack of appreciation and awareness of the problem of iNTS in the global health community. NoneGlycoconjugates are the most advanced of the new generation of vaccines againstSalmonellaand offer the advantages described above over pure polysaccharide vaccines such as Vi CPS. Salmonellaglycoconjugate vaccines have the potential to recruit T cell help to the production of antibodies against Vi and O-antigen surface polysaccharides through covalent linkage to protein carrier molecules, thereby effectively converting these polysaccharides from T-independent to T-dependent antigens. This approach had been successfully applied to other encapsulated bacteria, particularlyHemophilus influenzaeb, meningococcus and pneumococcus. AlthoughS. Typhi is the only encapsulated serovar among the fourSalmonellaserovars responsible for the majority of invasiveSalmonelladisease, evidence from animal studies supports the development of conjugate vaccines against the three other principal invasive serovars through conjugation of their lipopolysaccharide O-antigens (O:1,2,12, O:1,4,[5],12 and O:1,9,12, forS. Paratyphi A, Typhimurium and Enteritidis, respectively)Noneto suitable carrier proteins. NoneThe glycoconjugate strategy for newSalmonellavaccines is principally an antibody approach. The majority ofSalmonellaconjugate vaccines employ the familiar carrier proteins, tetanus toxoid (TT), diphtheria toxoid (DT) and the nontoxic recombinant form of diphtheria toxin (CRM197), as well as the less-commonly used protein,rEPA. The former three carrier proteins have been used extensively in existing glycoconjugate vaccines, are known to be safe and effective at inducing T-dependent responses to the carbohydrate moiety, but do not result in an immune response against any otherSalmonellaantigens. Vi-TT and Vi-rEPA vaccines are already licensed for in-country used in India and China. None of these carriers areSalmonellaproteins. It has been argued that glycoconjugates employingSalmonellaproteins could be more effective than those with exogenous carriers, as they would target the immune response to two differentSalmonellaantigens instead of one. None,NoneConjugation toSalmonellaproteins also offers the possibility of inducingSalmonella-specific T cells. 35 y ago, Svenson and colleagues showed that O:4 conjugated to Typhimurium porins gave better protection in mice that vaccination with porin vaccines alone or an O:4-DT conjugate. NoneMore recently, investigators at the CVD have found enhanced immunogenicity and protective effect using iNTS vaccines with O:4,5 and O:9 conjugated toSalmonellaflagellin compared with flagellin alone. None,NoneAlthough only licensed in India, BioMed have been the first company to license aSalmonellaconjugate vaccine: a Vi-TT vaccine, Peda Typh. NoneAnother Indian company, Bharat Biotech have registered their Vi-TT vaccine (Typbar-TT) in India, and the Lanzhou Institute of Biological Products, in partnership with the US National Institutes of Health, licensed their Vi-rEPA vaccine in China. NoneThe Vi-CRM197vaccine developed by NVGHNone-Nonewas tested in Phase 1 and 2 trials in adults in Europe,Nonefollowed by Phase 2 trials evaluation in adults, children and infants in India, Pakistan and the Philippines. NoneWhile being far more immunogenic than Vi CPS vaccine, anti-Vi response following revaccination was lower than after primary vaccination. Vi-CRM197technology is currently being transferred to Biological E. Meanwhile, the International Vaccine Institute and Shanta Biotech have developed a Vi-DT vaccine. None-NoneA related approach to that of the Vi glycoconjugate vaccines is protein capsular matrix vaccine (PCMV) technology by the Matrivax Research and Development Corporation that entraps the Vi polysaccharide in a matrix of CRM197. NoneA key issue with these Vi-conjugate vaccines is that they offer no protection themselves against enteric fever caused byS. Paratyphi A or strains of Typhi that might not express Vi. Phase 1 and 2 clinical studies with an O:2-TT vaccine targeted againstS. Paratyphi ANonewere conducted 14 y ago in Vietnamese adults and children by the NIH group and found to be safe and immunogenic. NoneThe technology for this vaccine has subsequently been transferred to the Chengdu and Lanzhou Institutes of Biological Products, with the Lanzhou Institute currently conducting a Phase 2 trial with the vaccine. Other O:2 glycoconjugates using DT and CRM197have been developed and tested in preclinical studies by IVINone,Noneand NVGHNone,Nonerespectively. Both have been developed alongside Vi conjugate vaccines in order to be used in bivalent combinations and protect against both main forms of enteric fever. The NVGH O:2-CRM197technology is also being transferred to Biological E as part of a bivalent vaccine with Vi-CRM197. As mentioned previously, the development of conjugate vaccines against iNTS has lagged behind those for enteric fever, despite early preclinical proof of concept studies in mice at the National Bacteriology Laboratory in Sweden, using, among other candidate vaccines, O:4 conjugated to porin,Noneand at the NIH with O:4-TT conjugates. NoneIn addition to the O:4,5- and O:9-flagellin vaccines of CVD, the technology for which is being transferred to Bharat Biotech, NVGH has developed and tested similar vaccines conjugated to CRM197in preclinical studies. NoneGiven the emergence and spread of typhoid fever in sub-Saharan Africa, it will be important to know whether O:9 conjugates can protect againstS. Typhi as well asS. Enteritidis. Although new live-attenuated vaccines have received less attention recently compared with the glycoconjugate vaccines, this vaccine strategy has a number of potential advantages. Live-attenuated vaccines have excellent ability to elicitSalmonella-specific T cell responses required for clearance of residual infection, can be given orally and have good capacity to induce mucosal immunity through lymphocyte expression of mucosal homing receptors. NoneThe delivery of multipleSalmonellaantigens to the immune system raises the possibility of inducing broad protective coverage acrossSalmonellaserovars. Molecular biology has advanced greatly since the time when Ty21a was developed using random mutagenesis. The ability to introduce targeted mutations and genetic modifications combined with the full availability of the bacterial genomes from whole genome sequencing has considerably improved the capacity to rationally design new live-attenuated vaccines. The major challenge in the development of live-attenuated vaccines is in attaining an optimal level of attenuation without compromising immunogenicity. Attenuation is required both to prevent persistent infection and disease from the vaccine itself, a particularly important consideration in populations such as those in sub-Saharan Africa with high prevalence of HIV infection, and to minimise reactogenicity. Unfortunately, immunogenicity often decreases alongside reactogenicity whenSalmonellaare attenuated. NoneA further consideration is to develop live vaccines that require fewer doses than Ty21a and are more heat-stable. Three live attenuated vaccines against typhoid fever have been developed and tested in Phase 2 trials. CVD 909 is the latest in a series of live-attenuated vaccines developed by CVD. It has attenuating mutations in thearoC,aroDandhtrAgenes, but is distinguished from its predecessors by the replacement of the PNonepromoter, which controls Vi expression, with the strong constitutive PNonepromoter. This ensures constitutive Vi expression,None-Nonewhich has been lacking from many live attenuatedS. Typhi vaccines, either through complete lack of expression (as for Ty21a) or due to switching off of Vi expression during in vivo infection. The Ty800 vaccine developed by Avant Immunotherapeutics has a disruptedaroCgene and mutatedssaVgene. None,NoneM01ZH09 from Emergent Biosolutions has mutations in thePho/PhoQregulator genes. None-NoneAll are based on the Ty2 parent strain and have good safety, tolerability and immunogenicity profiles inducing mucosal as well as systemic antibodies. As for the glycoconjugates, live attenuated oral vaccines againstS. Paratyphi A and iNTS are further behind on the development pathway. CVD has tested its candidate liveS. Paratyphi A vaccine CVD 1902 in a Phase 1 trial with a plan to use this in combination with CVD 909 to protect against both forms of enteric fever. CVD have also developed and conducted preclinical studies with live iNTS vaccines. These consist ofS. Typhimurium andS. Enteritidis with deletedguaBAandclpPgenes and could protect against lethal challenge with the homologous serovar in mice. NoneThe only live-attenuated iNTS vaccine to be tested to date in man is WT05, aS. Typhimurium with the samearoCandssaVattenuations asS. Typhi Ty800. This Phase 1 study found prolonged stool shedding in volunteers for up to 23 d,Noneand the vaccine has not been tested further. Many other candidate live attenuatedS. Typhimurium vaccines have been tested in mice,None-Nonebut none have so far been into clinical trials. These includeSalmonellastains attenuated through mutation of DNA adenine methylase which acts as a global regulator of gene expression. None,NoneAnother promising strategy is the introduction of mutations inSalmonellathat lead to regulated delayed attenuation in vivo through mechanisms including dependency on key nutrients that are absent in host tissues, and programmed lysis. None-NoneThe main alternative subunit approach toSalmonellavaccines from the glycoconjugates is the development of vaccines from recombinant or purified proteins. None,None,NoneThese potentially have the advantage of cross-protection if carefully selected through bioinformatic analysis of whole genome sequences as part of a reverse vaccinology approach to vaccine antigen discovery. NoneAs proteins, such vaccines can induce both antibody and T cell responses. There are issues with preserving the conformation of proteins with multiple membrane-spanning domains that can result in the induction of antibodies with poor function on immunization. Such proteins may be better prepared by purification from wholeSalmonellarather than recombinant technology. NoneA better knowledge of the B cell and T cell epitopes ofSalmonellawould be of great help for advancing the protein-based vaccine approach. The proteins that have received most attention to date have been flagellin and porins OmpC, F and D. As described earlier, preclinical studies in the mouse model have demonstrated promise for all of these antigens with immunization resulting in protection againstSalmonellachallenge. None,None,None,NoneOmpC and F induce long-lasting antibody responses in miceNoneand have been found to be safe and immunogenic when tested in a Phase 1 study in man. NoneHowever, such vaccines are not necessarily amenable to simple production methods. The importance of preserving the correct conformation of such antigens has been indicated by the failure of recombinantSalmonellaporins to protect mice. NoneAn innovative strategy to maintain the conformational integrity ofSalmonellaantigens, while avoiding laborious purification steps, is GMMA technology. GMMA (Generalized Modules for Membrane Antigens)None,Noneare small particles of 50 to 90 nm diameter consisting of blebs of outer membrane. There shedding from the surface of Gram-negative bacteria, such asSalmonella, is enhanced following the genetic deletion of proteins that span the periplasm and serve to maintain the integrity of the inner and outer membranes. Deletion of thetolRgene ofSalmonellaandShigellaNone,None,Noneresults in the upregulation of this shedding process enabling the production of very high vaccine substance yields. Further deletions of genes, such as those encoding the late acyltransferases HtrBNoneand MsbB,Noneresulting in the removal of acyl groups from the lipid A moiety of LPS, are incorporated to reduce reactogenicity. Unlike the case with live-attenuated vaccines, there is no possibility of infection. Purification is straightforward and economical, consisting of two tangential flow filtration steps. NonePreclinical studies indicate that GMMA vaccines can deliver both surface polysaccharide and outer membrane proteins to the immune system and that they are more immunogenic than glycoconjugate vaccines. This is likely to be partly because antigens are delivered in their correct conformation and orientation, but also through the self-adjuvanting properties of GMMA which deliver innate signals through TLR ligands and other pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). GMMA also have good potential to induceSalmonella-specific T cell immunity. The combination of high yield and a simple production process makes this a highly-affordable technology, particularly suited for the development of vaccines for low- and middle-income countries, where cost-of-goods is a key consideration. NoneAs the reactogenicity relative to the immunogenicity of GMMA vaccines in man is currently unknown, clinical trials (currently underway for aShigella sonneiGMMA vaccine) are required to assess the safety and tolerability of this vaccine platform. The licensure and large-scale implementation ofS. Typhi glycoconjugate vaccines, foreseeable in the next few years, represents a major step forward for global health. The introduction of glycoconjugate vaccines has been a successful public health intervention against other encapsulated bacteria, particularly among infants and young children. It will be important to drive forward first vaccines against the other principal invasiveSalmonellaserovars: Paratyphi A, Typhimurium and Enteritidis. Improved surveillance of invasiveSalmonelladisease across the developing world, which is currently inadequate, will be key for assessing the impact of such new vaccines and detecting changes in the epidemiology ofSalmonelladisease which may be accelerated by their implementation. A key unresolved scientific question is whether the glycoconjugates, which rely on the induction of antibodies against surface polysaccharides as their principal mechanism of action, will be sufficient to effectively deal with the global problem of invasiveSalmonelladisease, particularly iNTS disease. While glycoconjugates are set to make a major impact, the possibility of serovar replacement and the challenge of iNTS disease among HIV-infected Africans, where lack of antibodies toSalmonelladoes not appear underlie susceptibility to NTS, supports the development of second and third generation vaccines. These include new live-attenuated, protein-based and GMMA-based vaccines, which could potentially induce broader protection together withSalmonella-specific T cell responses.
