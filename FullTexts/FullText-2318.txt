What do you think the most likely diagnosis is? NoneNoneNoneNoneA left renal tumourAn abdominal aortic aneurysmAn aneurysm of the common iliac arteryCancer of the head of the pancreasThe CT scan shows a calcified aortic wall. The antero-posterior diameter of the aorta is six centimetres. There is also a mural thrombus lining the aortic wall which is seen as grey in colour. There is no extravasation of contrast (leaking of the contrast into the abdominal cavity) which suggests that the aneurysm is not leaking. NoneNoneNoneThe left superior renal pole is seen on this CT with a normal pattern of parenchymal enhancement following the administration of intravenous contrast. The kidney is retroperitoneal like the aorta, but lies more posteriorly within the left flank. The aorta bifurcates more caudally / distally into common iliac arteries. Whilst the head of the pancreas is retroperitoneal like the aorta, the pancreas lies anterior to the aorta at the level of the origin of the coeliac trunk from the aorta (which is higher than this CT slice). Abdominal aortic aneurysms are usually due to degeneration in the media (the middle part) of the arterial wall. This leads to gradual dilatation of the lumen of the vessel and weakness of the vessel wall leading to aneurysm rupture. Risk factors associated with the development of an abdominal aortic aneurysm includeNone:NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneIncreasing age.Smoking.Hypertension. Atherosclerosis (Male gender): Aneurysms are 4-fold more common in men than in women with a prevalence at 65 - 75 years of 16.9% for men and 3.5% for women. NoneFamily history: The risk of developing an abdominal aortic aneurysm is between 1-2% in the general population. NoneIn patients with at least one 1stdegree relative the risk is between 13-32%. Aneurysms also occur at a younger age and are more likely rupture in patients with a family history the condition. Syndromes and diseases associated with abnormal connective tissue and collagen production, such as Marfan's and Ehlers-Danlos syndromes. Mycotic aneurysm : A rare phenomenon occurring either when a new aneurysm is produced by infection of the arterial wall, or when a pre-existing aneurysm becomes infected. The UK pilot programme for screening of abdominal aortic aneurysm in men over 65 started in 2012. Men will be offered an ultrasound as part of the screening programme. The incidence of abdominal aortic aneurysm in women is too low to warrant population screening in this group. (www.aneurysmscreening.co.uk). NoneNoneNoneCT scan of the abdomen. The signs and symptoms of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm can be subtle. The symptoms include:NoneNoneNoneNoneBack pain, syncope, and vomiting. You should examine for a palpable mass in all patients with abdominal pain. However, only 25-50% of patients with a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm present with a pulsatile mass associated with hypotension, tachycardia. NoneThese three signs may be subtle because of retroperitoneal containment of the haematoma. Expanding or dissecting aneurysms can cause flank and loin pain, which can be mistaken for renal colic.
