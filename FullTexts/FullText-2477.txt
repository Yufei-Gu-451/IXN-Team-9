Phosphoinositides are phospholipids derived from the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol at the 3-, 4- and 5-positions of the inositol ring1,2. The seven phosphoinositides are differentially localized on the cytosolic leaflets of cellular membranes, where they play a critical role in controlling interactions that occur at their surface. Via this mechanism, which helps generate a code of membrane identity, they regulate a multiplicity of cellular processes1,2. Among phosphoinositides, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) plays numerous fundamental roles in the Golgi complex, the endosomal system, and the plasma membrane1,2,3. PI4P is a biosynthetic precursor of PI(4,5)P2and thus an upstream metabolite in metabolic pathways leading to diacylglycerol (DAG), IP3, and PI(3,4,5)P34. In addition, PI4P can contribute to the regulation of other membrane lipids, including sterols5,6,7,8, phosphatidylserine9, and sphingolipids10. Therefore, tight regulation of PI4P levels is important for a variety of cellular functions. In mammals, four enzymes can phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol at the 4-position of the inositol ring to generate PI4P2,3. Of the four enzymes, PI 4-kinase type IIIalpha (PI4KIIIalpha; Stt4 in yeast) plays a major role in the generation of PI4P at the plasma membrane11,12,13,14. This enzyme is of fundamental physiological importance, as germline disruption of its gene in mice produces embryonic lethality, and its conditional disruption in mouse fibroblasts results in cell death11,15,16. Interest in this enzyme has been recently enhanced by its identification as a critical host factor for the replication of the hepatitis C virus in humans17,18,19. PI4KIIIalpha/Stt4 localizes to the plasma membrane as part of an evolutionarily conserved complex comprising two adaptor proteins (each of them represented by two similar A and B isoforms), the peripheral membrane protein EFR3 and the scaffolding protein TTC7 (Ypp1 in yeast)11,12,20. Studies in yeast have identified an additional regulator of Stt4, termed Sfk1 (suppressor of four-kinase 1), a multipass transmembrane protein localized at the plasma membrane, whose overexpression partially rescues defects in a temperature-sensitive Stt4 mutant strain21. Sfk1 physically interacts with Stt4, and loss of Sfk1 compromises proper plasma membrane localization of Stt421. Despite the importance of Sfk1 in the regulation of Stt4 localization and function in yeast, no mammalian counterpart of Sfk1 has yet been reported, and major outstanding questions remain about how the PI4KIIIalpha complex is regulated at the plasma membrane. Here, we identify TMEM150A as a mammalian homologue of yeast Sfk1. TMEM150A forms a complex at the plasma membrane with PI4KIIIalpha and EFR3, but not TTC7, suggesting a plasticity of the protein interactions of PI4KIIIalpha. We also find that levels of TMEM150A impact the rate of PI(4,5)P2re-synthesis following acute depletion of this lipid, possibly due to an impact of this protein on the pool of PI4P available for the synthesis of PI(4,5)P2. BLAST searches for amino acid sequences in higher eukaryotes related to regions of Sfk1 highly conserved among various species of yeast and fungi yielded members of the mammalian TMEM150/FRAG1/DRAM family, whose defining structural feature is the presence of six predicted transmembrane regions (Fig1A). DRAM (Damage-Regulated Autophagy Regulator) 1 and 2 were reported to be localized in lysosomal membranes and to function as p53-induced modulators of autophagy22,23. TMEM150A, TMEM150B, and TMEM150C remain uncharacterized. Thus, we explored whether TMEM150A proteins could be functional homologues of yeast Sfk1 in the control of the localization and function of PI4KIIIalpha, the mammalian homologue of yeast Stt421.

B Confocal imaging of live HeLa cells transfected with TMEM150A-GFP, TMEM150B-GFP, and TMEM150C-GFP as indicated. Scale bars: 20 mum. C Western blot analysis for GFP and PI4KIIIalpha of anti-GFP immunoprecipitates from lysates of HeLa cells transfected with GFP or TMEM150A-GFP fusion proteins. C-terminally GFP-tagged TMEM150A, TMEM150B, or TMEM150C were transiently expressed in HeLa cells. TMEM150A-GFP and TMEM150B-GFP were predominantly localized at the plasma membrane, and only a minor pool of these proteins was localized on intracellular structures. TMEM150C-GFP was localized at the plasma membrane, but a greater pool of this protein was localized on intracellular vesicular structures (Fig1B) that co-localized with RFP-tagged LAMP1 (a lysosomal marker) (Supplementary Fig S1). Western blot analysis of anti-GFP immunoprecipitates generated from these cells, and from cells expressing GFP alone as a control, revealed coprecipitation of PI4KIIIalpha with TMEM150A, although not B or C (Fig1C). Based on these results, we further explored the properties of TMEM150A and its potential function in PI4KIIIalpha regulation. To determine the topology of TMEM150A within the plasma membrane, live HeLa cells expressing TMEM150A-GFP were exposed to an anti-GFP antibody at 4 degrees C without permeabilization by detergent. While intrinsic GFP fluorescence was observed, anti-GFP immunostaining did not give any signal without prior fixation and permeabilization (Fig2A, upper panel), indicating that the C-terminal tail of TMEM150A is oriented toward the cytosol. By contrast, immunofluorescence analysis of a construct containing an HA tag in the middle of Loop 1 (termed HA-TMEM150A-GFP) produced fluorescence without any prior permeabilization, suggesting that Loop 1 is exposed to the extracellular medium (Fig2A, bottom panel). Based on these results, we hypothesized that TMEM150A has the topology illustrated in Fig2B, with a C-terminal cytosolic tail.

D Anti-FLAG and anti-GFP Western blots of immunoprecipitates generated from lysates of HeLa cells double-transfected with 3 * FLAG-PI4KIIIalpha and either TMEM150A-GFP, TMEM150B-GFP, or Chimera-GFP. Next, we determined the region of TMEM150A responsible for the recovery of a pool of PI4KIIIalpha in anti-TMEM150A-GFP immunoprecipitates. The C-tail is the major portion of TMEM150A protruding toward the cytosol. Thus, we focused on this region. Because TMEM150B-GFP does not coprecipitate PI4KIIIalpha, we generated a chimeric protein (Chimera) in which the C-tail of TMEM150A was appended to the C-terminus of full-length TMEM150B (Fig2B). This Chimera was targeted to the plasma membrane, similar to both TMEM150A-GFP and TMEM150B-GFP, indicating that its longer C-tail did not affect its subcellular targeting (Fig2C). Anti-GFP immunoprecipitation experiments were then performed in cells coexpressing 3 * FLAG-PI4KIIIalpha and either TMEM150A-GFP, TMEM150B-GFP, or Chimera-GFP. As shown in Fig2D, anti-FLAG Western blotting revealed that PI4KIIIalpha coprecipitated to the same extent with either TMEM150A or with Chimera, while it did not coprecipitate with TMEM150B. We conclude that the portion of TMEM150A required for the formation of a complex with PI4KIIIalpha possibly indirectly is its cytosolic C-tail. We previously reported that PI4KIIIalpha forms a complex with EFR3B and TTC7B at the plasma membrane11and that both EFR3B and TTC7B are required for PI4KIIIalpha targeting to the plasma membrane (SupplementaryFig S2)11,12,20: EFR3 is the plasma membrane-anchored component11,20, while PI4KIIIalpha is recruited to EFR3 indirectly by TTC7 (see5Fig F)11,20. In view of the recovery of a pool endogenous PI4KIIIalpha in anti-TMEM150A-GFP immunoprecipitates, as described above, we explored whether overexpression of TMEM150A in HeLa cells could bypass the need for EFR3 and TTC7 in the plasma membrane recruitment of PI4KIIIalpha. As shown by Fig3A, this was not the case, as GFP-PI4KIIIalpha had a diffuse cytosolic distribution in cells expressing TMEM150A-mCherry, which was localized in the plasma membrane. This discrepancy between the two localizations is consistent with the low recovery of PI4KIIIalpha in anti-TMEM150A-GFP immunoprecipitates, in spite of the specificity of this recovery (Fig3B). Co-overexpression of tagged PI4KIIIalpha, EFR3B, TTC7B, and TMEM150A in different combinations revealed that plasma membrane targeting of PI4KIIIalpha occurred only when both TTC7 and EFR3 were also co-overexpressed (Fig3A). Thus, even in the presence of co-overexpressed TMEM150A, efficient plasma membrane targeting of GFP-PI4KIIIalpha requires co-overexpression of both EFR3 and TTC7. However, while overexpression of EFR3 increases the recovery of GFP-PI4KIIIalpha in anti-TMEM150A-GFP immunoprecipitates (see below in Fig3C), a small pool of GFP-PI4KIIIalpha is recovered in such immunoprecipitates also when only endogenous EFR3 is present or even after EFR3 (EFR3A and EFR3B) knockdown (Fig3B). Conversely, siRNA-mediated knockdown of TMEM150A did not change the subcellular localization pattern of PI4KIIIalpha, EFR3B, and TTC7B when each of these proteins was overexpressed alone or in various combinations (SupplementaryFig S3).

D Western blot analysis for the epitopes and protein indicated, of starting lysates and anti-GFP immunoprecipitates generated from HeLa cells treated with control and PI4KIIIalpha-specific siRNA 24 h prior to transfection of EFR3B-HA and TMEM150A-GFP as shown at the top. As our data support a link of TMEM150A to PI4KIIIalpha, we explored whether TMEM150A interacts with EFR3 and TTC7 using biochemical experiments. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with 3 * FLAG-PI4KIIIalpha, EFR3B-HA, TTC7B-mCherry, and either TMEM150A-GFP or GFP. Extracts prepared from these cells were then immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibodies. Western blotting of immunoprecipitates from TMEM150A-GFP-expressing cells, but not of those from GFP-expressing cells, revealed robust presence of both PI4KIIIalpha and EFR3, but surprisingly, not of TTC7B (Fig3C), suggesting the occurence of a complex between TMEM150A, PI4KIIIalpha, and EFR3B that is distinct from the previously reported PI4KIIIalpha/EFR3B/TTC7B complex11,12,20. Notably, when using cells expressing only TMEM150A-GFP and EFR3B-HA, a robust recovery of EFR3B-HA in TMEM150A-GFP immunoprecipitates, which was not affected by the siRNA-mediated knockdown of PI4KIIIalpha, was observed, revealing an interaction of these two plasma membrane-localized proteins (Fig3D). Lack of dependence of the TMEM150A-EFR3 interaction on the presence of PI4KIIIalpha was not unexpected because TTC7 is known to function as a bridge between PI4KIIIalpha and EFR311,20, and the PI4KIIIalpha/EFR3B/TMEM150A-GFP complex does not include TTC7. We further explored the surprising absence of TTC7 in PI4KIIIalpha-EFR3B-TMEM150A complexes, as TTC7 overexpression was needed to target efficiently PI4KIIIalpha to the plasma membrane under all conditions. As previously described, TTC7B-mCherry has a diffuse cytosolic localization when expressed alone11, but is recruited to the plasma membrane when co-expressed with EFR3, its direct and plasma membrane-localized interactor11(Fig4Aand B). However, the additional expression of TMEM150A-GFP in cells co-expressing TTC7B-mCherry and EFR3 abolished the plasma membrane localization of TTC7B (Fig4C). Thus, the interaction of EFR3 with either TTC7 or with TMEM150A appears to be mutually exclusive. We corroborated this microscopic finding with biochemical experiments. In cells transfected with TMEM150A-GFP, EFR3B-HA, and TTC7B-FLAG, analysis of anti-EFR3B (anti-HA) and anti-TTC7B (anti-FLAG) immunoprecipitates revealed that TTC7B did not co-immunoprecipitate with EFR3B (Fig4D, top panel, compare lanes 9 and 10). Vice versa, EFR3B did not coimmunoprecipitate with TTC7B (Fig4D, bottom panel, compare lanes 8 and 10), if TMEM150A-GFP was also present. The appearance of a TTC7 fragment in cells overexpressing TMEM150A (Fig4D, asterisk) may reflect an impact of TMEM150A on TTC7 stability. The interaction of the EFR3-PI4KIIIalpha complex with TMEM150A is mutually exclusive with the interaction with TTC7NoneNoneNoneA-C Confocal imaging of live HeLa cells transfected with TTC7B-mCherry alone or with EFR3B-HA and TMEM150A-GFP as indicated.

E Western blot analysis for the epitopes and proteins indicated, of starting lysates and anti-GFP immunoprecipitates generated from HeLa cells transfected with 3 * FLAG-PI4KIIIalpha, EFR3B-HA, TMEM150A-mCherry, and TTC7B-GFP as shown at the top. We also assessed more directly if TTC7 is only present in complexes that exclude TMEM150A in HeLa cells overexpression expressing various combinations of the four proteins (PI4KIIIalpha, EFR3, TMEM150A, and TTC7B), using TTC7-GFP as a bait in immunoprecipitation experiments. Both EFR3B and PI4KIIIalpha were recovered in the immunoprecipitates in the absence of TMEM150A overexpression (Fig4E, lane 5), but no EFR3B was recovered and the recovery of PI4KIIIalpha was strongly reduced when TMEM150A was overexpressed (Fig4E, lane 6). Collectively, these results demonstrate that the interaction of EFR3 with TMEM150A is mutually exclusive with the interaction of TTC7 with EFR3 and that EFR3 and TMEM150A form a complex at the plasma membrane that does not include TTC7. Concerning PI4KIIIalpha, its recruitment and concentration in the plasma membrane is critically dependent on TTC7 expression even if the bulk of TTC7 is cytosolic in the presence of TMEM150A. We hypothesize that a complex of PI4KIIIalpha comprising TTC7 may represent an intermediate needed for the targeting/presentation of PI4KIIIalpha to plasma membrane. At this membrane, the EFR3-TTC7 interaction is competed by the EFR3-TMEM150A interaction, which in turn leads to a stabilization of the plasma membrane localization of PI4KIIIalpha even in the absence of TTC7, indicating that also the TTC7-PI4KIIIalpha is lost. If TMEM150A plays a role in anchoring PI4KIIIalpha at the plasma membrane, one may expect its presence to have an impact of PI4P production in this membrane. In yeast, deletion of Sfk1 increases the severity of PI4P and PI(4,5)P2defects in a temperature-sensitiveSTT4mutant background21. To determine whether TMEM150A has a regulatory role in the metabolism of PI4P and its downstream metabolite PI(4,5)P2in mammalian cells, we first examined whether modulation of TMEM150A levels, via either overexpression or down-regulation through RNA interference, affects total levels of these phosphoinositides. As quantified by HPLC, no significant differences in the total levels of PI4P and PI(4,5)P2were observed in TMEM150A-overexpressing or knockdown cells (SupplementaryFig S4), although a modest decrease in the level of plasma membrane-associated PI4P, as detected by an immunofluorescence staining procedure15,24,25, was observed in the TMEM150A knockdown cells (SupplementaryFig S5). This result prompted us to investigate whether an effect of TMEM150A overexpression or knockdown on phosphoinositide metabolism could be revealed by monitoring the response to an acute perturbation. To this aim, we examined the efficiency of PI(4,5)P2resynthesis after triggered PLC-mediated hydrolysis. In cells transiently transfected with the M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M1R), stimulation with the agonist oxotremorine-M (Oxo-M) results in phospholipase C (PLC) activation, leading to the rapid and massive cleavage of plasma membrane PI(4,5)P2into IP3and DAG26. Subsequent application of the M1R antagonist atropine terminates PLC activation, allowing the cell to resynthesize PI(4,5)P2from PI4P at the plasma membrane. Importantly, it has been well established that PI(4,5)P2resynthesis under these conditions requires PI4P generation by PI4KIIIalpha13,15,25,27,28,29. We used this model and monitored PI(4,5)P2changes in the plasma membrane by examining the fluorescence of GFP-PHPLCdelta, a genetically encoded PI(4,5)P2marker, using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy26,30(Fig5A).

TTC7 interacts directly with both PI4KIIIalpha and EFR3. The presence of TMEM150A in a complex comprising PI4KIIIalpha is mutually exclusive to the presence in the complex of TTC7. The interactions of TMEM150A shown at the right were demonstrated biochemically and result in a positive regulation of PI4KIIIalpha but may be indirect. In pilot experiments, we confirmed the requirement of PI4KIIIalpha for PI(4,5)P2resynthesis, as this recovery was completely blocked by a very potent and highly specific PI4KIIIalpha inhibitor, the compound A115(Fig5A). Transient expression of TMEM150A accelerated PI(4,5)P2recovery (Fig5B), with an initial rate of PI(4,5)P2recovery about 150% higher than that of control cells (Fig5C). A similar effect was observed with the transient expression of the TMEM150 Chimera (Fig5B), supporting the critical importance of the C-terminal region of TMEM150A, that is, its PI4KIIIalpha binding region, in this effect. Conversely, knockdown of TMEM150A resulted in a reduction of the initial recovery rate of PI(4,5)P2levels, and the reduction was 'rescued' by co-expression of wild-type TMEM150A or the TMEM150 Chimera (Fig5Dand E). Collectively, our study corroborates evidence for an important role of an integral membrane protein conserved from yeast to humans, Sfk1/TMEM150A, in the function of PI4KIIIalpha to the plasma membrane. The occurence of a complex comprising PI4KIIIalpha and TTC7 that binds EFR3 is strongly supported by genetic, biochemical, and structural data11,12,20. Our present findings support a critical role of TTC7 together with EFR3 in the targeting of PI4KIIIalpha to the plasma membrane. However, they also indicate that accumulation of TTC7 at the plasma membrane along with EFR3 and PI4KIIIalpha is under the control of TMEM150A, as TMEM150A overexpression prevents such accumulation. We suggest the occurrence of two separate PI4KIIIalpha-containing complexes: (1) a complex comprising PI4KIIIalpha, EFR3, and TTC7, which is required for initial targeting of PI4KIIIalpha to the plasma membrane and predominates in the absence of overexpressed TMEM150A; (2) another complex only in the plasma membrane that comprises PI4KIIIalpha, EFR3, and TMEM150A, but that excludes TTC7 and predominates when TMEM150A is overexpressed. Additional work is required to test this hypothesis. It is also possible that levels of TMEM150A may control interactions of TTC7 indirectly. Collectively, however, our data clearly reveal a plasticity of the PI4KIIIalpha complex. The mechanisms underlying this plasticity remain unknown. Additionally, our data show that the presence of TMEM150A positively regulates PI4P production. As members of the Sfk1/TMEM150A comprise a highly conserved region containing six predicted transmembrane spans, they are unlikely to act simply as membrane-anchoring factors for Stt4/PI4KIIIalpha and may affect PI4KIIIalpha function both directly and indirectly. The expression of five TMEM150 family members with different localization and properties in mammalian cells further supports this possibility. Addressing these properties and their potential impact on the dynamics of PI4P is an important priority for future work in this field. For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were incubated with Chromotek GFP-trap agarose beads (Allele Biotech), anti-HA affinity matrix (Roche), or anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma-Aldrich), and the solubilized bead-bound material was processed for SDS-PAGE and standard procedure of immunoblotting.
