# IXN-Team-9

Project Keyword : Remote consultations analysis / Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) / Natural Language Processing (NLP) / Automatic Text Summarization (ATS) / Medical database

Project Description : Use natural language processing or understanding to allow audio individualised records - a set of smart documents with a common infrastructure but individually populated using the NLP captured from remote consultation. The aim is for near real-time electronic documents to be created for the clinical team - clinical documentation -, the patient or parents, to improve patient understanding and experience, and for the laboratory diagnostics, to ensure the correct test with the necessary clinical history.
