The Speech SDK exposes many features from the speech service, but not all of them. The Speech SDK is ideal for both real time and non real time scenarios using local devices files, Azure blob storage and even input and output streams. When a scenario is not achievable with the speech SDK, look for a rest API alternative speech to text, also known as speech recognition, transcribes audio streams to text that your applications, tools, or devices can consume or display.
