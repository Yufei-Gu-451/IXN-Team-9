Gemcitabine is a nucleoside analogue that primarily targets cells undergoing DNA synthesis (S-phase) and also blocks progression of cells through the G1/S-phase boundary. Targeting PDGF and VEGF signalling pathways with sunitinib plus gemcitabine may enhance antitumor activity compared with either agent alone. Our study focused on patients with RCC and pancreatic cancer (adenocarcinoma), for whom sunitinib and gemcitabine are standard treatments, respectively. The population comprised patients aged ?18 years with life expectancy ?12 weeks and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1. Other inclusion criteria included adequate organ function and haematological parameters without transfusion requirement (erythropoietin or darbepoietin permitted). Planned dose-escalation schemes for sunitinib (both schedules) and gemcitabine are shown inTable 1. The initial cohorts were expanded to six patients if 1/3 patients experienced a DLT (as defined below) during cycle 1. In addition, up to six additional patients could be included at specific dose levels on either schedule to further define the observed toxicity profile. After moving to the Schedule 2/1 dose-escalation phase, the original protocol was amended to allow use of growth factor support. On day 8, if absolute neutrophil count (ANC) was greater than 1000 cellsper mm3, gemcitabine was given as scheduled. The primary objective was to assess the MTD and overall safety and tolerability of sunitinib administered in combination with gemcitabine in patients with advanced solid tumours. Objective tumour response was assessed according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST Version 1.0) (TherasseNone, 2000). Pharmacokinetics parameters were calculated for each subject by noncompartmental analysis of concentration-time data using WinNonlin version 4.1. Of the 36 patients on Schedule 2/1, 11 were enrolled before the protocol amendment that allowed the use of growth factor support and 25 were enrolled post-amendment. Eleven patients total (all on Schedule 2/1) received growth factor support, including one patient before the amendment. Baseline patient characteristics (all patients and patients treated on Schedule 2/1, post-amendment) are summarised inTable 2. Fifty per cent or more of patients were on treatment for more than 6 months at all dose levels, except the lowest (sunitinib 37.5 mg plus 750 mg m-2). However, several patients treated on this regimen either missed or had delayed doses of gemcitabine because of slow recovery from neutropenia, and it was decided not to pursue this regimen further. For the patient with grade 3 QT-prolongation, which began on cycle 1, day 8, the AE resolved after sunitinib dose interruption for 3 days and dose reduction. Treatment-related AEs (grade ?3) occurring among the 25 patients on Schedule 2/1, post-amendment, are detailed inTable 3. Pharmacokinetics data were evaluated for dose levels 1-6 of Schedule 2/1 (Table 1). This would explain the lower sunitinib exposure at day 8 compared with day 15 when steady state concentrations were achieved. However, overall, there was no evidence of clinically relevant drug-drug interaction between sunitinib and gemcitabine based on drug exposure at any dose level. A further 18 patients (41%), including 12 (48%) on schedule 2/1, post-amendment, had stable disease (s.d.) ranging from 10.3 to 47.9 weeks, yielding clinical benefit rates of 59% (total population) and 76% (Schedule 2/1 post-amendment), respectively. Among 25 patients on Schedule 2/1, post amendment, PRs were observed in 7 patients across the full range of doses: two with pancreatic carcinoma and five with RCC. Across all schedules and cohorts, 6/23 patients (26%) with RCC achieved a PR and 13 patients (57%) exhibited s.d. We conducted a phase I dose-escalation study of sunitinib combined with gemcitabine in patients with advanced solid tumours. No DLTs occurred at the maximum doses on Schedule 2/1, post-amendment, and most AEs were grade 1 or 2. Clinically significant non-haematological AEs were rare and no treatment-related deaths were observed despite the advanced nature of the patient population. In addition, co-administration of sunitinib with gemcitabine did not appear to affect the PK of gemcitabine. In addition, although it is difficult to ascertain efficacy differences in a relatively small study such as this, efficacy with Schedule 2/1 appeared superior to that with Schedule 4/2. This may be related to better tolerability with Schedule 2/1, allowing patients to continue on therapy longer, with fewer interruptions, particularly after the introduction of growth factor use. The antitumor activity observed in patients with poor-risk, high grade, or sarcomatoid RCC is noteworthy. There is no standard treatment for sarcomatoid RCC patients, and new treatment options for both of these particularly challenging RCC subgroups are urgently needed. In that study, 6/21 patients (29%) treated with sunitinib achieved a PR and a further nine patients treated with sunitinib (43%) had s.d. Improved patient selection based on identification of predictive biomarkers may be critical for determining patient subsets likely to derive meaningful clinical benefit from combinations of cytotoxic and targeted therapy. Preliminary antitumor data suggest clinical benefit in patients with particular malignancies, including poor-risk RCC.
