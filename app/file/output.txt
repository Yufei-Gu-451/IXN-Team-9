Extensive preclinical evidence suggests additive and/or synergistic effects in solid tumour models when a variety of chemotherapies, including gemcitabine, are combined with targeted agents, including sunitinib (YeeNone, 2004;CarterNone, 2007;ChristensenNone, 2008), as demonstrated in a recently reported phase I trial of sunitinib on a continuous daily dosing schedule plus gemcitabine in patients with advanced solid tumours (BrellNone, 2012). The phase I dose-finding study reported here was also conducted to investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and antitumor activity of sunitinib (on an intermittent dosing schedule) in combination with gemcitabine in patients with advanced solid tumours for whom curative therapy was not available. Schedule 4/2 was not evaluated past the initial combination dose level (sunitinib 37.5 mg and gemcitabine 750 mg m-2) as it proved to be an awkward scheduling regimen in practice because of missed or delayed doses of gemcitabine (see Determination of MTD). Two of eleven patients (18%) on Schedule 2/1, pre-amendment, had DLTs at the dose level of sunitinib 37.5 mg+gemcitabine 750 mg m-2(appendicitis/abscess and QTc prolongation). Schedule 4/2 was not pursued beyond the initial dose level of sunitinib 37.5 mg plus gemcitabine 750 mg m-2for practical reasons (i.e., because of missed or delayed doses of gemcitabine because of slow recovery from neutropenia). In the earlier phase I trial with gemcitabine, growth factor support was excluded and the recommended phase II dose was gemcitabine 675 mg m-2on days 1 and 8 and sunitinib 25 mg on continuous daily dosing (BrellNone, 2012). Our results also suggest that sunitinib combined with gemcitabine may be a more active regimen than gemcitabine-based chemotherapy, which has also shown limited activity in sarcomatoid RCC (StadlerNone, 2003;NanusNone, 2004).
