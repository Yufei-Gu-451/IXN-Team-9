Trisomy 18 Other Names: Chromosome 18 trisomy; 18 trisomy; Edwards syndrome; See More. Most cases are not inherited and occur sporadically (by chance). People with the same disease may not have all the symptoms listed. Use the HPO ID to access more in-depth information about a symptom. The extra genetic material from the 3rd copy of the chromosome disrupts development, causing the characteristic signs and symptoms of the condition. Very rarely, an extra piece of chromosome 18 is attached to another chromosome; this is called translocation trisomy 18, or partial trisomy 18. Inheritance
Most cases of trisomy 18 are not inherited and occur randomly due to errors in the formation of eggs or sperm. If an egg or sperm gains an extra copy of chromosome 18 during cell division and contributes to a pregnancy, the embryo will have an extra chromosome 18 (trisomy) in each cell of the body. Mosaic trisomy 18 (when some body cells have trisomy 18 and some have a normal chromosome make-up), is also typically not inherited. About 5% of affected people have a mosaic form of trisomy 18. Partial trisomy 18 (when only part of chromosome 18 is present in 3 copies) can be inherited. An unaffected parent can carry a rearrangement of genetic material between chromosome 18 and another chromosome. However, a person with a balanced translocation has an increased risk with each pregnancy to have a child with trisomy 18. Research
