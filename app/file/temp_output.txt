Compound3was reacted with variousN-alkylpiperazines in toluene at 120 degrees C for 2 h to yield compounds4a-4d, which were then converted to their correspondingN-oxides5a-5dby treating withmeta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (mCPBA) at room temperature in CH2Cl2for 10 min.

Likewise, compound11was prepared from compound3and piperazine in toluene at 120 degrees C for 2 h. Acetylation of compound11by AcCl in CH2Cl2at 0 degrees C in the presence of triethylamine (TEA) yielded compound12, which was subsequently reduced to the deuterated compound13using LiAlD4under reflux conditions, followed by quenching with CD3OD at 0 degrees C.

For the size of theN-alkyl group in compounds4a-4dand5a-5d, we observed a clear trend showing that the longer and/or bulkier theN-alkyl group, the weaker the compounds' potency for hM3Dq. The replacement of the methyl group in compounds4aand5awith then-propyl group in compounds4dand5dresulted in a potency decrease of approximately 70- and 100-fold, respectively. In addition to the loss in potency, the compounds with a longer or bulkierN-alkyl group (e.g., compounds4b-4dand5b-5d) in general displayed lower agonist efficacy for hM3Dq and became partial agonists of hM3Dq rather than full agonists as seen for compounds4aand5a. Interestingly, compounds4cand5c, which contain ani-propyl group, were more potent than compounds4dand5d, which contain an-propyl group, suggesting that the length of theN-alkyl group plays a more significant role than the bulkiness of theN-alkyl group in reducing agonist potency. We were also pleased to find that compounds4b-4dand5b-5ddid not display any agonist activity (EC50 greater than 30 000 nM) for the native human M3 receptor (hM3), in contrast to compound4a(clozapine), which was a hM3 agonist with sub-muM potency. In addition, compounds4a-4dwere in general more potent than their correspondingN-oxides5a-5dat activating hM3Dq, suggesting that the negative charge on theN-oxides is not only not required for activating hM3Dq, but also reduces agonist potency. The quaternary ammonium salt6was an extremely potent full agonist of hM3Dq with an EC50value of 69 pM and about 15-fold more potent than compound4a(clozapine). However, compound6was also a potent full agonist of hM3 (EC50= 9.5 nM,Emax= 92) even though it achieves greater than 100-fold higher potency for hM3Dq over hM3. On the other hand, compounds7,12, and14, which do not contain a basic amino group or a group with permanent positive charge, did not display any agonist activity for hM3Dq. Taken together, these results suggest that either a basic amino group as in compounds4aand4bor a group with permanent positive charge as in compounds5aand6is required to retain hM3Dq agonist activity. In addition, compound9that contains a hydantoin moiety and compound10that contains an amino acid moiety in this region did not activate hM3Dq and hM3. On the other hand, compound11, which is the des-methyl clozapine, showed similar potency and efficacy for hM3Dq and hM3 as clozapine, suggesting that theN-methyl group is not required for activating hM3Dq. None,NoneCompounds13and21are potent hM3Dq agonists and do not activate hM3 being similar to compound5a(CNO). We were also pleased to find that the 8-chloro group was not required to maintain high agonist potency and efficacy for hM3Dq. In particular, compound21was a potent full agonist (EC50= 1.7 nM,Emax= 100%) of hM3Dq (Figure2). In contrast to compound11, a full hM3 agonist with sub-micromolar potency, compound21displayed little agonist activity for hM3 (Emax= ?20%). We next selected a subset of the above hM3Dq agonists that are inactive against hM3 and assessed their binding affinities to other aminergic GPCRs. The high hM3Dq potency of perlapine suggests that the benzodiazepine tricyclic core of the CNO (compound5a) scaffold is not required for maintaining high hM3Dq agonist activity. We explored multiple regions of the CNO scaffold and observed the following interesting SAR trends: (1) a longer or bulkierN-alkyl group as in compounds4c,4d,5c, and5dreduces both potency and efficacy for hM3Dq; (2) a basic amino group as in compounds4aand4bor a permanent positive charge group as in compounds5aand6is required to retain hM3Dq agonist activity; (3) the negative change on theN-oxides such as5a-5dreduces hM3Dq agonist potency; (4) the 8-chloro group is not required to maintain high agonist potency and efficacy for hM3Dq; and (5) modifications to the benzodiazepine tricyclic core of CNO is tolerated. Furthermore, we discovered perlapine as a novel, potent hM3Dq agonist, which is greater than 10 000-fold selective for hM3Dq over hM3.
