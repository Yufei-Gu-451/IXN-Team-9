We extensively explored multiple regions of the scaffold represented by CNO, which resulted in the discovery of compounds13and21that are very potent hM3Dq agonists but do not activate the native human M3 receptor (hM3). We also report the discovery that perlapine, a hypnotic agent first reported in 1966,None-Noneis a novel, potent, and selective agonist of hM3Dq ( greater than 10 000-fold selective for hM3Dq over hM3). We also studied whether the chloro group (R3, highlighted in blue in Figure1) on the tricyclic core is required and whether a different tricyclic core (e.g., the core of the perlapine scaffold, see below) can be tolerated. We next synthesized the analogues outlined in Scheme2to determine whether the positive charge of CNO is required for activating hM3Dq. As illustrated in Scheme2, compound4a(clozapine) was converted to the quaternary ammonium iodide6by stirring overnight with CH3I in acetone at room temperature. Likewise, compound11was prepared from compound3and piperazine in toluene at 120 degrees C for 2 h. Acetylation of compound11by AcCl in CH2Cl2at 0 degrees C in the presence of triethylamine (TEA) yielded compound12, which was subsequently reduced to the deuterated compound13using LiAlD4under reflux conditions, followed by quenching with CD3OD at 0 degrees C. In addition, compound11was reacted with MsCl in CH2Cl2at 0 degrees C in the presence of diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) to give the methylsulfonamide14. To determine whether the 8-Cl group on the tricyclic core is required to activate hM3Dq, we prepared compounds21-23according to the synthetic route outlined in Scheme3. The newly synthesized compounds were evaluated in the hM3Dq and hM3 Ca2+mobilization fluorometric imaging plate reader (FLIPRTETRA) assays according to the protocols reported previously. None,None,NoneAgonist activities of these compounds in the hM3Dq and hM3 functional assays are summarized in Table1. For the size of theN-alkyl group in compounds4a-4dand5a-5d, we observed a clear trend showing that the longer and/or bulkier theN-alkyl group, the weaker the compounds' potency for hM3Dq. The replacement of the methyl group in compounds4aand5awith then-propyl group in compounds4dand5dresulted in a potency decrease of approximately 70- and 100-fold, respectively. In addition to the loss in potency, the compounds with a longer or bulkierN-alkyl group (e.g., compounds4b-4dand5b-5d) in general displayed lower agonist efficacy for hM3Dq and became partial agonists of hM3Dq rather than full agonists as seen for compounds4aand5a. We were also pleased to find that compounds4b-4dand5b-5ddid not display any agonist activity (EC50 greater than 30 000 nM) for the native human M3 receptor (hM3), in contrast to compound4a(clozapine), which was a hM3 agonist with sub-muM potency. In addition, compounds4a-4dwere in general more potent than their correspondingN-oxides5a-5dat activating hM3Dq, suggesting that the negative charge on theN-oxides is not only not required for activating hM3Dq, but also reduces agonist potency. The quaternary ammonium salt6was an extremely potent full agonist of hM3Dq with an EC50value of 69 pM and about 15-fold more potent than compound4a(clozapine). However, compound6was also a potent full agonist of hM3 (EC50= 9.5 nM,Emax= 92) even though it achieves greater than 100-fold higher potency for hM3Dq over hM3. Taken together, these results suggest that either a basic amino group as in compounds4aand4bor a group with permanent positive charge as in compounds5aand6is required to retain hM3Dq agonist activity. In addition, compound9that contains a hydantoin moiety and compound10that contains an amino acid moiety in this region did not activate hM3Dq and hM3. On the other hand, compound11, which is the des-methyl clozapine, showed similar potency and efficacy for hM3Dq and hM3 as clozapine, suggesting that theN-methyl group is not required for activating hM3Dq. Interestingly, compound13, which is a deuterated analogue of compound4b, exhibited similar potency and efficacy (EC50= 9.6 nM,Emax= 86%) for hM3Dq as compounds4band5a(CNO) (Figure2). None,NoneCompounds13and21are potent hM3Dq agonists and do not activate hM3 being similar to compound5a(CNO). We were also pleased to find that the 8-chloro group was not required to maintain high agonist potency and efficacy for hM3Dq. In particular, compound21was a potent full agonist (EC50= 1.7 nM,Emax= 100%) of hM3Dq (Figure2). Because compound4a(clozapine) showed high binding affinities to 5HT2Aand 5HT2Cserotonin, alpha1Aadrenergic, and H1histamine receptors withKivalues of 5.4, 9.4, 1.6, and 1.1 nM, respectively (Table2), we tested compounds4b,4c,5b,5c,13, and21in 5HT2A, 5HT2C, alpha1A, and H1radioligand binding assays. We were pleased to find that compound21displayed much improved selectivity compared with compound4a(clozapine). Although it was only 3.5-fold selective for hM3Dq over H1, the overall selectivity profile of compound21is significantly better than compound4a(clozapine). Lastly, to identify an alternative compound that might activate hM3Dq, we conducted a screen of the commercially available Library Of Pharmaceutically Active Compounds (LOPAC;N= 1280 compounds) and Prestwick Chemical Library (N= 1280 compounds) using the hM3Dq FLIPR assay. Importantly, perlapine was greater than 10 000-fold selective for hM3Dq over hM3. In summary, we conducted the first SAR studies for hM3Dq, a chemogenetic platform for activating neuronal firing, by the design, synthesis, and pharmacological evaluation of new CNO analogues. We explored multiple regions of the CNO scaffold and observed the following interesting SAR trends: (1) a longer or bulkierN-alkyl group as in compounds4c,4d,5c, and5dreduces both potency and efficacy for hM3Dq; (2) a basic amino group as in compounds4aand4bor a permanent positive charge group as in compounds5aand6is required to retain hM3Dq agonist activity; (3) the negative change on theN-oxides such as5a-5dreduces hM3Dq agonist potency; (4) the 8-chloro group is not required to maintain high agonist potency and efficacy for hM3Dq; and (5) modifications to the benzodiazepine tricyclic core of CNO is tolerated. From these SAR studies, we discovered several compounds such as13and21, which are very potent full agonists of hM3Dq but do not activate the native human M3 receptor (hM3). Furthermore, we discovered perlapine as a novel, potent hM3Dq agonist, which is greater than 10 000-fold selective for hM3Dq over hM3.
