Accurate determination of cellular chromosome complements is a highly relevant issue beyond prenatal/pre-implantation genetic analyses or stem cell research, because aneusomy may be an important mechanism by which organisms control the rate of fetal cellular proliferation and the fate of regenerating tissues. Typically, small amounts of individual cells or nuclei are assayed by in situ hybridization using chromosome-specific DNA probes. Careful probe selection is fundamental to successful hybridization experiments. Numerous DNA probes for chromosome enumeration studies are commercially available, but their use in multiplexed hybridization assays is hampered due to differing probe-specific hybridization conditions or a lack of a sufficiently large number of different reporter molecules. Progress in the International Human Genome Project has equipped the scientific community with a wealth of unique resources, among them recombinant DNA libraries, physical maps, and data-mining tools. Here, we demonstrate how bioinformatics tools can become an integral part of simple, yet powerful approaches to devise diagnostic strategies for detection of aneuploidy in interphase cells. Our strategy involving initial in silico optimization steps offers remarkable savings in time and costs during probe generation, while at the same time significantly increasing the assay's specificity, sensitivity, and reproducibility.
