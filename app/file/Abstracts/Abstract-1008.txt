Since January 2008, obese women with type 2 diabetes were advised to gain 0-5 kg during pregnancy. The aim with this study was to evaluate fetal growth and perinatal morbidity in relation to gestational weight gain in these women. A retrospective cohort comprised the records of 58 singleton pregnancies in obese women (BMI greater than =30 kg/mSeventeen women (29%) gained =5 kg, and the remaining 41 gained 5 kg. The median (range) gestational weight gains were 3.7 kg (-4.7 to 5 kg) and 12.1 kg (5.5-25.5 kg), respectively. Prepregnancy BMI was 33.5 kg/mIn this pilot study in obese women with type 2 diabetes, maternal gestational weight gain less than =5 kg was associated with a more proportionate birth weight and less perinatal morbidity.
