Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) is now widely used as a standard imaging sequence for evaluation of the liver. The technique is easy to implement across different MRI platforms, and results in enhanced disease detection and characterization. With careful implementation, the quantitative apparent diffusion coefficient derived shows good measurement reproducibility, which can be applied for tissue characterization, the assessment of tumour response and disease prognostication. There is now a body of evidence that highlights the relative strengths and limitations of the technique for the assessment of liver diseases. The potential for more sophisticated analysis of DW-MRI data is currently being widely investigated.
