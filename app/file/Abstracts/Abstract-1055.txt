The aim of the study was to determine whether impaired fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and type 2 diabetes may be risk factors for sudden cardiac death (SCD). This prospective study was based on 2,641 middle-aged men 42-60 years of age at baseline. Impaired FPG level ( greater than =5.6 mmol/L) among nondiabetic subjects (501 men) was defined according to the established guidelines, and the group with type 2 diabetes included subjects (159 men) who were treated with oral hypoglycemic agents, insulin therapy, and/or diet. During the 19-year follow-up, a total of 190 SCDs occurred. The relative risk (RR) for SCD was 1.51-fold (95% CI 1.07-2.14,Impaired FPG and type 2 diabetes represent risk factors for SCD.
