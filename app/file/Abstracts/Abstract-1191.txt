The scaphoid is the most commonly fractured bone in the wrist and can often be difficult to treat and manage, making healing of this fracture problematic. A search of the entire PubMed (MEDLINE) database using the termsWrist fractures most commonly occur in the scaphoid, which is implicated approximately 60% of the time. The most common mechanism of injury leading to a scaphoid fracture is a fall on an outstretched hand (FOOSH), causing a hyperextension force on the wrist. The following 2 cases, which occurred within 3 months of each other, highlight the difficulty of managing patients with possible scaphoid fractures. Neither patient had a typical FOOSH-related mechanism of injury, and neither was initially tender over the scaphoid. Differential diagnoses should include a scaphoid fracture with any hyperextension traumatic injury (FOOSH or non-FOOSH), even in the absence of scaphoid tenderness and when initial radiographic findings are normal.
