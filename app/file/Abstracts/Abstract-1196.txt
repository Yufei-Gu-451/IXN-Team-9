Isolated traumatic subscapularis tendon tears are uncommon at any age. In adolescent patients, this type of injury is even more infrequent and usually presents as a bony avulsion of the lesser tuberosity. This report reviews a case of an adolescent American football player sustaining a posterior impact to an abducted, extended arm that resulted in an isolated subscapularis tendon tear. Magnetic resonance imaging of the shoulder revealed an isolated subscapularis tear retracted 1.6 cm without bony avulsion from the lesser tuberosity. Surgical repair was performed with 2 biocomposite absorbable anchors in the lesser tuberosity. The patient returned to basketball 12 weeks after surgery. This case illustrates that a high index of suspicion is required for an appropriate diagnosis in young athletes.
