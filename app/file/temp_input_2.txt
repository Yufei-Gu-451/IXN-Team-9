The functional experiments demonstrated that the truncating mutations code for hyper-stable WIP1 protein, which induces strong dephosphorylation of Ser15 of p53 and impairs the p53-dependent G1 checkpoint (KleiblovaNone, 2013).
However, a paper published earlier demonstrated that the truncating mutations ofPPM1Dfound in blood cells of breast or ovarian cancer patients may result from sequence alterations formed during individual development as a mosaic mutations.
We decided to find out whether truncating mutations ofPPM1Dare present in blood DNA samples from lung cancer patients.
We selected promoters fromBAXandMDM2genes, which in our experimental system, are activated 15- and 200-fold, respectively, by p53 expressed from the co-transfected vector in NCI-H1299 cells (Figure 5).
Another study reported 1.5% of ovarian cancer cases with truncating mutations ofPPM1D(AkbariNone, 2014).
Our observations apparently contrasts with the data published by others (KleiblovaNone2013) who showed that knockdown of WIP1 (either its mutant or wild-type form) promotes the expression of p21-the product of p53 target gene.
We have also noticed in our previous experiments that downregulation of WIP1 with shRNA in U-2 OS cells promotes the expression of p21 in untreated cells (ZajkowiczNone, 2013).
