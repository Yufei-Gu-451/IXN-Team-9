Recent studies have shown that impaired mitochondrial function in the skeletal muscle may be involved in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance (5-7). These reports raise the possibility that systemic oxidative stress may contribute to lower aerobic capacity and skeletal muscle dysfunction in patients with MetS. Peripheral blood samples were collected after 10 h of fasting. Moreover, the degree of PCr change (i.e., PCr loss) during exercise was calculated as PCr loss = standardized PCrrest- standardized PCrpeak, in which PCrrestindicates the PCr level at rest, and PCrpeakindicates the lowest PCr level during exercise. Skeletal muscle energy metabolismIMCL content was higher in patients with MetS than control subjects (Table 2). Serum TBARS were significantly increased in patients with MetS (Fig. Systemic oxidative stress and peakVO2(A), systemic oxidative stress and AT (B), systemic oxidative stress and muscle PCr loss (C), and systemic oxidative stress and IMCL content (D). Therefore, we established a new association between systemic oxidative stress and aerobic capacity in patients with MetS. The impairment of mitochondrial function in the skeletal muscle results in further production of ROS (4,28), which might, at least in part, contribute to the enhanced systemic oxidative stress in patients with MetS. Recent large clinical trials have demonstrated that systemic oxidative stress is related to insulin resistance and obesity (15,16), which is consistent with our results that there were tight correlations between serum TBARS and insulin resistance markers such as FBS, insulin level, or free fatty acid level (Supplementary Fig.
