Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is initiated years before clinical onset and continues until nearly all insulin-producing cells have been destroyed by autoimmune processes (1). It is estimated that at presentation 10-30% of beta-cells remain and that beta-cell death continues over the next 3-5 years until the majority of patients lose clinically significant levels of insulin production (2). It has heretofore not been possible to directly measure beta-cell destruction in patients. The measurements that are used actually measure beta-cell function: they do not gauge the pathologic process and can be affected by metabolic factors such as ambient glucose levels. Moreover, newer immune therapies, such as FcR nonbinding anti-CD3 (teplizumab) and anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (rituximab) or CTLA4Ig (abatacept), have been shown to decrease the rate of decline in beta-cell function, but owing to the lack of a more direct measure of beta-cell destruction, their effects on the primary cause of the disease have not been assessed (3-8).
