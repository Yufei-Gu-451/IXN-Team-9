Elevated rates of depression among people with diabetes (1) may partly account for their higher rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality (2). Depression is associated with adverse CVD outcomes (3,4), likely via behavioral mechanisms (e.g., effects of cigarette smoking, and sedentary lifestyle and poor diet leading to obesity) and physiological mechanisms (e.g., effects of elevated blood glucose, blood pressure, and lipid levels, as well as dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis). Behavioral mechanisms may activate physiological mechanisms. Literature suggests that antidepressant medicines (ADMs) may also affect CVD risk factors and outcomes either negatively or positively. Some ADMs, such as tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), may increase the risk of myocardial infarction (5). Findings on the association between other widely used ADMs, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-noradrenaline (norepinephrine) reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and cardiovascular outcomes are mixed.
