Fundamental to development of type 2 diabetes is failure of beta-cells to secrete adequate amounts of insulin in order to maintain blood glucose levels within the normal range (1). A common feature of type 2 diabetes is obesity and concomitantly elevated free fatty acid (FFA) levels (2). It has long been recognized that elevated FFAs have differential effects on insulin secretion depending on duration of exposure; acute exposure leads to increased insulin secretion (3,4), while chronic exposure impairs insulin secretion and results in beta-cell death (5,6). Chronically elevated FFAs induce defects at multiple steps in the pathways governing insulin production and secretion. As palmitate is a predominant fatty acid in human plasma and is increased in obese individuals (7), its use in studies of beta-cell function has relevance for human disease. Studies have shown that palmitate inhibits glucose-induced insulin promoter activity leading to suppression of insulin gene expression (8). Key enzymes in glucose and lipid metabolism are also dysregulated by palmitate exposure (9), leading to mitochondrial defects such as reduced ATP production (10) and induction of oxidative/nitrative stress (11,12). In addition, dysregulated calcium homeostasis (13,14) and solubleN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complex assembly and/or expression (15,16) due to chronic FFAs have been reported. Thus, while numerous FFA-induced beta-cell defects have been demonstrated, the critical cellular mediators that contribute to reduced insulin secretion remain incompletely defined. Neprilysin is a widely expressed plasma membrane protein that in nonislet tissues (e.g., mesenteric fat, endothelium) is upregulated under conditions of elevated FFAs and has been postulated to mediate cellular dysfunction in type 2 diabetes (17-19).
