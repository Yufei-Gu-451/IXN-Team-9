In 2010, diabetes was diagnosed in ?25.6 million adults in the United States (prevalence 11.3%) (1). Overall obesity as reflected by an increased BMI is a well-recognized risk factor for type 2 diabetes (2), and weight control is an effective strategy in the prevention of diabetes (3). Body shape or increased central obesity has also emerged as an important determinant of diabetes. In fact, abdominal obesity as reflected by an increased waist circumference (WC) has been shown to predict risk of diabetes beyond that of overall obesity (4). Due to increases in the prevalence of overall and abdominal obesity in the United States over the last three decades, younger individuals are experiencing a greater cumulative exposure to excess adiposity over their lifetime (5-7). However, few studies have determined the impact of this chronic, long-term obesity on diabetes rates.
