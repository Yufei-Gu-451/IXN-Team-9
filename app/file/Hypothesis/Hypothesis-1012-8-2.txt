The aim of the current study was therefore to develop and validate an algorithm that separately calculates each risk of the first occurrence for five events: fatal and nonfatal CHD, fatal and nonfatal stroke, noncardiovascular mortality, overt nephropathy, and progression of retinopathy. Design of the JDCS and the J-EDIT has been described in detail elsewhere (26,27). Discrimination, the ability to distinguish between those who experienced the event and those who did not, was evaluated using Harrell C statistics, the proportion of all patient pairs in which the predictions of the model and observed events were concordant. Of the 1,297 patients without retinopathy at baseline, 415 (32.0%) developed retinopathy. The backward variable selection procedure identified 11 baseline risk factors for macro- and microvascular complications and noncardiovascular mortality. In contrast, only 101 of the 376 cases (26.9%) who developed any of the events had a macrovascular risk of 10% or more based on the JJ risk engine, yielding sensitivity of 26.9% and specificity of 89.1%. The SBP of one patient is 120 mmHg. His leading risks are macrovascular diseases (16.1% for CHD and 17.6% for stroke), and his microvascular risks are moderate (7.8% for nephropathy and 13.6% for retinopathy). Donnan et al. The risk equation from the Swedish National Diabetes Register incorporates the use of antihypertensive drugs and lipid-lowering drugs as predictors (9). In contrast to CHD, the C statistic of the JJ risk engine (0.636) was similar to the UKPDS risk engine (0.638) and lower than the risk equation of the HKDR (0.749) (17). With regard to lifestyle factors, we identified LTPA as a risk factor for stroke and noncardiovascular mortality, although the statistical significance was borderline. It is notable that these events are not inherently independent and the JJ risk engine calculates each probability of the first occurrence for five events.
