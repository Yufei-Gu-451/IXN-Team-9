Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is mainly characterized by insulin resistance and obesity, which increases not only the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases but also all-cause mortality (1). The drastic increase in patients with MetS has been now recognized as a medical and public health crisis in the world. Lower aerobic capacity is one of the strongest and independent predictors of all-cause mortality in subjects with obesity and insulin resistance (2,3), and it is essential to improve lower aerobic capacity in the treatment of MetS. Skeletal muscle energy metabolism is a major determinant of aerobic capacity, and its metabolic regulation is largely dependent on mitochondrial function, which plays a pivotal role in energy homeostasis, including the metabolism of nutrients and production of ATP (4). Recent studies have shown that impaired mitochondrial function in the skeletal muscle may be involved in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance (5-7).
