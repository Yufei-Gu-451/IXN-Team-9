Several linkage studies and meta-analyses support a broad region on chromosome 13q32-q34 as genetically linked and associated with schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BD) (1-4). Chumakovet al. interrogated a 5 Mb region on 13q33 and identified a 65 Kb region that harbored significant SZ association signals in two sample sets (5). Within the associated region, a pair of sense and anti-sense genes, G72 and G30, were identified by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) (5). This region's association with SZ and BD has been replicated in multiple studies, although negative results exist as well (6-9). Our meta-analysis supported the association with SZ in Chinese samples but not in Europeans (10). The G72/G30 gene complex is regarded as an important candidate for SZ (11;12), BD (13;14), or both (11;15-18). G72 genotypes have also been associated with brain function in humans during verbal fluency tests (19;20), and with brain structure changes in bipolar patients (21). No gene homologous to G72 has been found in any non-primate species, including mouse (5). Furthermore, no conserved functional domains are found in any predicted G72 protein sequences.
