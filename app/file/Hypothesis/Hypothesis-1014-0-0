Between 6 and 9% of North American adults have diabetes (1-3) and are at risk for diabetes-related complications, including both macro- and microvascular disease. Compared with adults without diabetes, adults with diabetes are three times as likely to be hospitalized with cardiovascular disease and six times as likely to be hospitalized with chronic kidney disease (1). The economic burden of diabetes was estimated to be $12.2 billion (Canadian dollars [CDN]) in 2010 (4). In one province in Canada, where only 3.6% of the population had diabetes, medical costs for this group accounted for 15% of total health care spending (5). Patients with diabetes who have complications incur higher costs (4-8) and an estimated one-third of the direct medical cost of diabetes can be attributed to the management of complications (5). Cardiovascular illnesses account for the majority of this spending.
