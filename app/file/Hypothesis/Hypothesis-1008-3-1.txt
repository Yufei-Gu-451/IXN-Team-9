Obesity is a common characteristic of pregnant women with type 2 diabetes. The inclusion criteria were as follows: type 2 diabetes, defined as diabetes diagnosed before pregnancy where the initial management was diet or oral antidiabetic drugs; referral before 22 gestational weeks with a singleton pregnancy; prepregnancy BMI greater than =30 kg/m2; and no concurrent diseases that could affect weight gain. Self-monitoring of plasma glucose was recommended six to seven times daily. Women gaining less than =5 kg had a lower median prepregnancy BMI and higher median diastolic blood pressure at first visit compared with the remaining women (Table 1). Pregnancy-related outcomesIn the multiple linear regression analysis, a gestational weight gain of less than =5 kg was significantly associated with a lower birth weightzscore when adjusted for prepregnancy BMI, smoking, HbA1cat last visit, ethnicity, preeclampsia, and nulliparity, (beta = -0.978 [95% CI -1.831 to -0.126],P= 0.025), corresponding to a one SD lower birth weight. Potentially positive effects of weight restriction as well as potentially negative effects were considered. At their first pregnancy visit, all women received education about the increased risk of complications in pregnancies with diabetes and were motivated toward a healthy lifestyle. We did not find an increased rate of SGA infants among women gaining less than =5 kg, and all these women received insulin treatment. In conclusion, we found that in obese women with type 2 diabetes, maternal gestational weight gain less than =5 kg was associated with a more proportionate birth weight and less perinatal morbidity without increased risk of SGA infants.
