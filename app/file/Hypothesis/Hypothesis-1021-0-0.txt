Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DN) is a frequent complication of diabetes mellitus (DM) affecting 30-50% of patients with type 2 DM (T2DM) (1). DN manifests as a length-dependent polyneuropathy, and as such, patients typically present with sensory symptoms such as pain, paraesthesia, and numbness in distal lower limb segments, which may progress to motor and upper limb involvement in more severe cases (2). It is well established that quality of life (QoL) is significantly impaired in DN patients, affecting physical, social, and emotional well-being (3,4). Currently, treatment options for the neuropathic symptoms of DN include anticonvulsant medications that have effects on voltage-gated ion channels, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mimetic agents, and selective noradrenaline- and serotonin-reuptake inhibitors. These medications either block sodium (Na+) channels or alter the balance between inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitters, reducing peripheral and central sensitization (5,6). At present, the selection of a specific drug for an individual patient is largely undertaken on a trial-and-error basis (7,8), frequently leading to prolonged trials of medication, development of significant side effects, and greater health care costs (8,9). Previously, human studies have demonstrated that ectopic sensory symptoms such as paraesthesia and pain may be related to changes in axonal ion channel properties (10).
