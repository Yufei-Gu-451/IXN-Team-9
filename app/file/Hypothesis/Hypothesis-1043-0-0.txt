Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a clinicopathological diagnosis in which greater than 5% of hepatocytes demonstrate macrovesicular steatosis in an individual without significant history of alcohol intake (1). NAFLD encompasses a range of disease severity spanning from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which in turn can progress to cirrhosis (1). Paralleling the worldwide epidemic of childhood obesity, NAFLD has become the most common cause of liver disease in pediatrics (2). Furthermore, it is now clear that it represents not only a risk for liver failure and liver carcinoma but also a strong cardiovascular risk factor closely related to insulin resistance. In particular, recent studies in obese children and adolescents demonstrated that the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and prediabetes increases with the increase in hepatic fat content (3), that subjects showing hepatic steatosis have a pronounced dyslipidemic profile characterized by high levels of large VLDL, small dense LDL, and decreased large HDL concentrations (4), and that fatty liver, independent of visceral and intramyocellular lipid content, plays a central role in the impairment of liver, muscle, and adipose insulin sensitivity (5). Ethnic differences in the prevalence of NAFLD have been pointed out in a landmark article by Browning et al. in 2004 (6). In that study, the authors observed that there is a clear difference in hepatic steatosis prevalence across ethnicities, with African Americans showing the lowest rate, Hispanics showing the highest rate, and Caucasians having a rate in the middle (6).
