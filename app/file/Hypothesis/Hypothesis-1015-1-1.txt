The number of transplant recipients developing NODAT is rising as the rate of ESRD and kidney transplantation increases. There is a five- to sixfold higher incidence of new-onset of diabetes mellitus among transplant recipients during the first year after transplantation than among patients who remain on the transplant waiting list, with a decline after the first year to an annual incidence of 4-6% (3) (Fig. If so, then NODAT results from risk factors similar to those for type 2 diabetes mellitus that are enhanced by transplantation among patients with seemingly normal glucose homeostasis before transplant. Results of several previous studies suggest that insulin resistance contributes to the development of diabetes after kidney transplant (24). Several compelling lines of evidence support the idea that lifestyle intervention, specifically tailored to patients with CKD or ESRD and delivered before and immediately after transplantation, might lower the incidence of NODAT. Thus, a lifestyle intervention aimed at lowering fat mass may be appropriate for the prevention of NODAT. The timing of a weight loss intervention remains uncertain. Thus, an intervention aimed at increasing muscle mass while decreasing fat mass before transplantation may decrease the incidence of NODAT and some complications, including wound infections and development of delayed graft function (50), and may confer improved allograft and patient survival (51); however, clinical trials are needed to test this hypothesis. Previous studies have reported a high incidence of de novo hyperglycemia immediately after transplant (14,15). Although lifestyle intervention may have rare adverse effects, the evidence supporting successful prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus strongly suggests that similar interventions should be tried in the kidney transplant population.
