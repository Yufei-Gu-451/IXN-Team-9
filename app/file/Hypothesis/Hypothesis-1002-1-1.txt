The purpose of this analysis was to determine whether there are significant differences in presentation, clinicopathologic features, treatment, and survival rates between non-Hispanic white (NHW) and Asian; and between Asian subgroups in patients with CRC. Lifestyle differences may also explain some of differences in CRC survival. Second, the lifestyle and screening data were obtained only from California and included only five Asian subgroups, which may not represent the status of entire United States.
