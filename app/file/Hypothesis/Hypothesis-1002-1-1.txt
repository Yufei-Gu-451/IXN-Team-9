Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common malignancy and the third most frequent cause of cancer death in the United States for overall population, although both incidence and mortality rates have declined in recent years (CressNone, 2006). The CRC screening proportions in all Asian subgroups were lower than in NHW. Higher income was associated with better DSS only in NHW and Hawaiian.
