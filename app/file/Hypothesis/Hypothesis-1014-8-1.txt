Approximately 90% of prevalent diabetes cases are type 2 diabetes (1); therefore, all cost estimates based on this cohort are heavily weighted toward type 2 diabetes. All costs are reported in 2010 CDN dollars. Among patients less than 65 years of age, those with unmeasured HbA1cwere less likely to have comorbid illness, possibly suggesting that some of the unmeasured patients were misclassified. Medications accounted for $10,000 or approximately one-quarter of the 5-year medical costs for people greater than 65 years of age; the mean cumulative 5-year cost for this group, including drug costs, was CDN $44,511 (IQR $13,758-56,333) per patient. Mean total 5-year unadjusted costs per patient with diabetes, overall and by subgroupThe cost of managing patients with diabetes, stratified by category of glycemic controlAfter stratification by kidney function, the adjusted cost of caring for patients with diabetes varied from $25,316 (for patients with eGFR 90 mL/min) to $115,348 (for patients not on dialysis with eGFR 15 mL/min) (Fig. 1). Patients who had no proteinuria had an adjusted mean cost of $24,531 per patient compared with $46,836 for patients with heavy proteinuria. Costs were also positively associated with age, Aboriginal status, lower socioeconomic status, duration of diabetes, and Charlson comorbidity index. This represents ?12.5% of total health care spending in Canada, which was estimated at $200 billion annually in 2011 (29). Although this study does not provide direct evidence that improvements in diabetes management would lead to cost reductions, our findings demonstrate a clear association between increased cost and suboptimal glycemic control and markers of kidney disease. Wagner et al. We did not adjust for medication use since this information was not available for the entire cohort, nor were we able to adjust for unknown factors, such as mild diabetes, misclassification, and more specific socioeconomic characteristics. Economic evaluations alongside controlled intervention studies are needed to draw definitive conclusions.
