However, with unresectable disease, other types of therapy are usually needed, such as anti-hypertensive treatment with pharmacologic agents or inhibitors of catecholamine excess and radiotherapy to palliate painful bone metastases or radiometabolic treatment[None]. For statistical analysis, we used the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for pairwise comparison and the Pearson coefficient of correlation. APvalue less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Another limitation is that pathologic data were not available to compare with the changes evident on MIBG imaging. Furthermore, CT and MR studies were not available in all patients for systematic comparison with the MIBG findings.
