We previously demonstrated that qualitative analysis using MIBG imaging allows lesion-by-lesion evaluation of the heterogeneity of neuroblastoma response to chemotherapy[None]. In 2 others, the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma was made by biopsy (Table 1). In all patients, the malignant pheochromocytoma was located in non-chromaffin tissue. After chemotherapy, the same diagnostic approach might be used to evaluate both primary and metastatic disease[None,None,None]. First, the overall MIBG results were consistent with the biochemical response of tumor.
