The primary outcome was 5-year cumulative health care costs for the entire cohort. Baseline characteristics for the cohortLaboratory measurements were available for the majority of the cohort: 73% for HbA1c, 66% for proteinuria, and 84% for eGFR. Excluding drug costs, patients greater than 65 years of age had consistently higher costs. Adjusted mean cost per patient, stratified by laboratory measure of relevance to patients with diabetes. In addition to the laboratory parameters described above, worsening socioeconomic status, Aboriginal status, and increasing Charlson index score were associated with increased 5-year costs. Costs increased less dramatically as glycemic control worsened; patients with inadequate glycemic control ($32,629 for patients with HbA1c greater than 9%) had 20% higher costs compared with patients with good control ($27,064 for HbA1c less than 7%). This represents ?12.5% of total health care spending in Canada, which was estimated at $200 billion annually in 2011 (29). Although this study does not provide direct evidence that improvements in diabetes management would lead to cost reductions, our findings demonstrate a clear association between increased cost and suboptimal glycemic control and markers of kidney disease. In addition, although we found a strong association between glycemic control, proteinuria, and kidney function and costs, it is unknown whether improved management would in fact lead to a decrease in health care costs. After controlling for clinical and demographic factors, we found that the cost of caring for people with diabetes increased with suboptimal glycemic control, proteinuria, and worsening kidney function.
