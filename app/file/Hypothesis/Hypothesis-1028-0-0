The incidence of type 2 diabetes is increasing worldwide at an alarming rate (1). Although healthy diet, weight control, and physical activity remain the core of diabetes prevention and treatment (2,3), emerging modifiable risk factors are attracting more attention. Recent studies suggested that hypovitaminosis D could be a risk factor for the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes (4-10). In a prospective study, Mattila et al. (11) found an inverse association between serum 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25-OHD) levels and the risk of incident type 2 diabetes; however, this association became nonsignificant after adjustment for confounders. Kayaniyil et al. (12) did find, however, that low serum 25-OHD was a risk factor for the metabolic syndrome, a risk that remained significant after adjustment for confounders.
