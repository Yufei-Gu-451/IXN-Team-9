In fact, in the U.S., the prevalence of obesity (BMI greater than =30 kg/m2) among transplant recipients at the time of kidney transplantation doubled between 1987 and 2001 (13). 1). Incidence of new-onset diabetes mellitus before and after transplant. **Statistics from refs. Figure 2describes the pathogenesis of NODAT. The diabetogenic effect of glucocorticoids results primarily from insulin resistance, followed by enhanced gluconeogenesis in the liver as well as decreased glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis in skeletal muscle cells. Robust studies of the effects of calcineurin inhibition on beta-cell survival, insulin resistance, or both merit further investigation in human subjects. As occurs in type 2 diabetes mellitus, both an increase in peripheral insulin resistance and an impairment in insulin response or secretion have been implicated in tipping patients toward the development of NODAT. Patients with CKD self-report low levels of physical activity (52), and in-center hemodialysis, three times per week for 3-4 h per treatment, strongly promotes inactivity. The normoglycemic goal was 110-120 mg/dL.
