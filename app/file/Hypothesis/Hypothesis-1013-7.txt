Accordingly, our aim was to determine ifl-arginine, which is the substrate for NO synthase, would reverse sex-dependent renal hemodynamic and blood pressure differences in the response to clamped hyperglycemia in patients with uncomplicated type 1 DM. After the desired level of ambient glycemia was maintained for 6 h, a third intravenous line was inserted into the right arm and was connected to a syringe infusion pump for administration of inulin and PAH. 1). Furthermore, consistent with our previous work performed during clamped euglycemia (13), predominant declines in ERPF and RBF compared with effects on GFR suggest thatl-NMMA infusion during clamped hyperglycemia also exerts a dominant preglomerular effect. Our data therefore suggest that women exhibit enhanced NO bioactivity in the postglomerular circulation at baseline during clamped euglycemia; clamped hyperglycemia alone quenches postglomerular NO, leading to an increase in GFR and FF with lesser effects on ERPF, and these effects are reversible with infusion ofl-arginine. Our findings therefore show that although baseline euglycemic NO bioactivity was higher in women, a small reduction in NO bioactivity with clamped hyperglycemia was associated with exaggerated hypertensive responses that were not influenced byl-arginine.
