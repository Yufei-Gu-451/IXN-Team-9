We previously demonstrated that qualitative analysis using MIBG imaging allows lesion-by-lesion evaluation of the heterogeneity of neuroblastoma response to chemotherapy[None]. In 2 others, the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma was made by biopsy (Table 1). In all patients, the malignant pheochromocytoma was located in non-chromaffin tissue. First, the overall MIBG results were consistent with the biochemical response of tumor. Another limitation is that pathologic data were not available to compare with the changes evident on MIBG imaging.
