Prepare the following solutions (seeTable 1for compositions): (a) 1 liter NFR (Normal Frog Ringer), (b) 100 ml 10% saline, (c) 100 ml CMF (Ca2+/Mg2+-free solution), (d) 1 ml ITS (Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium, Sigma I1884), (e) 100 ml L-15 culture medium, (f) 10 ml HCG (human chorionic gonadotropin Sigma CG-10), (g) 100 ml K+-internal solution, (h) 100 ml K+-internal solution for Amphotericin B. The osmotic strength of solution 1 should be checked to ensure that it is approximately 260 mOsM using a vapor pressure osmometer (e.g. Wescor model #5100C). Filter sterilize solutions (b) and (c). Solutions (a) (b) and (c) can be stored up to three months at 4 degrees C. Prepare solution (d) by adding 1 ml deionized H2O to the vial containing the lyophilized powder via a 25 gauge syringe needle and syringe filter.
