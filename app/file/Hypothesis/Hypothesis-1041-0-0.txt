Low vitamin D status is prevalent in many populations and has become a common public health problem worldwide (1,2). Vitamin D is well-known for its essential role in calcium homeostasis and bone health (2). Emerging evidence from both in vitro and in vivo studies has suggested extraskeletal effects of vitamin D, including on insulin action and secretion (2,3). Population studies have provided further support to the hypothesis that low vitamin D status, as assessed by circulating 25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)D] levels, is associated with impaired beta-cell function, insulin resistance, and impaired glucose intolerance and thereby may be associated with higher risk of type 2 diabetes (4-7). An inverse association between 25(OH)D levels and prevalent type 2 diabetes has been shown (4,8-10); however, a temporal relationship cannot be established from such cross-sectional studies that are subject to bias due to the possibility of reverse causation. Recently, several prospective observational studies have reported a significant association between high circulating levels of 25(OH)D and lower incidence of type 2 diabetes (11-17).
