Diabetes is one of the fastest-growing public health problems in the world. Its prevalence is particularly advancing in Asia-Pacific regions, where more than half of diabetes patients reside and where nearly half of all deaths from cardiovascular disease (CVD) occur worldwide (1-4). Diabetes increases the risk of premature death in the general population. Some studies have reported that the effect of diabetes on death can be augmented by obesity (5,6), whereas other studies have reported that the association is augmented by leanness (7-9). These data, however, have been derived from Western populations, and thus little evidence is available about the effects of BMI on the associations between diabetes and all-cause death in Asians. Several distinctive features are apparent among the pathogenetic factors for diabetes and its complication in Asian populations compared with Western populations (2,3).
