Elevated levels of circulating advanced glycation end products (AGEs), a heterogeneous group of compounds formed by the nonezymatic glycation of proteins, lipids, or nucleic acids (1,2), are believed to play a major role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease in diabetes (3-5). Although AGEs are better known as products of hyperglycemia, they also form in food during heat-enhanced cooking (6). Dietary AGEs, representing an important source for circulating AGEs in vivo (7-9), are partially absorbed (10,11) and either retained in the body or eliminated into the urine (11-13). We have reported (14) that a single high-heat-processed, mixed meal with a high AGE content or the oral administration of an AGE-enriched cola beverage (15) induced acute impairment of arterial vasodilatation in response to ischemia, an early marker of endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis (16-18).
