Therapeutic inhibition of tumour angiogenesis and multiple signalling pathways associated with tumour development (e.g., pathways controlled by vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs) and platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs)) results in clinically meaningful antitumor activity, as demonstrated across multiple tumour types, including colon cancer, pancreatic carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma (RCC), breast cancer (BC) and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (HurwitzNone, 2005;SandlerNone, 2006;MillerNone, 2007;BursteinNone, 2008;ManegoldNone, 2008;EscudierNone, 2009). Sunitinib malate, an oral multitargeted inhibitor of VEGFRs, PDGFRs, stem cell factor receptor (KIT), and other RTKs (AbramsNone, 2003;MendelNone, 2003;O'FarrellNone, 2003a,2003b;FaivreNone, 2006), is approved for treatment of advanced RCC, imatinib-resistant gastrointestinal stromal tumour, and progressive, well-differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (DemetriNone, 2006;MotzerNone, 2006;MotzerNone, 2007;KulkeNone, 2008;RaymondNone, 2011;SUTENT (sunitinib malate) prescribing information (2012)). In phase I and II trials, sunitinib has also shown antitumor activity in patients with other advanced solid tumours, including BC, NSCLC, neuroendocrine tumour, sarcoma, thyroid cancer and melanoma (RosenNone, 2003;FaivreNone, 2006;BursteinNone, 2008;SocinskiNone, 2008). Gemcitabine is used (alone or in combination with other chemotherapies, such as cisplatin or carboplatin) across a broad spectrum of solid tumours, including locally advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, metastatic BC, advanced NSCLC, ovarian cancer, bladder cancer, and others (Gemzar (gemcitabine HCl) prescribing information (2010);Gemzar (gemcitabine HCI) product monograph (2006)). Targeting PDGF and VEGF signalling pathways with sunitinib plus gemcitabine may enhance antitumor activity compared with either agent alone. Extensive preclinical evidence suggests additive and/or synergistic effects in solid tumour models when a variety of chemotherapies, including gemcitabine, are combined with targeted agents, including sunitinib (YeeNone, 2004;CarterNone, 2007;ChristensenNone, 2008), as demonstrated in a recently reported phase I trial of sunitinib on a continuous daily dosing schedule plus gemcitabine in patients with advanced solid tumours (BrellNone, 2012). Patients were excluded if previously treated with gemcitabine or sunitinib; had severe/unstable angina, myocardial infarction, symptomatic congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular accident, or transient ischaemic attack within the previous 12 months; National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE, version 3.0) grade 3 haemorrhage within 4 weeks of study entry; uncontrolled hypertension; uncontrolled brain metastases; and a second malignancy diagnosis within the last 5 years. Planned dose-escalation schemes for sunitinib (both schedules) and gemcitabine are shown inTable 1. The initial cohorts were expanded to six patients if 1/3 patients experienced a DLT (as defined below) during cycle 1. Haematological DLTs were defined as grade 4 neutropenia for ?7 days; febrile neutropenia (fever greater than 38.5 degrees C for ?24 h); neutropenic infection (?grade 3 neutropenia with grade ?3 infection); grade ?4 thrombocytopenia, with bleeding or lasting ?7 days; or lymphopenia accompanied by related infection. Non-haematological DLTs were any drug-related grade 3 or 4 toxicities lasting ?7 days (except for grade 3/4 hyperamylasemia or hyperlipasemia without signs of pancreatitis, grade 4 hyperuricemia or grade 3/4 hypophosphatemia without clinical symptoms, or grade 3 asymptomatic hypertension), and nausea, vomiting, or diarrhoea persisting at grade 3 or 4 despite treatment. Blood samples for determination of full PK profiles for sunitinib and SU12662 were collected for patients receiving Schedule 4/2 on cycle 1, day 15 (sunitinib alone) and day 22 (sunitinib and gemcitabine), and for patients receiving Schedule 2/1 on cycle 1, day 8 (sunitinib and gemcitabine) and day 15 (sunitinib alone) at pre-dose and up to 25 h post-dose. In addition, blood samples for determination of trough levels of sunitinib and SU12662 were taken for Schedule 4/2 pre-dose on day 1 (cycles 1-3) and 24 h after the last dose (cycles 1-3 and 5), and for Schedule 2/1 were obtained before dosing on day 1 (cycles 1, 4, and 6), days 8 and 15 (cycle 1) and day 14 (cycles 4, 6, and 10). The most common treatment-emergent (all causality) non-haematological AEs (all schedules, all doses) were fatigue (75.0%), gastrointestinal disorders (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, constipation (each 45.5%)), and pyrexia (45.5%), the majority grade 1 or 2 in severity. On Schedule 2/1, pre-amendment, treatment-related non-haematological grade ?3 AEs for sunitinib 37.5 mg plus gemcitabine 750 mg m-2were nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, abscess, appendicitis, electrocardiogram QT-prolongation, hyperamylasemia (eachn=1), and hyperlipasemia (n=2). Non-haematological treatment-related AEs included: grade 4 uric acid elevation (n=2), hypertension, pulmonary embolism, and cerebrovascular accident (n=1 each), grade 3 elevation of amylase (n=2) or lipase (n=1), hypertension, pericardial effusion, leukoencephalopathy, nausea, mucosal inflammation, hypophosphatemia, and hypomagnesemia (eachn=1). We conducted a phase I dose-escalation study of sunitinib combined with gemcitabine in patients with advanced solid tumours. Schedule 4/2 was not pursued beyond the initial dose level of sunitinib 37.5 mg plus gemcitabine 750 mg m-2for practical reasons (i.e., because of missed or delayed doses of gemcitabine because of slow recovery from neutropenia). This safety profile is similar to that reported in phase I trials of sunitinib in combination with other chemotherapy regimens, including docetaxel, capecitabine, pemetrexed, carboplatin plus paclitaxel, and gemcitabine (with and without cisplatin), in which most AEs were mild to moderate in studies including patients with all solid tumours or those restricted to NSCLC (SweeneyNone, 2007;ChowNone, 2008;HeathNone, 2008;TraynorNone, 2008;ReckNone, 2010;BrellNone, 2012;OkamotoNone, 2012). For example, the incidences of the most common grade 3 or 4 haematological toxicities associated with this combination (Schedule 2/1, post-amendment) were substantially higher than that with sunitinib monotherapy (in treatment-naive patients with metastatic RCC;SUTENT (sunitinib malate) prescribing information (2012)): neutropenia (52%vs17%, respectively), leucopenia (32%vs8%), lymphopenia (28%vs18%) and thrombocytopenia (28%vs9%). There appeared to be no clinically relevant changes in the PK of sunitinib and total drug when sunitinib was administered with gemcitabine, which is consistent with the literature in which gemcitabine has not been reported to be a substrate or inhibitor/inductor of CYP3A4, the main CYP450 isoenzyme involved in the metabolism of sunitinib and its metabolite. In addition, co-administration of sunitinib with gemcitabine did not appear to affect the PK of gemcitabine. Sarcomatoid differentiation, found across all RCC histological subtypes (de Peralta-VenturinaNone, 2001), is thought to represent transformation of RCC to a higher grade (ChevilleNone, 2004;GolshayanNone, 2009), and is associated with a relatively poor prognosis and median overall survival of only ?3-10 months with non-targeted agents (e.g., immunotherapy;de Peralta-VenturinaNone, 2001;EscudierNone, 2002;MianNone, 2002;KwakNone, 2007). Although targeted therapies have yet to deliver significant advances in pancreatic cancer treatment (O'Reilly 2009), there are indications that combining EGFR-directed and/or antiangiogenic agents with gemcitabine may be beneficial (MooreNone, 2007;Van CutsemNone, 2009).
