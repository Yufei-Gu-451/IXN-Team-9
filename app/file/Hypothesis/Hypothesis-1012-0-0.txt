Risk classification for vascular complications is of particular importance in diabetes care, and there is a need for validated diabetes-specific risk engines (1,2). Asian populations account for greater than 60% of the world's diabetes patients (3,4), but data used for most of the engines specific to diabetes include only a limited number of Asians (5-9). Asian patients with diabetes have several important features. We previously reported that Japanese patients have a markedly low prevalence of obesity and low incidence rates of overt nephropathy and diabetic retinopathy (10-13). Furthermore, the risk factor profiles of diabetes complications are quite different between Japanese and Western subjects with diabetes (14). In cohort studies of multiple ethnic groups, lower incidence rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) were observed in Asian patients than in whites (15,16). Given the overestimation of risks of coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke in Chinese patients by the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) risk engine (17,18), risk engines for non-Asian populations may not be transportable to Asian patients.
