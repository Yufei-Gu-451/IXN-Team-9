Growing evidence suggests that the brain has a surprisingly potent capacity to normalize blood glucose levels in animals with uncontrolled insulin-deficient diabetes. Even at low doses, leptin infusion directly into the brain completely normalizes diabetic hyperglycemia despite persistent, severe insulin deficiency (1-4). Thus, glucose-lowering in this setting appears to involve mechanisms that are largely independent of either insulin secretion or insulin sensitivity, and identifying neurocircuits that underlie these effects has emerged as an important scientific priority. Neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMN) that express brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) are of interest with respect to brain mechanisms of glucose-lowering in diabetes. In addition to its well-established roles in the survival, differentiation, and plasticity of neurons (5), BDNF also is implicated in the regulation of energy homeostasis and glucose homeostasis through its effects in the central nervous system. Consistent with this, either systemic or central BDNF administration dose-dependently reduces food intake and body weight (6) in rodent models of both impaired (diet-induced obesity) and deficient (db/dbmice) leptin signaling (7,8).
