Diabetes is a chronic disease for which there is currently no cure. Patients with type 1 diabetes need insulin replacement therapy to survive, but glycemia is not always properly regulated. Chronic hyperglycemia leads to development of diabetes-associated microvascular, macrovascular, and neurologic complications, which can be delayed by intensive insulin therapy (1). However, this treatment is not suitable for all diabetic patients because of its high risk of hypoglycemia secondary to excessive insulin dosage (1). Thus, precise regulation of glucose homeostasis is a major challenge in diabetes management. Therapeutic benefit has been obtained with islet transplantation (2), but access to human islets and the necessary immunosuppressive therapy are important limitations. Alternative cell- and gene-based therapies, centered around the engineering of nonpancreatic tissues to produce insulin, or the generation of stem cell-derived beta cells, are undergoing investigation (3,4); however, long-term safety and efficacy data in large animal models are lacking. Genetic engineering of skeletal muscle to counteract hyperglycemia is an attractive strategy to correct diabetes. Skeletal muscle is responsible for the disposal of ?70% of circulating glucose after a meal. In muscle, glucose utilization is controlled by insulin-stimulated glucose transport through the glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) (5) and phosphorylation by hexokinase II, which has a lowKmfor glucose and is inhibited by glucose-6-phosphate, limiting glucose uptake (6). In diabetic muscle, because of the lack of insulin, GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane and hexokinase II activity both decrease. In contrast to hexokinase II, the liver enzyme glucokinase has a highKmfor glucose, is not inhibited by glucose-6-phosphate, and shows kinetic cooperation with glucose (7). When expressed in skeletal muscle of transgenic mice, glucokinase facilitates glucose uptake only when blood glucose is high (8).
