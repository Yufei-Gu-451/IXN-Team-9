Data were available from 3,942 subjects who completed the assessment of fitness at baseline and year 4, which represents 76.6% of the subjects recruited and randomized into the Look AHEAD Trial. Reasons for missing fitness data at year 4 are presented inFig. After 16 weeks, the meal replacements provided to participants were reduced to one shake and one snack bar per day. Because clinic site was the randomization stratification factor, it was adjusted in linear regression models. Model 2 regressed each potential mediator (changes in weight and fitness) against treatment group. The number of participants in the DSE group missing fitness is significantly higher than in the ILI group (P= 0.002). When data for only those subjects who completed the fitness test at year 4 were examined, there was a significant difference in weight change for ILI (-4.9% [95% CI -5.5 to -4.5%]) compared with DSE (-1.2% [-1.5 to -0.8%]). These analyses showed that the following baseline characteristics were associated with significantly greater improvements in fitness at year 4: lower BMI, younger age, male sex, race self-identified as white, not taking diabetes medication, not taking insulin, lower HbA1c, not having metabolic syndrome, and no prior history of CVD. These associations between change in weight and fitness remained statistically significant when data were analyzed separately for DSE and ILI (P less than 0.001). 3). Post hoc analysis showed that there was a significant difference for change in HbA1cbetween subjects grouped as having a greater than 10% increase in fitness and both subject groups as having a greater than 10% decline in fitness (P less than 0.0001) and a 0-10% decline in fitness (P less than 0.0001) at 4 years, with these comparisons remaining significant when data were analyzed separately for DSE and ILI. When change in fitness was treated as a continuous variable and with adjustment for selected covariates, there was a significant inverse association between HbA1cand change in fitness at 4 years (beta = -0.00431, SE = 0.00048,P less than 0.0001), and this was consistent when analyzed separately for DSE (beta = -0.0286, SE = 0.00130,P= 0.03) and ILI (beta = -0.00295, SE = 0.00106,P less than 0.0001). These findings have significant clinical implications and provide support for interventions to improve fitness in adults with T2DM. For example, the results of our mediation analysis showed that both weight loss and fitness change mediated the effect on change in HbA1c. This may have influenced the precise assessment of fitness in this study.
