Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is playing an increasing role in the assessment of patients with liver disease due to its high soft tissue resolution, lack of ionizing radiation and ability to provide functional data. Diffusion-weighted (DW)-MRI is a functional imaging technique that is now widely used as a standard imaging sequence, together with unenhanced T1/T2 weighted imaging and contrast-enhanced imaging for liver evaluation. As a non-contrast-enhanced technique, DW-MRI is particularly useful in patients with severe renal dysfunction at risk of developing nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) after administration of gadolinium-based contrast medium[None]. The clinical uses of liver DW-MRI include improved detection of focal liver lesions, contribution to tissue characterization for both diffuse disease and focal lesions, monitoring of tumour response after chemotherapy or radiotherapy, detection of recurrent disease, differentiating recurrence from post-therapeutic change, and potentially predicting treatment outcome. Knowledge of the evidence highlighting the strengths and limitations of the technique in these areas is important to maximize the advantages of using DW-MRI and to avoid the potential pitfalls. DW-MRI is a technique that explores the random, thermally driven, motion of water protons in the body, deriving image contrast on the basis of differences in water diffusivity within tissues. Water protons in the body exist in the intra- and extracellular spaces; free diffusion is modified by bulk capillary flow and the interactions of the protons with cell membranes and macromolecules. In this way, DW-MRI provides an insight into cellular architecture at the micrometre scale. In highly cellular tissues (e.g. tumour tissue), the tortuosity of the extracellular space and cell membrane density limit the apparent diffusion of water, which is said to be impeded[None,None].
