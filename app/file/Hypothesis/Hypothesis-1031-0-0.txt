Diabetes is one of the most common and fastest growing comorbidities of pregnancy, and its prevalence varies among United States racial/ethnic groups (1,2). Data on the prevalence of diabetes during pregnancy are needed at the state level, particularly for different population subgroups such as women aged 25 and older, racial/ethnic group, and socioeconomic status to help monitor disease trends, plan health care services, and develop effective health care practices and policies for prevention and control. However, state-specific data are limited on gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), defined as diabetes first diagnosed during pregnancy. Little information is available on state variation in GDM rates or on the variation among racial/ethnic groups by state. The influence of contextual factors, such as age, gender, and racial population composition, on use of health services has been identified (3).
