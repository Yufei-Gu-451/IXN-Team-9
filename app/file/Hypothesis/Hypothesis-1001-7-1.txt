Median days on sunitinib treatment were 92, 84, and 83-254 (depending on the dose level), respectively, and the median relative dose intensity for sunitinib was 58.4, 72.9, and 77.4-100% (67.8, 75.0, and 87.6-100% for gemcitabine). Laboratory abnormalities included grade 3 neutropenia (n=4), anaemia (n=1), and thrombocytopenia (n=1). Haematological AEs were neutropenia (grade 3 (n=1) and grade 4 (n=2)) and leucopenia (grade 3 (n=2)). Treatment-related AEs (grade ?3) occurring among the 25 patients on Schedule 2/1, post-amendment, are detailed inTable 3. For example, the incidences of the most common grade 3 or 4 haematological toxicities associated with this combination (Schedule 2/1, post-amendment) were substantially higher than that with sunitinib monotherapy (in treatment-naive patients with metastatic RCC;SUTENT (sunitinib malate) prescribing information (2012)): neutropenia (52%vs17%, respectively), leucopenia (32%vs8%), lymphopenia (28%vs18%) and thrombocytopenia (28%vs9%). Phase II studies of this combination in patients with RCC or pancreatic cancer are underway.
