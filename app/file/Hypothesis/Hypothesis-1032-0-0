Type 2 diabetes is characterized by both insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction (1). The insulin response to intravenous glucose, be it as a hyperglycemic clamp or a bolus injection, is composed of first and second phases (2,3). The acute or first-phase insulin response occurs between 0 and 10 min. However, the intravenous route of glucose administration is not as physiological as oral glucose. The latter results in release of incretins that enhance insulin secretion (4); thus, the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) might provide more physiological conditions for estimation of beta-cell function than does a test based on intravenous glucose administration. The insulin response during an OGTT is composed of early and late phases that are influenced by insulin sensitivity (5).
