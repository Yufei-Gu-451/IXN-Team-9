Sudden cardiac arrest accounts for one-half of all coronary heart disease (CHD)-related deaths, but there is limited information on the relationship between impaired fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels and the risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in the general population (1-4). Since a large majority of SCDs occur among the general segments of the population and most of these SCD cases occur outside the hospital with few or no early warning signs (1), the problem would require screening methods applicable to the general population. Therefore, there continues to be a great deal of interest in identifying clinically useful markers of SCD. One of the major challenges would be to prevent clinical conditions that may lead to SCD (5,6). Glucose intolerance and type 2 diabetes have been associated with an increased risk of atherosclerotic CHD (3,7). Some case-control studies have shown that type 2 diabetes was associated with the risk of SCD (3,8,9).
