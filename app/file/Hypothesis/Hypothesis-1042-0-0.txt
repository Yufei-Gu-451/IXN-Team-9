Patients with type 2 diabetes are at a high risk for the progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD), both of which are life-threatening complications (1). To improve prognosis in diabetic patients, it is clinically important to identify patients at high risk for these disorders as early as possible and to initiate disease management in a timely and appropriate manner. ESRD and CVD share a number of clinical features and risk factors that are important therapeutic targets. Microalbuminuria is well known to be a common risk factor of ESRD and CVD, and a reduction of urinary albumin excretion (UAE) via any intervention results in a reduced future incidence of these disorders (2,3). However, many patients still develop ESRD and CVD despite improvements in their outcome resulting from recent aggressive multifactorial management (4-6).
