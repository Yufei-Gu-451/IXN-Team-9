Information on the prevalence of selected lifestyle factors for cancer and the use of CRC screening tests (colonoscopy and faecal occult blood testing) were derived from the 2009 California Health Interview Survey (CHIS) data using the askCHIS tool (http://ask.chis.ucla.edu/main/default.asp, access date: 17 February 2012). Most Asian subgroups (Indian/Pakistani, HR 0.68,P less than 0.0001, Chinese, HR 0.94,P=0.025, and Japanese HR 0.93,P=0.006,), except Hawaiian (HR 1.2,P less than 0.0001), had better DSS than did NHW patients. Many of our findings confirm previous less comprehensive studies including: Asian groups' lower use of screening (FentonNone, 2009); Asian patients presented with more advanced disease than NHW (Ayanian, 2010;RobbinsNone, 2012); a younger average age at diagnosis in Asian patients (KooNone, 2008;NorwoodNone, 2009;SammourNone, 2010).
