However, with unresectable disease, other types of therapy are usually needed, such as anti-hypertensive treatment with pharmacologic agents or inhibitors of catecholamine excess and radiotherapy to palliate painful bone metastases or radiometabolic treatment[None]. Anterior and posterior whole-body scans and spot images were obtained 24 and 48 h after the intravenous administration of 0.5 mCi (18 MBq) of [131I]MIBG using a whole-body scanner (E.CAM 180 dual detector gamma-camera, Siemens Medical Systems, Hoffman Estates, IL) equipped with a high-energy collimator and connected to a dedicated computer system. The average coefficient of variation for measurement of the activity of a lesion was 3.3%. Another limitation is that pathologic data were not available to compare with the changes evident on MIBG imaging. Furthermore, CT and MR studies were not available in all patients for systematic comparison with the MIBG findings.
