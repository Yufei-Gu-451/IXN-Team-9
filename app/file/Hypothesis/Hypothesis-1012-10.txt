We previously reported that Japanese patients have a markedly low prevalence of obesity and low incidence rates of overt nephropathy and diabetic retinopathy (10-13). Given the overestimation of risks of coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke in Chinese patients by the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) risk engine (17,18), risk engines for non-Asian populations may not be transportable to Asian patients. However, just combining the results of risk engines specific to each vascular complication may yield biased estimates of absolute risks since it is likely that each engine was developed independently, and a correlation between incidences of vascular complications is not accounted for in the development process. By the UKPDS risk engine, more than half of patients had a macrovascular risk of 10% or more (249 of the 376 cases and 697 of the 1,372 noncases), as expected by the tendency of overestimation The sensitivity and specificity of the UKPDS risk engine with a cutoff value of 10% risk were 66.2 and 49.2%, respectively. Risk classification of the 1,748 patients according to 5-year risks of macrovascular disease based on the JJ risk engine and the UKPDS risk engineTable 4shows how the combination of 5-year risks of macro- and microvascular complications based on the JJ risk engine classified low-risk and high-risk patients. Risk classification of the 1,748 patients according to 5-year risks of macro- and microvascular diseases based on the JJ risk engineTo illustrate the use of the JJ risk engine, consider two Japanese men 60 years of age with simple diabetic retinopathy and without atrial fibrillation who do not have smoking and exercise habits. In contrast, the UKPDS risk engine overestimated CHD risk, and this tendency is consistent with a previous report in Asian patients (18). The risk equation from the Swedish National Diabetes Register incorporates the use of antihypertensive drugs and lipid-lowering drugs as predictors (9).
