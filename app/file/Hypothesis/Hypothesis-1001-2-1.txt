Provision was made for dose reduction if patients experienced drug-related toxicities. Following the amendment allowing growth factor support, no further protocol-defined DLTs were observed. The sunitinib dose was interrupted in 25 patients and reduced in 12 patients across all cohorts. The study design was modified on Schedule 2/1 to allow growth factor support during cycle 1. Our results suggest that the combination merits further investigation in pancreatic cancer and RCC. Phase II studies of this combination in patients with RCC or pancreatic cancer are underway.
