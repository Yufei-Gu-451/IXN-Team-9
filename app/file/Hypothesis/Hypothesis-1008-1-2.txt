The prevalence of large-for-gestational-age (LGA) infants born to women with type 2 diabetes has been reported as ?50% (1,2). The treatment of pregnant women with type 2 diabetes tends to focus on achieving euglycemia, before, during, and after pregnancy (8). The inclusion criteria were as follows: type 2 diabetes, defined as diabetes diagnosed before pregnancy where the initial management was diet or oral antidiabetic drugs; referral before 22 gestational weeks with a singleton pregnancy; prepregnancy BMI greater than =30 kg/m2; and no concurrent diseases that could affect weight gain. Women of all ethnicities were included. The main outcome variable was birth weightzscore. Gestational weight gain was calculated as the difference between self-reported weight before pregnancy and the last weight measured before delivery. We did not find an increased rate of SGA infants among women gaining less than =5 kg, and all these women received insulin treatment. In conclusion, we found that in obese women with type 2 diabetes, maternal gestational weight gain less than =5 kg was associated with a more proportionate birth weight and less perinatal morbidity without increased risk of SGA infants.
