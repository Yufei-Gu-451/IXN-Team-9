Recent studies have shown that impaired mitochondrial function in the skeletal muscle may be involved in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance (5-7). Recently, we demonstrated that increased IMCL was associated with lower aerobic capacity and impaired intramuscular high-energy phosphate metabolism in patients with MetS (10). Blood glucose, plasma insulin, HbA1c, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglyceride, and free fatty acids were measured. IMCL content in the resting tibialis anterior muscle at the level of the muscle belly of calf was measured by proton (1H)-MRS on a 1.5-Tesla whole-body scanner system (Signa Horizon LX; GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI), as previously described (10). We also measured serum total thiols and enzymatic activity of SOD and GPx. Data are expressed as means +/- SD. Based on the previous report that compared the marker of oxidative stress between control subjects and patients with MetS (22), a sample size of 13 subjects in each group was needed to detect the effect compared with the threshold change of 0 under the conditions of alpha = 0.05 and beta = 0.2. After the initiation of constant load of 20% 1-RM exercise, PCr level in the calf muscle started to decrease and was finally stabilized within a few minutes in all subjects. As a result, muscle PCr loss during exercise was greater in patients with MetS (Table 2). 1None). 1NoneandNone). 2). 2None). There was a close relationship between systemic oxidative stress and impaired skeletal muscle energy metabolism (Fig.
