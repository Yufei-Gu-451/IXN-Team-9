Elevated maternal glucose crosses the placental barrier, leading to fetal hyperinsulinemia, which stimulates growth both directly and indirectly (3,4). Obesity management during pregnancy includes recommendations of appropriate weight gain. Additionally, we investigated whether it seems safe to advise this group of women to gain less than =5 kg regarding maternal health, including diabetes management, and pregnancy outcomes. The inclusion criteria were as follows: type 2 diabetes, defined as diabetes diagnosed before pregnancy where the initial management was diet or oral antidiabetic drugs; referral before 22 gestational weeks with a singleton pregnancy; prepregnancy BMI greater than =30 kg/m2; and no concurrent diseases that could affect weight gain. Women of all ethnicities were included. The main outcome variable was birth weightzscore. Gestational weight gain was calculated as the difference between self-reported weight before pregnancy and the last weight measured before delivery. However, because there were only two women who delivered preterm in the group who gained less than =5 kg, we do not consider the bias crucial for the outcome of this study. In conclusion, we found that in obese women with type 2 diabetes, maternal gestational weight gain less than =5 kg was associated with a more proportionate birth weight and less perinatal morbidity without increased risk of SGA infants.
