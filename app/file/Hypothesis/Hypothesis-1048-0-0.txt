Type 2 diabetes is a chronic, progressive disease associated with obesity that requires multiple interventions to maintain long-term glycemic control (1). Thus, treatments that improve both hyperglycemia and body weight-with a low risk of hypoglycemia-may be more desirable in the treatment of type 2 diabetes than treatments associated with weight gain. Over time, many patients do not achieve adequate glycemic control with oral antidiabetes drugs (OADs) and additional therapies are required to achieve A1C targets of less than =6.5% (2) or less than =7% (1,3). After OADs (i.e., metformin) fail or if OADs are contraindicated, algorithms recommend the use of add-on therapies including insulin or glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (1,2,4). Exenatide once weekly (EQW), the extended-release formulation of exenatide, is a GLP-1 receptor agonist approved for use in the United States and Europe to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes. EQW administered by subcutaneous injection has been shown to provide sustained glycemic control and does not have the undesirable effects of weight gain and hypoglycemia that are typically associated with insulin and some OADs (5-8). Further, weekly dosing may improve adherence to treatment, as suggested by improvements in patient-reported outcomes (9) and therefore may improve therapeutic outcomes (10).
