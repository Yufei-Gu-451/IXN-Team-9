Population studies have consistently demonstrated an inverse association between serum HDL cholesterol levels and the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) (1). The antiatherogenic properties of HDL and its major component apoprotein (apo)A-I are mainly related to reverse cholesterol transport process (i.e., removing excess cholesterol from the arterial wall's foam macrophages to the liver for metabolism). Physiologically, the efficiency of reverse cholesterol transport depends on the activity of lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), and apoA-I activates LCAT to facilitate reverse cholesterol transport and HDL maturation (1-3). Thus, the function of apoA-I and LCAT is essential for maintaining body cholesterol homeostasis. The impact of advanced glycation end products has been implicated in diabetic atherogenesis (4). Since glycation of HDL significantly decreases its ability to inhibit oxidized LDL-induced monocyte-endothelial cell interaction (5,6) and infusion of reconstituted HDL obviously reduces atherosclerotic plaque volume and increases anti-inflammatory and cholesterol efflux properties of plasma HDL in patients with type 2 diabetes (7,8), we hypothesized that glycation of apoA-I might decrease LCAT activation and reverse cholesterol transport, leading to accelerated development of atherosclerotic lesions in diabetic patients.
