We previously reported that Japanese patients have a markedly low prevalence of obesity and low incidence rates of overt nephropathy and diabetic retinopathy (10-13). Furthermore, the risk factor profiles of diabetes complications are quite different between Japanese and Western subjects with diabetes (14). In cohort studies of multiple ethnic groups, lower incidence rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) were observed in Asian patients than in whites (15,16). Data management was conducted by a central data center. A retinopathy event was progression to stage 3 or 4. Further, we constructed a reclassification table of macro- and microvascular complications (34). Tertile Cox regression showed that the 5-year risks calculated by the JJ risk engine effectively classified populations at low and high risk for each complication. By the UKPDS risk engine, more than half of patients had a macrovascular risk of 10% or more (249 of the 376 cases and 697 of the 1,372 noncases), as expected by the tendency of overestimation The sensitivity and specificity of the UKPDS risk engine with a cutoff value of 10% risk were 66.2 and 49.2%, respectively. Risk classification of the 1,748 patients according to 5-year risks of macro- and microvascular diseases based on the JJ risk engineTo illustrate the use of the JJ risk engine, consider two Japanese men 60 years of age with simple diabetic retinopathy and without atrial fibrillation who do not have smoking and exercise habits. For the prediction of stroke, we did not identify smoking status and years after diagnosis as predictors, which are included in the UKPDS risk engine (6). Finally, we defined overt nephropathy as the presence of persistent proteinuria, since an elevated urinary albumin excretion due to nondiabetic renal lesions or conditions is not rare.
