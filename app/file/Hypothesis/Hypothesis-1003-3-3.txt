Post-chemotherapy, 30 lesions showed no MIBG uptake and 43 lesions persisted (26 showed decreased MIBG uptake, 3 had unchanged MIBG uptake, and 14 had increased MIBG uptake). 2. [18F]Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET provides another modality for localization of metastatic pheochromocytoma, although with less tissue specificity than the other functional approaches targeting the catecholamine biosynthetic and storage pathways. In particular, this patient had 37 sites of disease identified by MIBG imaging; after 4.1 months of chemotherapy, MIBG uptake decreased in 13 lesions and disappeared in another 12. [123I]MIBG is preferable to [131I]MIBG because it provides higher-quality images and the lower radiation burden of123I allows a higher permissible dose, resulting in a higher count rate.
