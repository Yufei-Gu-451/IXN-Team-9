Proteinuria was defined as occurrence of one of the following: proteinuria greater than =300 mg/24 h, urine albumin excretion greater than =190 mg/24 h, proteinuria greater than or equal to +1 on a dipstick of sterile urine, or urine albumin-creatinine mass ratio greater than =190 mg/g. Macrosomia was defined as birth weight greater than =4,000 g.Perinatal mortality was fetal death later than 22 weeks of gestation or death within 1 week of delivery. The median weight gain in the total cohort was 9.2 kg (range -4.7 to 25.5 kg); 17 women (29%) gained =5 kg with a median weight gain of 3.7 kg, and 41 (71%) gained 5 kg with a median weight gain of 12.1 kg (Table 2). In this retrospective cohort study evaluating how the medical advice regarding restricting maternal weight gain to 0-5 kg during pregnancy in obese women with type 2 diabetes affects fetal growth and perinatal morbidity in an unselected cohort of patients, we found that those who gained 5 kg or less had infants with a more proportionate birth weight, represented by a smallerzscore, a lower proportion of LGA infants, and a marginally lower ponderal index. Lower gestational weight gain in women with the highest pregestational BMI, as previously found in obese women without diabetes (15), was not present in our material, where women who gained less than =5 kg were less obese before their current pregnancy than those who gained more.
