The current mainstay of treatment for type 1 diabetes (T1D) is insulin therapy, which has proven to be a lifesaving breakthrough. However, insulin treatment cannot fully prevent the severe complications related to the disease, including kidney failure and coronary heart disease (1,2). Successful islet transplantation cures T1D, improves glycometabolic control, reduces hypoglycemic episodes, and halts diabetes complications (3-5). Unfortunately, the rate of functioning islet allografts at 5 years is well below 20% (6), primarily, although not exclusively, due to alloreactive and autoreactive immune responses (7-9). The anti-islet immune response involves a complex interplay between pathogenic and inflammatory immune pathways, which promote rejection, and regulatory or anti-inflammatory immune pathways, which facilitate tolerance toward transplants (10-12); one such pathway is the purinergic system (13). The purine ATP is a small molecule (14) present at high concentrations within cells and released after cell damage or death (15) and immune cell activation (16,17); it acts as a danger signal and potent chemotactic mediator (15,18). ATP is abundant at inflammation sites and is sensed by ionotropic purinergic P2X receptors (seven receptors named P2X1-P2X7, or P2XRs) (19-21). In leukocytes, P2XRs regulate cytokine production, activation, and apoptosis (thus constituting an "autocrine alerting system") (13,22-24). In particular, P2X7R (16,21,25,26) has been linked to T-cell activation and function, serving as a signal amplification mechanism for antigen recognition (13). Recent studies have shown that ATP may be a factor that determines the fate of T cells by promoting Th17 differentiation (24), and Th17 cells have been demonstrated to be relevant in islet allograft rejection (27-29). Inhibiting P2X7R halts the delivery of ATP signals and may redirect the immune system from a Th1/Th17 profile to a more tolerogenic state (30). P2X7R inhibitors are available for human use, including periodate-oxidized ATP (oATP) and CE-224535, thereby rendering P2X7R targeting a potential path to be tested in transplantation.
