After the desired level of ambient glycemia was maintained for 6 h, a third intravenous line was inserted into the right arm and was connected to a syringe infusion pump for administration of inulin and PAH. Plasma cGMP also was measured as a marker of NO production (5). Plasma insulin levels were measured using standard techniques (18). Baseline renal hemodynamic function parameters were similar in the two groups (Table 1) and similar proportions of male and female participants exhibited baseline renal hyperfiltration (GFR greater than 135 mL/min/1.73 m2, 35% of men vs. 33% of women). *P= 0.012 for the effect of hyperglycemia on plasma cGMP in men compared with women. As expected, SBP did not change in either group in response tol-arginine during clamped hyperglycemia. The goal of this study was to determine if the administration of anl-arginine infusion to augment NO synthesis would reverse the exaggerated pressor response to clamped hyperglycemia in women with type 1 DM. Our data therefore suggest that women exhibit enhanced NO bioactivity in the postglomerular circulation at baseline during clamped euglycemia; clamped hyperglycemia alone quenches postglomerular NO, leading to an increase in GFR and FF with lesser effects on ERPF, and these effects are reversible with infusion ofl-arginine. Our second major observation was thatl-arginine reduced GFR and FF in women only, back toward values observed during clamped euglycemia. l-arginine reverses the renal hyperfiltration effect of hyperglycemia in women, suggesting that NO is an important contributor to the regulation of normal vascular function in women with type 1 DM.
