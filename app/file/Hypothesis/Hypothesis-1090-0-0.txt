Type 2 diabetes is a major public health issue that will affect greater than 439 million people worldwide by 2030 (1) and is characterized by impaired beta-cell function and insulin resistance, leading to chronic hyperglycemia (2). Hyperglycemia is the main cause of microvascular and macrovascular complications (3). Type 2 diabetes is a complex metabolic disease in which both environmental and genetic factors are involved. To date, ?40 genetic loci have been found to be associated with type 2 diabetes (4). The Meta-Analysis of Glucose and Insulin-Related Trait Consortium (MAGIC) combined the results of 21 genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in terms of fasting glucose (FG), fasting insulin (FI), and indices of beta-cell function (homeostasis model assessment [HOMA]-B) and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) in 46,186 nondiabetic subjects (5). The authors reported 2 loci associated with FI and HOMA-IR and 16 associated with FG and HOMA-B, including the rs340874 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the prospero homeobox 1 (PROX1) gene. They also showed that carriers of the glucose-raising C allele for the rs340874 SNP display a higher risk of type 2 diabetes. Two studies with oral glucose tolerance tests showed that the C allele of rs340874 is associated with reduced insulin sensitivity and secretion (6,7). In children and adolescents, the meta-analysis by Barker et al. (8) showed that the rs340874 is associated with FG level and, to a lesser extent, HOMA-B, with similar effect sizes to those observed in adults.
