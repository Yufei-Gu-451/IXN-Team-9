Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine the influence of patient, tumour, and treatment factors (age at diagnosis, gender, year of diagnosis, median household income, ethnicity, tumour stage, tumour grade, tumour primary site, and primary surgery) of known or potential prognostic value on DSS. Table 2displays results from the comparisons among eight subgroups in the Asian cohort: Filipino (19.1%), Japanese (26.9%), Chinese (23.9%), Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (6.9%), Korean (7.5%), Indian/Pakistani (3.0%), Vietnamese (5.6%), and others (7.1%). Most Asian subgroups (Indian/Pakistani, HR 0.68,P less than 0.0001, Chinese, HR 0.94,P=0.025, and Japanese HR 0.93,P=0.006,), except Hawaiian (HR 1.2,P less than 0.0001), had better DSS than did NHW patients.
