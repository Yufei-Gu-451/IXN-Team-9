South Asians (people originating from the Indian subcontinent) comprise more than a quarter of the global population and contribute the highest number of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) (1). According to latest estimates, ?61 million people in India alone are currently afflicted with T2D, and their number is projected to increase to ?101 million by 2030 (2). Consequently, ?60% of the world's coronary artery disease (CAD), a principal cause of mortality in individuals with T2D, is expected to occur in India (3). There is considerable ethnic difference in the prevalence and progression of T2D and CAD. In addition to environmental factors, genetic factors influence disease susceptibility (4). The incidence of T2D and CAD is about three to five times higher in immigrant South Asians compared with Euro-Caucasians, and the age of onset of T2D is roughly a decade earlier in South Asians than in Europeans (5-7). The higher prevalence of T2D among South Asians settled in developed countries compared with the host population reflects the genetic and ethnic predisposition to cardiometabolic disease under an adverse environment and the joint effects of genes and environment in the predisposition to T2D (8). For these reasons, we conducted ethnic-specific genetic studies in a Sikh population to dissect genetic pathways that may contribute to T2D etiology in different ethnic groups. The vast majority of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on T2D so far have been performed on Europeans.
