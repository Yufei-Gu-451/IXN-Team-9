Targeting PDGF and VEGF signalling pathways with sunitinib plus gemcitabine may enhance antitumor activity compared with either agent alone. Extensive preclinical evidence suggests additive and/or synergistic effects in solid tumour models when a variety of chemotherapies, including gemcitabine, are combined with targeted agents, including sunitinib (YeeNone, 2004;CarterNone, 2007;ChristensenNone, 2008), as demonstrated in a recently reported phase I trial of sunitinib on a continuous daily dosing schedule plus gemcitabine in patients with advanced solid tumours (BrellNone, 2012). Patients were excluded if previously treated with gemcitabine or sunitinib; had severe/unstable angina, myocardial infarction, symptomatic congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular accident, or transient ischaemic attack within the previous 12 months; National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE, version 3.0) grade 3 haemorrhage within 4 weeks of study entry; uncontrolled hypertension; uncontrolled brain metastases; and a second malignancy diagnosis within the last 5 years. Non-haematological DLTs were any drug-related grade 3 or 4 toxicities lasting ?7 days (except for grade 3/4 hyperamylasemia or hyperlipasemia without signs of pancreatitis, grade 4 hyperuricemia or grade 3/4 hypophosphatemia without clinical symptoms, or grade 3 asymptomatic hypertension), and nausea, vomiting, or diarrhoea persisting at grade 3 or 4 despite treatment. On day 8, if absolute neutrophil count (ANC) was greater than 1000 cellsper mm3, gemcitabine was given as scheduled. In addition, blood samples for determination of trough levels of sunitinib and SU12662 were taken for Schedule 4/2 pre-dose on day 1 (cycles 1-3) and 24 h after the last dose (cycles 1-3 and 5), and for Schedule 2/1 were obtained before dosing on day 1 (cycles 1, 4, and 6), days 8 and 15 (cycle 1) and day 14 (cycles 4, 6, and 10). For gemcitabine and dFdU PK profiles, blood samples were drawn pre-dose and up to 9 h after the start of infusion on cycle 1, days 1 and 22 (with sunitinib on Schedule 4/2) or on cycle 1, days 1 and 8 (with sunitinib on Schedule 2/1). Among 25 patients on Schedule 2/1, post amendment, PRs were observed in 7 patients across the full range of doses: two with pancreatic carcinoma and five with RCC. We conducted a phase I dose-escalation study of sunitinib combined with gemcitabine in patients with advanced solid tumours. In addition, co-administration of sunitinib with gemcitabine did not appear to affect the PK of gemcitabine.
