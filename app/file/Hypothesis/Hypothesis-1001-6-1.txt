Targeting PDGF and VEGF signalling pathways with sunitinib plus gemcitabine may enhance antitumor activity compared with either agent alone. Patients were excluded if previously treated with gemcitabine or sunitinib; had severe/unstable angina, myocardial infarction, symptomatic congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular accident, or transient ischaemic attack within the previous 12 months; National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE, version 3.0) grade 3 haemorrhage within 4 weeks of study entry; uncontrolled hypertension; uncontrolled brain metastases; and a second malignancy diagnosis within the last 5 years. In addition, blood samples for determination of trough levels of sunitinib and SU12662 were taken for Schedule 4/2 pre-dose on day 1 (cycles 1-3) and 24 h after the last dose (cycles 1-3 and 5), and for Schedule 2/1 were obtained before dosing on day 1 (cycles 1, 4, and 6), days 8 and 15 (cycle 1) and day 14 (cycles 4, 6, and 10). Among 25 patients on Schedule 2/1, post amendment, PRs were observed in 7 patients across the full range of doses: two with pancreatic carcinoma and five with RCC. We conducted a phase I dose-escalation study of sunitinib combined with gemcitabine in patients with advanced solid tumours. In addition, co-administration of sunitinib with gemcitabine did not appear to affect the PK of gemcitabine.
