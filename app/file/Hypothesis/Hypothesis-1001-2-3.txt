Thus, treatment that specifically interrupts tumour vasculature through inhibition of various important receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signalling pathways, combined with a chemotherapy, may be of interest. Gemcitabine is used (alone or in combination with other chemotherapies, such as cisplatin or carboplatin) across a broad spectrum of solid tumours, including locally advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, metastatic BC, advanced NSCLC, ovarian cancer, bladder cancer, and others (Gemzar (gemcitabine HCl) prescribing information (2010);Gemzar (gemcitabine HCI) product monograph (2006)). Blood samples for determination of full PK profiles for sunitinib and SU12662 were collected for patients receiving Schedule 4/2 on cycle 1, day 15 (sunitinib alone) and day 22 (sunitinib and gemcitabine), and for patients receiving Schedule 2/1 on cycle 1, day 8 (sunitinib and gemcitabine) and day 15 (sunitinib alone) at pre-dose and up to 25 h post-dose. For gemcitabine and dFdU PK profiles, blood samples were drawn pre-dose and up to 9 h after the start of infusion on cycle 1, days 1 and 22 (with sunitinib on Schedule 4/2) or on cycle 1, days 1 and 8 (with sunitinib on Schedule 2/1). On Schedule 2/1, pre-amendment, treatment-related non-haematological grade ?3 AEs for sunitinib 37.5 mg plus gemcitabine 750 mg m-2were nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, abscess, appendicitis, electrocardiogram QT-prolongation, hyperamylasemia (eachn=1), and hyperlipasemia (n=2). In the earlier phase I trial with gemcitabine, growth factor support was excluded and the recommended phase II dose was gemcitabine 675 mg m-2on days 1 and 8 and sunitinib 25 mg on continuous daily dosing (BrellNone, 2012). Sarcomatoid differentiation, found across all RCC histological subtypes (de Peralta-VenturinaNone, 2001), is thought to represent transformation of RCC to a higher grade (ChevilleNone, 2004;GolshayanNone, 2009), and is associated with a relatively poor prognosis and median overall survival of only ?3-10 months with non-targeted agents (e.g., immunotherapy;de Peralta-VenturinaNone, 2001;EscudierNone, 2002;MianNone, 2002;KwakNone, 2007). Although patient numbers are small, our results compare favourably with a recent retrospective analysis of patients with RCC and sarcomatoid differentiation treated with VEGF- or VEGFR-targeted therapy (GolshayanNone, 2009). Our results also suggest that sunitinib combined with gemcitabine may be a more active regimen than gemcitabine-based chemotherapy, which has also shown limited activity in sarcomatoid RCC (StadlerNone, 2003;NanusNone, 2004). Although targeted therapies have yet to deliver significant advances in pancreatic cancer treatment (O'Reilly 2009), there are indications that combining EGFR-directed and/or antiangiogenic agents with gemcitabine may be beneficial (MooreNone, 2007;Van CutsemNone, 2009).
