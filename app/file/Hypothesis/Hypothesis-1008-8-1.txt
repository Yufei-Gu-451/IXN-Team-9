Pregestational diabetes is associated with various pregnancy complications. In pregnant women without diabetes, obesity is associated with complications such as perinatal mortality and LGA/macrosomia, the risk rising with rising prepregnancy BMI (9,10). Women of all ethnicities were included. At the woman's first pregnancy visit to dedicated diabetes nurses and dietitians, she received guidance and motivation to follow a healthy lifestyle. If necessary, women were advised to have an additional carbohydrate intake during the evening. vs. no). Nearly all women were insulin treated from early pregnancy, but significantly less insulin was needed in the group of women gaining less than =5 kg (Table 2). Pregnancy-related outcomesIn the multiple linear regression analysis, a gestational weight gain of less than =5 kg was significantly associated with a lower birth weightzscore when adjusted for prepregnancy BMI, smoking, HbA1cat last visit, ethnicity, preeclampsia, and nulliparity, (beta = -0.978 [95% CI -1.831 to -0.126],P= 0.025), corresponding to a one SD lower birth weight. The cases of malformation and perinatal mortality were reviewed. From our study, we cannot conclude which level of weight gain should be recommended for obese women with type 2 diabetes, but our data point toward a negligible gain in the first half of pregnancy and a gain of about 150 g per week in the second. This study is limited by its retrospective nature and small sample size, giving it a character of a pilot study.
