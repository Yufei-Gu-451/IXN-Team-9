The risk of maternal and fetal adverse outcomes is greater in pregnancies complicated by type 1 diabetes than in nondiabetic women (1). This is related to the degree of hyperglycemia during pregnancy (1,2). Optimized glycemic control improves the prognosis in these pregnancies, and most pregnant type 1 diabetic women achieve normoglycemia (3-5). Randomized trials and observational studies, including a report from our center, demonstrated that both multiple daily injections (MDIs) and continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) are equally effective and safe (4,5). However, there is scarce data on glycemic control changes after delivery. Several factors potentially deteriorate glycemic control in type 1 diabetic mothers after delivery: less incentive to achieve good metabolic control compared with during pregnancy, duties associated with childcare, and fear of hypoglycemic episodes during childcare.
