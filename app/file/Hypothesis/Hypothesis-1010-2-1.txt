Recent studies have shown that impaired mitochondrial function in the skeletal muscle may be involved in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance (5-7). Peripheral blood samples were collected after 10 h of fasting. Therefore, we established a new association between systemic oxidative stress and aerobic capacity in patients with MetS. Therefore, decreased serum total thiols and SOD activity may contribute to the enhanced systemic oxidative stress in patients with MetS. The impairment of mitochondrial function in the skeletal muscle results in further production of ROS (4,28), which might, at least in part, contribute to the enhanced systemic oxidative stress in patients with MetS. Recent large clinical trials have demonstrated that systemic oxidative stress is related to insulin resistance and obesity (15,16), which is consistent with our results that there were tight correlations between serum TBARS and insulin resistance markers such as FBS, insulin level, or free fatty acid level (Supplementary Fig. Because fatty acids are particularly prone to oxidative damage, lipid peroxidation products are easily formed in the skeletal muscle under the condition of increased ROS production, which can cause mitochondrial damage and subsequently decrease capacity for fatty acid oxidation (29). It has been demonstrated that weight loss induced by diet and exercise therapy improves insulin resistance and reduces biomarkers of systemic oxidative stress in patients with MetS (35). There are some limitations that should be acknowledged.
