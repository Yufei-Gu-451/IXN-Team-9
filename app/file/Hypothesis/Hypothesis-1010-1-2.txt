Lower aerobic capacity is one of the strongest and independent predictors of all-cause mortality in subjects with obesity and insulin resistance (2,3), and it is essential to improve lower aerobic capacity in the treatment of MetS. Moreover, IMCL content positively correlated with muscle PCr loss (r= 0.55;P less than 0.01), indicating that the increased IMCL content might be attributable to impaired fatty acid oxidation in the skeletal muscle in MetS. Moreover, serum total thiols and SOD activity were significantly lower in patients with MetS than control subjects (Fig. 2None). There were also relationships between skeletal muscle energy metabolism and some indices of systemic oxidative stress (Fig. Therefore, we established a new association between systemic oxidative stress and aerobic capacity in patients with MetS. There was a close relationship between systemic oxidative stress and impaired skeletal muscle energy metabolism (Fig. Because fatty acids are particularly prone to oxidative damage, lipid peroxidation products are easily formed in the skeletal muscle under the condition of increased ROS production, which can cause mitochondrial damage and subsequently decrease capacity for fatty acid oxidation (29). In summary, we demonstrated for the first time that systemic oxidative stress including higher levels of lipid peroxidation and lower antioxidant defense capacity was related to lower aerobic capacity and impaired skeletal muscle energy metabolism in patients with MetS.
