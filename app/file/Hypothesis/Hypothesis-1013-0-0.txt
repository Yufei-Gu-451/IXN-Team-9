Human studies have demonstrated a deleterious impact of diabetes mellitus (DM) on endothelial function in women compared with men (1). At the renal microvascular level, we have demonstrated that clamped hyperglycemia is associated with renal hyperfiltration responses in women but not in men (2). Similarly, in type 2 DM, hyperglycemia increases endothelial dysfunction in women, a finding that was absent in men (3). It is not known, however, if this represents a failure to augment maximally stimulated nitric oxide (NO) bioactivity or an absolute reduction in NO generation by the DM metabolic milieu in women compared with men. An exaggerated effect of DM on endothelial dysfunction in women may, in part, be responsible for the "sex-equalizing" effect that DM has on cardiovascular mortality and renal disease progression (3,4). From the renal perspective, we have shown that women with uncomplicated type 1 DM exhibit an augmented renal pressor response to hyperglycemia compared with men, with decreases in renal blood flow (RBF) and effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) and an increase in filtration fraction (FF), suggesting increased efferent renal arteriolar constriction (2).
