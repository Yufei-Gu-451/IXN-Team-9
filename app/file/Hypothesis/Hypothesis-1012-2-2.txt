Asian patients with diabetes have several important features. We previously reported that Japanese patients have a markedly low prevalence of obesity and low incidence rates of overt nephropathy and diabetic retinopathy (10-13). Furthermore, the risk factor profiles of diabetes complications are quite different between Japanese and Western subjects with diabetes (14). In fact, exercise has been shown to reduce all-cause mortality (21,22) and is encouraged by guidelines for type 2 diabetes (23,24). However, just combining the results of risk engines specific to each vascular complication may yield biased estimates of absolute risks since it is likely that each engine was developed independently, and a correlation between incidences of vascular complications is not accounted for in the development process. Data management was conducted by a central data center. Further, we constructed a reclassification table of macro- and microvascular complications (34). The mean +/- SD (range) age and HbA1clevel at baseline of the 1,748 Japanese type 2 diabetic patients was 62.1 +/- 8.6 (40-84) years and 7.9 +/- 1.2 (6.0-15.8)%, respectively, and 49.9% of the subjects were women. All of the risk factors that were retained through the variable selection procedure were incorporated into the JJ risk engine. The O/P ratios for each complication, including noncardiovascular mortality, ranged between 0.93 and 1.08, and Hosmer-Lemeshow tests did not show any significant deviations between the observed and predicted events. Although the prevalence of micro- or macroalbuminuria in Asian hypertensive diabetes is alarmingly high (36), most of the progression to overt nephropathy occurs in a small fraction of patients with elevated HbA1cand SBP values and a smoking habit (12). The predictors of CHD are the same as in the UKPDS risk engine (5) except for the inclusion of NHDL-C instead of the total cholesterol-to-HDL cholesterol ratio.
