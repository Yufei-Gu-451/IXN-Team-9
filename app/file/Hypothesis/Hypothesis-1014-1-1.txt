We have also determined the association between laboratory-derived measures of glycemic control (HbA1c) and presence of renal complications (proteinuria and reduced eGFR) with the 5-year costs of caring for people with diabetes. Physician visit, hospitalization, and ambulatory care costs are available for the entire cohort. Proteinuria was assessed using the median measurement for urine protein. Drug costs were excluded for all patients in this primary outcome. Baseline characteristics for the cohortLaboratory measurements were available for the majority of the cohort: 73% for HbA1c, 66% for proteinuria, and 84% for eGFR. In addition to the laboratory parameters described above, worsening socioeconomic status, Aboriginal status, and increasing Charlson index score were associated with increased 5-year costs. Ordinary least squares regression analysis examining the demographic, clinical, and laboratory factors associated with mean total 5-year costs per patient in people with diabetesThe mean 5-year cost of diabetes in Alberta was CDN $26,978 per patient, excluding drug costs, and CDN $44,511 per patient for patients 65 years of age, including drug costs. (33) studied the association between improvement in glycemic control and cost in a retrospective cohort analysis and found that in patients with high baseline HbA1c( greater than =10%) whose glycemic control improved, statistically significant cost savings were achieved. Our regression model included a "not measured" category for each laboratory marker, which is reflected in the adjusted cost estimates. After controlling for clinical and demographic factors, we found that the cost of caring for people with diabetes increased with suboptimal glycemic control, proteinuria, and worsening kidney function.
