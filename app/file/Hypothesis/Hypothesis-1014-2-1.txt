We have also determined the association between laboratory-derived measures of glycemic control (HbA1c) and presence of renal complications (proteinuria and reduced eGFR) with the 5-year costs of caring for people with diabetes. Physician visit, hospitalization, and ambulatory care costs are available for the entire cohort. Proteinuria was assessed using the median measurement for urine protein. Drug costs were excluded for all patients in this primary outcome. The association between measures of baseline glycemic control, kidney function (including a separate category for people with ESRD on dialysis at baseline), proteinuria, and 5-year cost was determined using multivariate linear regression, controlling for age, sex, Aboriginal status, socioeconomic status, duration of diabetes, and Charlson index score. In addition to the laboratory parameters described above, worsening socioeconomic status, Aboriginal status, and increasing Charlson index score were associated with increased 5-year costs. Ordinary least squares regression analysis examining the demographic, clinical, and laboratory factors associated with mean total 5-year costs per patient in people with diabetesThe mean 5-year cost of diabetes in Alberta was CDN $26,978 per patient, excluding drug costs, and CDN $44,511 per patient for patients 65 years of age, including drug costs. Our regression model included a "not measured" category for each laboratory marker, which is reflected in the adjusted cost estimates. In summary, we have generated updated values for the 5-year cost of caring for patients with diabetes in a universal health care system, which will aid decision makers in planning future resource allocation. After controlling for clinical and demographic factors, we found that the cost of caring for people with diabetes increased with suboptimal glycemic control, proteinuria, and worsening kidney function.
