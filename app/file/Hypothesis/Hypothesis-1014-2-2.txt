Approximately 90% of prevalent diabetes cases are type 2 diabetes (1); therefore, all cost estimates based on this cohort are heavily weighted toward type 2 diabetes. Drug costs were excluded for all patients in this primary outcome. As a secondary outcome, we studied 5-year cumulative costs for the subset of patients greater than 65 years of age, including drug costs. The mean 5-year direct medical costs of diabetes were determined in both cases. These measurements revealed that 2.6% of the cohort had an eGFR 30, indicating severe renal impairment, 4.1% had heavy proteinuria, and 9.8% had inadequate glycemic control ( 9% HbA1c) (Table 1). Excluding drug costs, patients greater than 65 years of age had consistently higher costs. In addition to the laboratory parameters described above, worsening socioeconomic status, Aboriginal status, and increasing Charlson index score were associated with increased 5-year costs. Ordinary least squares regression analysis examining the demographic, clinical, and laboratory factors associated with mean total 5-year costs per patient in people with diabetesThe mean 5-year cost of diabetes in Alberta was CDN $26,978 per patient, excluding drug costs, and CDN $44,511 per patient for patients 65 years of age, including drug costs. In addition, although we found a strong association between glycemic control, proteinuria, and kidney function and costs, it is unknown whether improved management would in fact lead to a decrease in health care costs.
