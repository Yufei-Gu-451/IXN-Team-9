A detailed description of the baseline characteristics and eligibility of subjects in the Look AHEAD Trial has previously been published (6). At baseline, all subjects were diagnosed as having T2DM. Data were available from 3,942 subjects who completed the assessment of fitness at baseline and year 4, which represents 76.6% of the subjects recruited and randomized into the Look AHEAD Trial. Reasons for missing fitness data at year 4 are presented inFig. During months 13-48, ILI participants were to have in-person monthly contact with their lifestyle counselor and monthly contact by telephone or e-mail and were offered two refresher campaigns each year that involved ancillary intervention classes. The focus of the ILI was to implement behavioral strategies that would facilitate adoption and maintenance of eating and PA behaviors that result in weight loss (7). During weeks 3-20, prepackaged, commercially available liquid shakes and snack bars were provided to replace two meals per day at no cost to participants. Participants were instructed initially to increase their PA to at least 50 min/week and progressively increase to at least 175 min/week by week 26 of the intervention. As in ILI, medical care and diabetes treatment for participants in DSE continued to be provided by their personal physician, with no medication adjustments made by study sites. Fitness was defined as the estimated metabolic equivalent (MET) level based on the treadmill workload (i.e., speed and grade) achieved at the point of termination of the graded exercise test. The test was terminated when the participant reached 80% of age-predicted maximal heart rate (for those not taking a beta-blocker) or attained a rating of 16 on the 15-category rating of perceived exertion (RPE) scale (8) (for those taking a beta-blocker). LTPA was assessed at baseline, year 1, and year 4 on a subsample of subjects using a questionnaire (9) that was completed as part of a structured interview. Because clinic site was the randomization stratification factor, it was adjusted in the mixed-effects model. For the model with year 4 change in HbA1cas the outcome, covariates included baseline HbA1cand fitness, weight change from baseline to year 4, and prescribed diabetes medication use. Model 2 regressed each potential mediator (changes in weight and fitness) against treatment group. The number of participants in the DSE group missing fitness is significantly higher than in the ILI group (P= 0.002). When data for only those subjects who completed the fitness test at year 4 were examined, there was a significant difference in weight change for ILI (-4.9% [95% CI -5.5 to -4.5%]) compared with DSE (-1.2% [-1.5 to -0.8%]). Based on the subsample of subjects for whom LTPA data were available, the change in LTPA from baseline to year 1 was significantly greater in ILI (871.6 kcal/week [95% CI 775.6-967.6 kcal/week];n= 1,120) compared with DSE (107.7 kcal/week [33.7-181.7];n= 1,104) (P less than 0.0001). These analyses showed that the following baseline characteristics were associated with significantly greater improvements in fitness at year 4: lower BMI, younger age, male sex, race self-identified as white, not taking diabetes medication, not taking insulin, lower HbA1c, not having metabolic syndrome, and no prior history of CVD. When adjusted for clinical site, treatment, baseline HbA1c, diabetes medication use, baseline fitness, and weight change, the inverse relationship between change in HbA1cand fitness was significant both overall (P less than 0.0001) and for both DSE (P less than 0.0001) and ILI (P less than 0.001) (Fig. 3). Post hoc analysis showed that there was a significant difference for change in HbA1cbetween subjects grouped as having a greater than 10% increase in fitness and both subject groups as having a greater than 10% decline in fitness (P less than 0.0001) and a 0-10% decline in fitness (P less than 0.0001) at 4 years, with these comparisons remaining significant when data were analyzed separately for DSE and ILI. When change in fitness was treated as a continuous variable and with adjustment for selected covariates, there was a significant inverse association between HbA1cand change in fitness at 4 years (beta = -0.00431, SE = 0.00048,P less than 0.0001), and this was consistent when analyzed separately for DSE (beta = -0.0286, SE = 0.00130,P= 0.03) and ILI (beta = -0.00295, SE = 0.00106,P less than 0.0001). For example, the results of our mediation analysis showed that both weight loss and fitness change mediated the effect on change in HbA1c. However, it is important to recognize that the effect of weight loss on change in HbA1cwas significantly greater than the effect of change in fitness, but this does not minimize the important contribution of fitness in improving glycemic control. Within the Look AHEAD Trial for participants providing fitness data at year 4, 35.0% (n= 702) of participants in ILI achieved a 10% or greater increase in fitness at year 4, compared with 26.1% (n= 500) of participants in DSE. The contribution of fitness to improving glycemic control, and the finding that ILI resulted in greater improvements in fitness compared with DSE, may be of particular importance in the Look AHEAD Trial, where the primary research question is to compare CVD outcomes in response to ILI compared with DSE. The Look AHEAD Trial is one of the longest prospective randomized clinical trials to implement a lifestyle intervention targeting weight loss and improvement in fitness in overweight and obese adults with T2DM. LTPA was also assessed on a subsample of subjects using a questionnaire, which may have influenced the accuracy of this measurement. These results demonstrated an association between change in fitness and improvements in glycemic control, expressed as HbA1c, even after controlling for weight loss in both ILI and DSE. This finding supports the need for primary care interventions to promote PA that results in significant improvements in fitness in patients with T2DM.
