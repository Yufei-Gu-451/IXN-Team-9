The setting of islet transplantation is interesting because both allogenic rejection and recurrence of autoimmunity may occur and affect graft survival. Histological evidence of these mechanisms is extremely rare (1,2) because obtaining biopsy specimens from transplanted human islets is difficult (3). Consequently, surrogate markers of allo- and autoimmunity are used to evaluate the adaptive immune response of islet graft recipients (4). Poor islet transplant outcome is associated with the presence of pretransplant autoreactive T cells (5-7) and pretransplant or de novo donor-specific cytotoxic and CD4+T cells (7-11). This evidence from monitoring cellular immunity strongly suggests that long-term clinical outcome after islet transplantation is hampered by rejection, recurrence of autoimmunity, or both. Although compelling, the practical aspects of monitoring cellular immunity after islet transplantation is challenging. Monitoring of humoral immunity is easier and has now been validated for both alloimmunity (12-14) and islet autoimmunity (15). It is largely accepted that preformed pretransplant autoimmune antibodies only weakly predict posttransplant outcome (5,16-19), whereas preformed alloreactive antibodies are an important negative predictor of islet transplant outcome (20).
