Plasma cGMP also was measured as a marker of NO production (5). Renal function and circulating cGMP measurements were assessed at the end of eachl-arginine infusion period, as described in previous experiments (6). All renal hemodynamic measurements were adjusted for body surface area (14,16). Baseline renal hemodynamic function parameters were similar in the two groups (Table 1) and similar proportions of male and female participants exhibited baseline renal hyperfiltration (GFR greater than 135 mL/min/1.73 m2, 35% of men vs. 33% of women). In response to clamped hyperglycemia, cGMP levels did not change in men but did decline in women, and the between-group effect of hyperglycemia on cGMP was significant (Fig. As expected from our previous work, induction of clamped hyperglycemia also was associated with significant increases in SBP, GFR, and FF in women but not in men (Tables 1and2). Our major observations included that expected increases in GFR and FF in response to clamped hyperglycemia were associated with exaggerated declines in cGMP in women. The goal of the current study was to determine if NO synthase activation withl-arginine would reverse sex-dependent renal hemodynamic and blood pressure differences in the response to clamped hyperglycemia in type 1 DM patients. Our data therefore suggest that women exhibit enhanced NO bioactivity in the postglomerular circulation at baseline during clamped euglycemia; clamped hyperglycemia alone quenches postglomerular NO, leading to an increase in GFR and FF with lesser effects on ERPF, and these effects are reversible with infusion ofl-arginine. Our second major observation was thatl-arginine reduced GFR and FF in women only, back toward values observed during clamped euglycemia.
