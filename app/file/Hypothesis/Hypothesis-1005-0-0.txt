Extranodal lymphoma refers to lymphomatous involvement in sites other than the lymph nodes, tonsils, thymus and Waldeyer lymphatic ring. It has an incidence of approximately 40% in lymphoma patients and can occur in any organ, however involvement of the peritoneal cavity is a rare clinical presentation. Extranodal lymphoma is a poor prognostic indicator overall[None,None]. According to the published data, the gastrointestinal tract is involved in 10-30% of patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and involvement of the solid organs varies from 20 to 40% in the spleen to 4% in the adrenal glands[None]. An autopsy series of 322 patients with NHL aimed to demonstrate the incidence of omental involvement, and they found evidence of involvement in 64 patients (20%)[None,None]. Peritoneal lymphomatosis is defined as the intraperitoneal spread of lymphoma.
