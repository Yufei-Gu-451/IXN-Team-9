There is increasing interest in identifying markers of chronic diseases. A useful biomarker is a molecule that1) is easily and specifically measurable in accessible body fluids,2) improves prediction algorithms,3) tracks an underlying pathophysiological mechanism,4) changes consensually with the mechanism, and possibly,5) maps onto a new disease pathway. This search hopes not only to provide a more accurate prediction of disease but also follow its evolution and response to intervention and expose new potential therapeutic targets. Recent studies have used different extents of metabolomic profiling to uncover metabolic signatures of obesity (1-3), fatty liver disease (4), and type 2 diabetes (T2D) (5). In previous work (6), we screened several hundred metabolites to identify novel circulating biomarkers of insulin resistance (IR)-as measured by the euglycemic clamp technique-in selected subjects in the Relationship between Insulin Sensitivity and Cardiovascular Disease (RISC) study, a cohort of well-phenotyped nondiabetic individuals. The top biomarker of IR emerging from this analysis was a previously unrecognized metabolite identified as alpha-hydroxybutyrate (alpha-HB), an organic acid positioned at an interesting crossroad of intermediary metabolism-amino acid catabolism and glutathione synthesis-and upstream to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The next top-ranking biomarker was linoleoyl-glycerophosphocholine (L-GPC), an independent correlate of insulin sensitivity and a putative lipid-signaling molecule. Because these biomarkers of insulin sensitivity were independently associated with glucose intolerance (6) and IR is a risk factor for T2D (7), we carried out a clinically validated assay of these metabolites in the entire RISC cohort at baseline and follow-up to evaluate their predictivity of incident dysglycemia.
