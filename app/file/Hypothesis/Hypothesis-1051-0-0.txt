Diabetic peripheral neuropathy is a severe complication of type 2 diabetes related to chronic hyperglycemia and the presence of cardiovascular risk factors (1). Symmetrical distal sensorimotor polyneuropathy (DSPN), the most common form of peripheral neuropathies in patients with diabetes, is a heterogeneous disorder covering a wide range of abnormalities that affect peripheral sensory and motor nerves as well as the autonomic nervous system (2). Of all diabetes complications, DSPN is responsible for the highest number of hospital admissions and, being the foremost cause of foot ulcers, for 50-75% of all nontraumatic amputations after ulceration (3). Next to substantial morbidity, DSPN leads to reduced quality of life and an increased risk of mortality (1,4). In recognition of the importance of early detection and prevention of DSPN, American (5), British (6), and German (7) national guidelines for diabetes care state that all patients with type 2 diabetes should be screened for clinical DSPN at the time of their diabetes diagnosis and yearly thereafter. Screening is to be performed using simple clinical tests, such as vibration perception, pressure sensation, assessment of ankle reflexes, and pinprick sensation.
