Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is an increasing health concern in the U.S., and it is projected that the prevalence of this disease could exceed 13% in adults greater than 20 years of age by the year 2021 (1). This is of significant public health concern because of the known association between diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) (2). The Look AHEAD Trial is a multicenter clinical trial that was undertaken to examine the effect of weight loss and fitness on CVD end points in individuals with T2DM. The year 4 outcomes of the Look AHEAD Trial, which were reported recently, demonstrated the effects of an intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) compared with a diabetes support and education (DSE) intervention on weight loss and CVD risk factors, where weight loss was significantly greater in ILI compared with DSE (3). An important component of the Look AHEAD Trial was the use of objective measures of fitness on all individuals randomized to participate in this study. We previously reported that fitness was significantly increased in ILI compared with DSE after 1 year of intervention (4), and that fitness remained significantly higher in ILI compared with DSE after 4 years of participation in this study (3). These are important findings because others (5) have reported a reduction in the risk of CVD mortality associated with higher levels of fitness.
