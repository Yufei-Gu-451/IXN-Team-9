Physician visit, hospitalization, and ambulatory care costs are available for the entire cohort. We used the validated National Diabetes Surveillance System definition: two or more physician claims for diabetes (ICD-9 code 250.x) within 2 years, or one or more hospitalizations with an ICD-9 code of 250.x, selected from all available diagnostic codes on the Hospital Discharge Abstract prior to 31 March 2002 or equivalent ICD-10 codes (E10-14) after 31 March 2002 (19,20). Proteinuria was assessed using the median measurement for urine protein. Drug costs were excluded for all patients in this primary outcome. In addition to the laboratory parameters described above, worsening socioeconomic status, Aboriginal status, and increasing Charlson index score were associated with increased 5-year costs. Adjusted costs increased fivefold for people with eGFR 15 mL/min/m2compared with eGFR greater than 90 mL/min/m2($115,348 vs. $25,316) and were twice as high in patients with heavy proteinuria compared with those with no proteinuria ($46,836 vs. $24,531). (33) studied the association between improvement in glycemic control and cost in a retrospective cohort analysis and found that in patients with high baseline HbA1c( greater than =10%) whose glycemic control improved, statistically significant cost savings were achieved. Our regression model included a "not measured" category for each laboratory marker, which is reflected in the adjusted cost estimates. In summary, we have generated updated values for the 5-year cost of caring for patients with diabetes in a universal health care system, which will aid decision makers in planning future resource allocation. After controlling for clinical and demographic factors, we found that the cost of caring for people with diabetes increased with suboptimal glycemic control, proteinuria, and worsening kidney function.
