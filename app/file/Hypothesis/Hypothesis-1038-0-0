Children with Down syndrome (DS) are at increased risk of thyroid (1), gut (2), and islet autoimmunity (3,4). In the only population-based study that has addressed the prevalence of DS in type 1 diabetes patients, a more than fourfold increased prevalence was observed (5). It has been suggested that diabetes in children with DS presents particularly early in life; one study from the 1960s showed a peak onset of 8 years of age, compared with 14 years in cases of childhood diabetes (6). In a previous study of DS and diabetes, 22% of participants had developed diabetes by 2 years of age, compared with only 7% of those with type 1 diabetes from the general population (7). A recent study of 159 DS children diagnosed with type 1 diabetes (DSD) demonstrated two peaks in diabetes incidence, one occurring before 2 years of age and the other in early adolescence.
