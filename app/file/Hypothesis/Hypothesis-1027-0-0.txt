The eligibility criteria for bariatric surgery established by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in 1992 (1) are still the most widely used (2). According to these criteria, eligible individuals should have a BMI greater than =40 kg/m2or a BMI between 35 and 40 kg/m2if they have high-risk comorbidities such as severe type 2 diabetes or cardiovascular risk factors. Therefore, individuals with a BMI between 35 and 40 kg/m2without comorbidities or with a BMI less than 35 kg/m2are noneligible for bariatric surgery (1). In 1987, when the Swedish Obese Subjects (SOS) study was started, no official eligibility criteria for bariatric surgery existed.
