Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a common and serious condition. It is the leading cause of blindness among working-age adults in the United States (1). Vision loss related to eye disease among people with diabetes is an important disability that threatens independence and can lead to depression, reduced mobility, and reduced quality of life (2). Furthermore, a recent study by Narayan et al. (3) demonstrated that diabetes prevalence in the United States is likely to increase dramatically through 2050, given recent increases in the incidence of diagnosed diabetes, decreases in diabetes-related mortality, and expected changes in the age of the population.
