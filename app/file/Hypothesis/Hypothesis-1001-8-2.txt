Targeting PDGF and VEGF signalling pathways with sunitinib plus gemcitabine may enhance antitumor activity compared with either agent alone. In addition, up to six additional patients could be included at specific dose levels on either schedule to further define the observed toxicity profile. Schedule 4/2 was not evaluated past the initial combination dose level (sunitinib 37.5 mg and gemcitabine 750 mg m-2) as it proved to be an awkward scheduling regimen in practice because of missed or delayed doses of gemcitabine (see Determination of MTD). Missed doses of day 8 gemcitabine were not made up. The primary objective was to assess the MTD and overall safety and tolerability of sunitinib administered in combination with gemcitabine in patients with advanced solid tumours. Two of eleven patients (18%) on Schedule 2/1, pre-amendment, had DLTs at the dose level of sunitinib 37.5 mg+gemcitabine 750 mg m-2(appendicitis/abscess and QTc prolongation). Haematological AEs were neutropenia (grade 3 (n=1) and grade 4 (n=2)) and leucopenia (grade 3 (n=2)). Treatment-related AEs (grade ?3) occurring among the 25 patients on Schedule 2/1, post-amendment, are detailed inTable 3. s.d. Across all schedules and cohorts, 6/23 patients (26%) with RCC achieved a PR and 13 patients (57%) exhibited s.d. Preliminary antitumor data suggest clinical benefit in patients with particular malignancies, including poor-risk RCC. Phase II studies of this combination in patients with RCC or pancreatic cancer are underway.
