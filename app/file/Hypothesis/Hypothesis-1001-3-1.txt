Provision was made for dose reduction if patients experienced drug-related toxicities. Missed doses of day 8 gemcitabine were not made up. Following the amendment allowing growth factor support, no further protocol-defined DLTs were observed. The gemcitabine dose was not modified in any patients. Among these twelve patients, five achieved a PR and seven had SD. Our results suggest that the combination merits further investigation in pancreatic cancer and RCC.
