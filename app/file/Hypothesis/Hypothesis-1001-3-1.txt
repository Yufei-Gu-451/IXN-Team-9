Extensive preclinical evidence suggests additive and/or synergistic effects in solid tumour models when a variety of chemotherapies, including gemcitabine, are combined with targeted agents, including sunitinib (YeeNone, 2004;CarterNone, 2007;ChristensenNone, 2008), as demonstrated in a recently reported phase I trial of sunitinib on a continuous daily dosing schedule plus gemcitabine in patients with advanced solid tumours (BrellNone, 2012). Planned dose-escalation schemes for sunitinib (both schedules) and gemcitabine are shown inTable 1. The initial cohorts were expanded to six patients if 1/3 patients experienced a DLT (as defined below) during cycle 1. Provision was made for dose reduction if patients experienced drug-related toxicities. For gemcitabine and dFdU PK profiles, blood samples were drawn pre-dose and up to 9 h after the start of infusion on cycle 1, days 1 and 22 (with sunitinib on Schedule 4/2) or on cycle 1, days 1 and 8 (with sunitinib on Schedule 2/1). The gemcitabine dose was not modified in any patients. Non-haematological treatment-related AEs included: grade 4 uric acid elevation (n=2), hypertension, pulmonary embolism, and cerebrovascular accident (n=1 each), grade 3 elevation of amylase (n=2) or lipase (n=1), hypertension, pericardial effusion, leukoencephalopathy, nausea, mucosal inflammation, hypophosphatemia, and hypomagnesemia (eachn=1). In contrast, increases in grade 3 or higher non-haematological toxicity were reported for the combination of sunitinib plus erlotinib in a phase III trial of NSCLC (ScagliottiNone, 2012). This treatment regimen has promising antitumor activity, surpassing that shown in the earlier gemcitabine phase I combination trial, in which 4 of 33 patients had a PR (BrellNone, 2012). In conclusion, patients with advanced solid malignancies for whom curative therapy was not available tolerated sunitinib and gemcitabine at the maximum approved doses of each agent on Schedule 2/1 with growth factor support.
