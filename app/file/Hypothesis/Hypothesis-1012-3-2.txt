We previously reported that Japanese patients have a markedly low prevalence of obesity and low incidence rates of overt nephropathy and diabetic retinopathy (10-13). Another concern is the lack of capacity to assess multiple diseases simultaneously (25). The present analysis excluded patients who had any history of angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, stroke, peripheral artery disease, familial hypercholesterolemia (diagnosed clinically by markedly elevated LDL cholesterol levels with enlarged Achilles tendons and/or family history of premature coronary artery disease), type III hyperlipidemia (diagnosed by broad beta-band on electrophoresis), nephrotic syndrome, serum creatinine levels greater than 1.3 mg/dL (120 mumol/L), mean values of two spot urine examinations for an albumin excretion rate of 150 mg/g creatinine (17.0 mg/mmol) or more, microscopic hematuria, or other clinical findings indicating other renal diseases, preproliferative and proliferative retinopathy, and major ocular disease (e.g., glaucoma, dense cataract, or history of cataract surgery). Further, we constructed a reclassification table of macro- and microvascular complications (34). Their mean baseline values indicated that the subjects had good control of weight (BMI = 23.2 +/- 3.1 kg/m2; waist circumference = 80.3 +/- 9.6 cm), blood pressure (SBP = 132.9 +/- 16.0 mmHg), and serum cholesterol levels (NHDL-C = 3.78 +/- 0.90 mmol/L; LDL cholesterol = 3.16 +/- 0.82 mmol/L; HDL cholesterol = 1.43 +/- 0.44 mmol/L; triglycerides = 1.39 +/- 0.88 mmol/L). Of the 866 patients who had retinopathy or developed retinopathy after baseline, 113 (13.0%) had progression to retinopathy of stage 3 or 4. By the UKPDS risk engine, more than half of patients had a macrovascular risk of 10% or more (249 of the 376 cases and 697 of the 1,372 noncases), as expected by the tendency of overestimation The sensitivity and specificity of the UKPDS risk engine with a cutoff value of 10% risk were 66.2 and 49.2%, respectively. In contrast, only 101 of the 376 cases (26.9%) who developed any of the events had a macrovascular risk of 10% or more based on the JJ risk engine, yielding sensitivity of 26.9% and specificity of 89.1%. The risk of noncardiovascular mortality is estimated to be 4.0%. Fourth, data on peripheral arterial disease and hemoglobin levels were not available. Finally, we defined overt nephropathy as the presence of persistent proteinuria, since an elevated urinary albumin excretion due to nondiabetic renal lesions or conditions is not rare.
