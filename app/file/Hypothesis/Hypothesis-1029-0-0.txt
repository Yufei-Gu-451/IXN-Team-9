Adipose tissue is recognized as an active endocrine organ producing proteins (adipokines), such as adiponectin (ADI), that modulate insulin sensitivity and thus can play a role in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance, diabetes, and atherosclerosis (1-4). Zinc-alpha2-glycoprotein (ZAG) is a secreted soluble protein that has been found in plasma and is expressed in several human tissues, including subcutaneous and visceral adipocytes (5,6). ZAG has a molecular mass of 41 kDa (7). Its name is derived from its tendency to precipitate with zinc and from its electrophoretic migration in the region of alpha2-globulins. A plethora of biological functions have been ascribed to ZAG, including a role in the immune response and in the inhibition of tumor proliferation (8,9). Furthermore, studies in ZAG-deficient mice have suggested that ZAG contributes to the control of body weight and lipolysis (10). ZAG mRNA and protein expression are downregulated in adipose tissue of ob/ob mice that have decreased circulating ZAG levels (11). Furthermore, treatment with purified ZAG caused a reduction in body fat in obese and normal weight mice (12,13). In humans, ZAG mRNA levels have been reported to be decreased in fat of obese women (14) and men (6). A recent study in humans has shown expression of ZAG mRNA in visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue to be negatively correlated with the BMI, plasma insulin, and leptin mRNA (15).
