Natriuretic peptides are important cardiac hormones that have both diagnostic and prognostic values in patients with heart failure (1,2). A-type natriuretic peptide (ANP) and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) are derivates of precursor hormones, which are split into the biologically active peptides (ANP and BNP) as well as the biologically inactiveN-terminal fragments (N-terminal pro-A-type natriuretic peptide [NT-proANP] andN-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide [NT-proBNP]). Because of variable accessibility and fragmentation of the detected antigen, assays for NT-proANP have performed disappointingly (3,4). A novel immunoassay has been developed that measures a more stable fragment of proANP, the midregional fragment of proANP (MR-proANP). Although there are conflicting results with respect to the value of biomarkers, there is still great interest in developing new assays, including MR-proANP, to optimize identifying those patients at increased risk for development of cardiovascular complications (5). Head-to-head comparisons between MR-proANP and NT-proBNP have shown that both peptides are comparable in predicting cardiovascular events and mortality, and in diagnosing heart failure (6-9). Among patients with chronic heart failure, measurement of MR-proANP even provided prognostic information with respect to mortality independent of NT-proBNP (10,11), There is only one study that has specifically investigated MR-proANP in a cohort of patients with type 2 diabetes (12).
