For people living with type 1 diabetes, the daily challenge is to strike an acceptable balance of self-care activities to achieve optimal glycemic outcomes without damaging quality of life (QoL). Glycemic control is objective, easy to measure, and emphasized in clinical studies. QoL is subjective, poses significant measurement challenges, and is often forgotten or ignored. Over 10 years ago, a prominent U.S. psychologist urged that behavioral outcomes in diabetes studies be accorded the same importance as biomedical outcomes (1). More recently, the U.K. National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence has recognized QoL as an important treatment goal in diabetes (2). The need to assess patient-reported outcome measures has been recognized by the U.K. Department of Health with, for example, introduction of the requirement to capture patient-reported assessment of health before and after certain elective procedures (3). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has also issued definitive guidance promoting the use of patient-reported outcome measures in medicinal labeling claims (4).
