Some studies have discussed the incidence of and mortality rates differences between Asian Americans and other ethnic groups, but few examined disparities among Asian subgroup populations (ChienNone, 2005;WhiteNone, 2010). The purpose of this analysis was to determine whether there are significant differences in presentation, clinicopathologic features, treatment, and survival rates between non-Hispanic white (NHW) and Asian; and between Asian subgroups in patients with CRC. In addition, lifestyle factors and screening prevalence were analysed to determine whether any disparities exist between the Asian subgroups and other ethnic groups residing in the United States and to explore the potential associations among these difference.
