The treatment of pregnant women with type 2 diabetes tends to focus on achieving euglycemia, before, during, and after pregnancy (8). Additionally, we investigated whether it seems safe to advise this group of women to gain less than =5 kg regarding maternal health, including diabetes management, and pregnancy outcomes. Proteinuria was defined as occurrence of one of the following: proteinuria greater than =300 mg/24 h, urine albumin excretion greater than =190 mg/24 h, proteinuria greater than or equal to +1 on a dipstick of sterile urine, or urine albumin-creatinine mass ratio greater than =190 mg/g. The median weight gain in the total cohort was 9.2 kg (range -4.7 to 25.5 kg); 17 women (29%) gained =5 kg with a median weight gain of 3.7 kg, and 41 (71%) gained 5 kg with a median weight gain of 12.1 kg (Table 2). Maternal characteristics at first visitMaternal HbA1c, urine ketone bodies, weight gain, and insulin treatment during pregnancyA gestational weight gain of less than =5 kg was significantly associated with a more proportionate birth weight with lower median birth weightzscore (-0.44 [range -3.31 to 1.98] vs. 0.84 [-2.32 to 4.02],P= 0.008) as well as a lower rate of LGA infants (P= 0.041) compared with those gaining greater than 5 kg during pregnancy (Table 3). Pregnancy-related outcomesIn the multiple linear regression analysis, a gestational weight gain of less than =5 kg was significantly associated with a lower birth weightzscore when adjusted for prepregnancy BMI, smoking, HbA1cat last visit, ethnicity, preeclampsia, and nulliparity, (beta = -0.978 [95% CI -1.831 to -0.126],P= 0.025), corresponding to a one SD lower birth weight. In this retrospective cohort study evaluating how the medical advice regarding restricting maternal weight gain to 0-5 kg during pregnancy in obese women with type 2 diabetes affects fetal growth and perinatal morbidity in an unselected cohort of patients, we found that those who gained 5 kg or less had infants with a more proportionate birth weight, represented by a smallerzscore, a lower proportion of LGA infants, and a marginally lower ponderal index. Further, we found that perinatal morbidity was lower and the prevalence of SGA unchanged in offspring of women who gained 5 kg or less during pregnancy. At their first pregnancy visit, all women received education about the increased risk of complications in pregnancies with diabetes and were motivated toward a healthy lifestyle. We did not find an increased rate of SGA infants among women gaining less than =5 kg, and all these women received insulin treatment. Our data suggest that it is seemingly safe to advise obese women with type 2 diabetes to gain less than =5 kg during pregnancy.
