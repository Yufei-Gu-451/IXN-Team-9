Although psychosocial stress and trauma are increasingly recognized as risk factors for cardiovascular disease (1-6), less is known about the ways common stressors may influence the development of type 2 diabetes, despite acknowledged overlap in cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes etiologies (7-10). Child abuse and intimate partner violence (IPV) are prevalent sources of stress for American women, with 43% of women reporting physical abuse in childhood or adolescence (11) and almost a quarter reporting physical abuse by an intimate partner as adults (11,12). Recent studies have indicated that child abuse and IPV are risk factors for hypertension and cardiovascular events (13,14). Child abuse and IPV may influence type 2 diabetes through depression (15-17) and/or through behavioral coping mechanisms that lead to increases in BMI (18-20). More direct endocrine mechanisms may involve hypercortisolemia and insulin resistance (21). A handful of studies have been conducted on child abuse and type 2 diabetes and showed positive associations (19,20,22,23). In our own work, we have documented 25-70% increases in type 2 diabetes rates associated with exposure to moderate to severe physical or sexual abuse in childhood (19).
