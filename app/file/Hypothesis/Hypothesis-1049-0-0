Malnutrition is associated with an increased risk of hospital complications, a higher mortality rate, a longer hospital stay, and higher hospitalization costs (1). The beneficial effect of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) in improving the nutritional status of hospitalized patients who are malnourished is well established (2). However, several retrospective and prospective studies have shown that the use of TPN is an independent risk factor for the onset or aggravation of hyperglycemia independently of a history of diabetes (2,3). Hyperglycemia in hospitalized patients is associated with a higher risk of complications and death, especially when no insulin therapy is used (3-11).
