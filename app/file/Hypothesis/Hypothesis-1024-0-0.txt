Fetuin-A (alpha-Heremans-Schmid glycoprotein) is a liver-synthesized protein that is secreted into serum. Fetuin-A can bind the insulin receptor and thereby inhibit insulin signaling (1-3). In humans, higher levels are associated with higher triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, BMI, and insulin resistance (4,5), in addition to incident diabetes (6-8). However, fetuin-A also complexes with circulating calcium and phosphorus and increases the solubility of these minerals (9), thereby inhibiting arterial calcium deposition. Fetuin-A knockout mice are characterized by both improved insulin sensitivity and ectopic calcification (9-11). Thus far, little is known about the relationship of fetuin-A with cardiovascular disease (CVD) in human populations.
