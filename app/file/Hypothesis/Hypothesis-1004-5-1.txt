Therefore, increasingbvalues result in greater signal attenuation in less cellular areas, e.g. Therefore lesions may appear to show impeded diffusion on the highbvalue images (i.e. This provides the 95% confidence limits of the ADC measurement variation on a per patient basis. Selected publications on the use of DWI for the assessment of liver cirrhosis. Table 2summarizes published papers utilizing DW-MRI for the assessment of liver fibrosis. Significant hepatic steatosis has been shown to lower hepatic ADC values.

In cirrhotic liver, HCC (arrows) typically (a) demonstrates hyperenhancement in the arterial phase of low molecular weight Gd contrast-enhanced imaging; (b) appears relatively hypointense to liver in the portovenous or interstitial phase of contrast enhancement (washout) and (c) shows impeded diffusion on diffusion-weighted imaging (b = 500 s mm-2). The prediction and detection of therapeutic response and the detection of residual disease are paramount in oncologic imaging. This ADC increase was not seen in lesions that showed no change or disease progression[None].
