Recent studies have shown that impaired mitochondrial function in the skeletal muscle may be involved in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance (5-7). In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that systemic oxidative stress is associated with lower aerobic capacity and impaired skeletal muscle energy metabolism in patients with MetS. Peripheral blood samples were collected after 10 h of fasting. Serum TBARS were significantly increased in patients with MetS (Fig. Moreover, serum total thiols and SOD activity were significantly lower in patients with MetS than control subjects (Fig. We previously demonstrated that NAD(P)H oxidase-derived O2-production was significantly increased in the skeletal muscle from high-fat diet-induced diabetic mice in association with lower aerobic capacity and mitochondrial dysfunction in the skeletal muscle, and inhibition of NAD(P)H oxidase ameliorated these impairments (27). The impairment of mitochondrial function in the skeletal muscle results in further production of ROS (4,28), which might, at least in part, contribute to the enhanced systemic oxidative stress in patients with MetS. Recent large clinical trials have demonstrated that systemic oxidative stress is related to insulin resistance and obesity (15,16), which is consistent with our results that there were tight correlations between serum TBARS and insulin resistance markers such as FBS, insulin level, or free fatty acid level (Supplementary Fig. The increased uptake of fatty acids and decreased fatty acid oxidation in the skeletal muscle may result in accumulation of muscle lipids, which can further deteriorate skeletal muscle energy metabolism, known as lipotoxicity (29,30).
