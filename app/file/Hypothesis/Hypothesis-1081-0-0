In the past 5 years, genome-wide association studies have identified common genetic loci associated with BMI (in kilograms per meters squared) mainly in European populations (1-4). It has been suggested that genetic effects of BMI risk variants vary by age (1-7). However, most studies about age-varying effects have focused on childhood and adolescence or contrasted these developmental periods to adulthood (3-8). While it is known that adulthood weight changes are substantial, with weight gain common in earlier to mid-age adulthood and unintentional weight loss in later adulthood, evidence is limited for any differences in the heritable variation of weight across the transition from young adulthood to older adulthood.
