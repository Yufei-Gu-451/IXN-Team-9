The association between insulin resistance and risk of cardiovascular disease has been studied in multiethnic samples in large prospective studies, yet an equivocal relationship has not been established (1,2). Several prospective studies have demonstrated significant associations between insulin resistance and subsequent risk of cardiovascular disease outcomes in Hispanic (3), African American, and Caucasian (4) adults, whereas other studies have failed to consistently demonstrate a significant relationship between insulin resistance and the development of cardiovascular disease (2). Inconsistencies in the literature may be explained by differences in the ethnic group studied, because ethnic background may moderate the relationship between insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease outcomes (1). In cross-sectional studies, significant relationships have been shown between insulin resistance and individual cardiovascular disease risk factors and markers of inflammation in multiethnic samples. For example, insulin resistance was related to dyslipidemia in Asian Indians (5) and Japanese adults (6), to blood pressure in Asian Indians (5) and Chinese adults (7), to markers of inflammation in Caucasian (8), Hispanic, and African American adults (3,9), and to central obesity in Caucasian (10) and Japanese (6) adults. However, the majority of these studies included middle-aged, overweight, and obese subjects, with very few studies including young women, normal-weight women, or Hispanic women. Hispanic women have a lower insulin sensitivity (11) and higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome (12), type 2 diabetes (13), and cardiovascular disease risk factors (14,15) compared with non-Hispanic white women. Large population-based studies indicate that the presence of a single cardiovascular disease risk factor during young adulthood to middle age is associated with an increased lifetime risk for cardiovascular disease and lower survival rate (16,17).
