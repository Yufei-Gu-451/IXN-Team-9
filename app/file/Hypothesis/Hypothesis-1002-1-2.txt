Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common malignancy and the third most frequent cause of cancer death in the United States for overall population, although both incidence and mortality rates have declined in recent years (CressNone, 2006). Overweight and obesity proportions in Asian subgroups were much lower than in NHW (Table 3). Advance tumour stages were highly associated with worse DSS in each ethnicity group.
