The purpose of this analysis was to determine whether there are significant differences in presentation, clinicopathologic features, treatment, and survival rates between non-Hispanic white (NHW) and Asian; and between Asian subgroups in patients with CRC. Indian/Pakistani patients were the youngest at diagnosis (median age: 60.5 years) and Japanese patients were the oldest (median age: 71 years). However, most Asians in SEER are from California registries.
