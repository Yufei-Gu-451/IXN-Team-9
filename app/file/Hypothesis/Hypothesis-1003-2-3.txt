About 10% of these tumors are malignant and because the diagnosis of malignancy can only be made when they are located in non-chromaffin tissue sites, malignant pheochromocytomas are, by definition, metastatic[None,None]. The average coefficient of variation for measurement of the activity of a lesion was 3.3%. Post-chemotherapy, 30 lesions showed no MIBG uptake and 43 lesions persisted (26 showed decreased MIBG uptake, 3 had unchanged MIBG uptake, and 14 had increased MIBG uptake). [18F]Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET provides another modality for localization of metastatic pheochromocytoma, although with less tissue specificity than the other functional approaches targeting the catecholamine biosynthetic and storage pathways. [123I]MIBG is preferable to [131I]MIBG because it provides higher-quality images and the lower radiation burden of123I allows a higher permissible dose, resulting in a higher count rate.
