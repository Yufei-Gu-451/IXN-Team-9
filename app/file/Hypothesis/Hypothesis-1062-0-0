Approximately one-half of extremely premature infants (born less than =28 weeks of gestation) develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), and pulmonary hypertension (PHTN) in the preterm infant with BPD is an increasingly recognized problem. Approximately one-third of infants with BPD will have persistently elevated pulmonary arterial pressures associated with moderate to severe oxygen dependence, cardiopulmonary instability, and right heart dysfunction. PHTN in infants with BPD is also associated with greater morbidity and mortality, including more severe BPD, long-term mechanical ventilation support, poor growth and neurodevelopmental outcome. None,NoneThe development of PHTN in BPD is associated with a four-fold increased likelihood of death. NoneDespite the growing number of infants diagnosed with BPD-associated PHTN, little is known about the risk factors for this devastating disease.
