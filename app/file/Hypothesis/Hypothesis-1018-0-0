Approximately 40% of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have elevated urinary albumin excretion consistent with underlying renal disease, and greater than 17% of patients with diabetes have chronic kidney disease (CKD) (1). These patients have an increased risk of cardiovascular-related disease and death relative to those with normal renal function (2). Improved glycemic control in patients with T2DM and CKD is associated with positive clinical outcomes (3); however, antihyperglycemic treatment options for such patients are limited due to safety and tolerability concerns (4). Metformin is contraindicated in patients with T2DM whose creatinine clearance is less than 60 mL/min (5). Although select sulfonylureas may be used, these agents are associated with an increased incidence of hypoglycemia and weight gain (4,6-8). Consequently, many patients with T2DM and CKD do not achieve or maintain adequate glycemic control (6), underscoring the need for a therapeutic agent with significant glycemic efficacy but with a safety and tolerability profile that supports its use in this patient population. Sitagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, is a medication for patients with T2DM that improves glycemic control through enhancement of the incretin axis (9-11).
