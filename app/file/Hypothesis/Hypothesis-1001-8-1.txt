Sunitinib malate, an oral multitargeted inhibitor of VEGFRs, PDGFRs, stem cell factor receptor (KIT), and other RTKs (AbramsNone, 2003;MendelNone, 2003;O'FarrellNone, 2003a,2003b;FaivreNone, 2006), is approved for treatment of advanced RCC, imatinib-resistant gastrointestinal stromal tumour, and progressive, well-differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (DemetriNone, 2006;MotzerNone, 2006;MotzerNone, 2007;KulkeNone, 2008;RaymondNone, 2011;SUTENT (sunitinib malate) prescribing information (2012)). In addition, up to six additional patients could be included at specific dose levels on either schedule to further define the observed toxicity profile. One of eight patients on Schedule 4/2 experienced a DLT (grade 3 neutropenia) at the initial dose level of sunitinib 37.5 mg+gemcitabine 750 mg m-2, warranting further dose escalation. The gemcitabine dose was not modified in any patients. Haematological AEs were neutropenia (grade 3 (n=1) and grade 4 (n=2)) and leucopenia (grade 3 (n=2)). Treatment-related AEs (grade ?3) occurring among the 25 patients on Schedule 2/1, post-amendment, are detailed inTable 3. The slightly lower sunitinib and total drug Cmaxand AUC24values for sunitinib plus gemcitabine (i.e., on day 8) as compared with sunitinib alone (i.e., on day 15) is likely because of sunitinib and its metabolite not achieving complete steady-state levels by day 8 (sunitinib half-life is 40-86 h) (FaivreNone, 2006). Across all schedules and cohorts, 6/23 patients (26%) with RCC achieved a PR and 13 patients (57%) exhibited s.d. greater than 6 months. We conducted a phase I dose-escalation study of sunitinib combined with gemcitabine in patients with advanced solid tumours. Our results indicate that oral sunitinib given on Schedule 2/1 combined with IV gemcitabine given on days 1 and 8, with each agent at the maximum individual approved dose, has a favourable safety profile. This safety profile is similar to that reported in phase I trials of sunitinib in combination with other chemotherapy regimens, including docetaxel, capecitabine, pemetrexed, carboplatin plus paclitaxel, and gemcitabine (with and without cisplatin), in which most AEs were mild to moderate in studies including patients with all solid tumours or those restricted to NSCLC (SweeneyNone, 2007;ChowNone, 2008;HeathNone, 2008;TraynorNone, 2008;ReckNone, 2010;BrellNone, 2012;OkamotoNone, 2012). Our results suggest that the combination merits further investigation in pancreatic cancer and RCC. The antitumor activity observed in patients with poor-risk, high grade, or sarcomatoid RCC is noteworthy.
