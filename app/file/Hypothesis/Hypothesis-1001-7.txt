Extensive preclinical evidence suggests additive and/or synergistic effects in solid tumour models when a variety of chemotherapies, including gemcitabine, are combined with targeted agents, including sunitinib (YeeNone, 2004;CarterNone, 2007;ChristensenNone, 2008), as demonstrated in a recently reported phase I trial of sunitinib on a continuous daily dosing schedule plus gemcitabine in patients with advanced solid tumours (BrellNone, 2012). Median days on sunitinib treatment were 92, 84, and 83-254 (depending on the dose level), respectively, and the median relative dose intensity for sunitinib was 58.4, 72.9, and 77.4-100% (67.8, 75.0, and 87.6-100% for gemcitabine). Haematological AEs were neutropenia (grade 3 (n=1) and grade 4 (n=2)) and leucopenia (grade 3 (n=2)). Treatment-related AEs (grade ?3) occurring among the 25 patients on Schedule 2/1, post-amendment, are detailed inTable 3. A further 18 patients (41%), including 12 (48%) on schedule 2/1, post-amendment, had stable disease (s.d.) In the earlier phase I trial with gemcitabine, growth factor support was excluded and the recommended phase II dose was gemcitabine 675 mg m-2on days 1 and 8 and sunitinib 25 mg on continuous daily dosing (BrellNone, 2012). For example, the incidences of the most common grade 3 or 4 haematological toxicities associated with this combination (Schedule 2/1, post-amendment) were substantially higher than that with sunitinib monotherapy (in treatment-naive patients with metastatic RCC;SUTENT (sunitinib malate) prescribing information (2012)): neutropenia (52%vs17%, respectively), leucopenia (32%vs8%), lymphopenia (28%vs18%) and thrombocytopenia (28%vs9%). Our results also suggest that sunitinib combined with gemcitabine may be a more active regimen than gemcitabine-based chemotherapy, which has also shown limited activity in sarcomatoid RCC (StadlerNone, 2003;NanusNone, 2004). Phase II studies of this combination in patients with RCC or pancreatic cancer are underway.
