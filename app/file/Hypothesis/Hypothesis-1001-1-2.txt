Sunitinib malate, an oral multitargeted inhibitor of VEGFRs, PDGFRs, stem cell factor receptor (KIT), and other RTKs (AbramsNone, 2003;MendelNone, 2003;O'FarrellNone, 2003a,2003b;FaivreNone, 2006), is approved for treatment of advanced RCC, imatinib-resistant gastrointestinal stromal tumour, and progressive, well-differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (DemetriNone, 2006;MotzerNone, 2006;MotzerNone, 2007;KulkeNone, 2008;RaymondNone, 2011;SUTENT (sunitinib malate) prescribing information (2012)). Provision was made for dose reduction if patients experienced drug-related toxicities. Non-haematological DLTs were any drug-related grade 3 or 4 toxicities lasting ?7 days (except for grade 3/4 hyperamylasemia or hyperlipasemia without signs of pancreatitis, grade 4 hyperuricemia or grade 3/4 hypophosphatemia without clinical symptoms, or grade 3 asymptomatic hypertension), and nausea, vomiting, or diarrhoea persisting at grade 3 or 4 despite treatment. Two of eleven patients (18%) on Schedule 2/1, pre-amendment, had DLTs at the dose level of sunitinib 37.5 mg+gemcitabine 750 mg m-2(appendicitis/abscess and QTc prolongation). The gemcitabine dose was not modified in any patients. The slightly lower sunitinib and total drug Cmaxand AUC24values for sunitinib plus gemcitabine (i.e., on day 8) as compared with sunitinib alone (i.e., on day 15) is likely because of sunitinib and its metabolite not achieving complete steady-state levels by day 8 (sunitinib half-life is 40-86 h) (FaivreNone, 2006). Among 25 patients on Schedule 2/1, post amendment, PRs were observed in 7 patients across the full range of doses: two with pancreatic carcinoma and five with RCC. We conducted a phase I dose-escalation study of sunitinib combined with gemcitabine in patients with advanced solid tumours. The study design was modified on Schedule 2/1 to allow growth factor support during cycle 1. In the earlier phase I trial with gemcitabine, growth factor support was excluded and the recommended phase II dose was gemcitabine 675 mg m-2on days 1 and 8 and sunitinib 25 mg on continuous daily dosing (BrellNone, 2012). In addition, co-administration of sunitinib with gemcitabine did not appear to affect the PK of gemcitabine.
