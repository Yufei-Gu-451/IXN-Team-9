Patients were treated until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or consent withdrawal. Provision was made for dose reduction if patients experienced drug-related toxicities. Missed doses of day 8 gemcitabine were not made up. The gemcitabine dose was not modified in any patients. The study design was modified on Schedule 2/1 to allow growth factor support during cycle 1. Phase II studies of this combination in patients with RCC or pancreatic cancer are underway.
