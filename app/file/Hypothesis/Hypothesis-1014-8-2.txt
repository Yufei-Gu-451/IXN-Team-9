Physician visit, hospitalization, and ambulatory care costs are available for the entire cohort. Drug costs were excluded for all patients in this primary outcome. In patients greater than 65 years of age, two-thirds had filled a prescription for one or more oral antidiabetic medication at baseline (62.2%), and approximately one-fifth (17.4%) of patients were on insulin. Among patients less than 65 years of age, those with unmeasured HbA1cwere less likely to have comorbid illness, possibly suggesting that some of the unmeasured patients were misclassified. Medications accounted for $10,000 or approximately one-quarter of the 5-year medical costs for people greater than 65 years of age; the mean cumulative 5-year cost for this group, including drug costs, was CDN $44,511 (IQR $13,758-56,333) per patient. 1). Patients who had no proteinuria had an adjusted mean cost of $24,531 per patient compared with $46,836 for patients with heavy proteinuria. The model estimates that patients with an eGFR of 15 mL/min have average 5-year costs $91,419 higher compared with a patient with no renal impairment (eGFR 90 mL/min), patients with heavy proteinuria have costs $22,305 higher per patient compared with those with no proteinuria, and patients with inadequate glycemic control had costs $5,565 higher per patient compared with those with good glycemic control. Costs were also positively associated with age, Aboriginal status, lower socioeconomic status, duration of diabetes, and Charlson comorbidity index. This represents ?12.5% of total health care spending in Canada, which was estimated at $200 billion annually in 2011 (29). Similarly, Gilmer et al. Although this study does not provide direct evidence that improvements in diabetes management would lead to cost reductions, our findings demonstrate a clear association between increased cost and suboptimal glycemic control and markers of kidney disease. Although we controlled for all available confounders, including age, sex, socioeconomic status, and comorbid illness, we were not able to control for other potentially important variables, including ethnicity and education. Future studies should assess whether strategies to improve these laboratory measures lead to reduced costs.
