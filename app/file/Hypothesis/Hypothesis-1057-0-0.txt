Hypoglycemia among hospitalized patients is a common problem. In previous studies, 7-10% of the patients admitted to the hospital were reported to have at least one episode of hypoglycemia (1,2). Most of these hypoglycemic episodes were treatment related, but spontaneous hypoglycemia is also known to be frequent (1).
