The drastic increase in patients with MetS has been now recognized as a medical and public health crisis in the world. Lower aerobic capacity is one of the strongest and independent predictors of all-cause mortality in subjects with obesity and insulin resistance (2,3), and it is essential to improve lower aerobic capacity in the treatment of MetS. Moreover, it has been reported that intramyocellular lipid (IMCL) is accumulated in patients with MetS, which is mainly due to impaired fatty acid oxidation in the skeletal muscle rather than increased uptake of fatty acid into the skeletal muscle (8,9). In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that systemic oxidative stress is associated with lower aerobic capacity and impaired skeletal muscle energy metabolism in patients with MetS. Body weight, BMI, percent fat, and waist circumference were significantly higher in patients with MetS than control subjects (Table 1). Moreover, serum total thiols and SOD activity were significantly lower in patients with MetS than control subjects (Fig. In contrast, AT normalized to body weight had close relationships with both serum TBARS and systemic antioxidant defense capacity (Fig. Recent large clinical trials have demonstrated that systemic oxidative stress is related to insulin resistance and obesity (15,16), which is consistent with our results that there were tight correlations between serum TBARS and insulin resistance markers such as FBS, insulin level, or free fatty acid level (Supplementary Fig. In summary, we demonstrated for the first time that systemic oxidative stress including higher levels of lipid peroxidation and lower antioxidant defense capacity was related to lower aerobic capacity and impaired skeletal muscle energy metabolism in patients with MetS.
