Obesity management during pregnancy includes recommendations of appropriate weight gain. Additionally, we investigated whether it seems safe to advise this group of women to gain less than =5 kg regarding maternal health, including diabetes management, and pregnancy outcomes. The main outcome variable was birth weightzscore. In those treated with oral antidiabetic drugs (usually metformin) at first visit, this treatment was discontinued. Women gaining less than =5 kg had a lower median prepregnancy BMI and higher median diastolic blood pressure at first visit compared with the remaining women (Table 1). Pregnancy-related outcomesIn the multiple linear regression analysis, a gestational weight gain of less than =5 kg was significantly associated with a lower birth weightzscore when adjusted for prepregnancy BMI, smoking, HbA1cat last visit, ethnicity, preeclampsia, and nulliparity, (beta = -0.978 [95% CI -1.831 to -0.126],P= 0.025), corresponding to a one SD lower birth weight. Therefore, it is encouraging that the prevalence of women with morning ketonuria was very low and comparable in the two groups. Lower gestational weight gain in women with the highest pregestational BMI, as previously found in obese women without diabetes (15), was not present in our material, where women who gained less than =5 kg were less obese before their current pregnancy than those who gained more.
