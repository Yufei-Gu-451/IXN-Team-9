The drastic increase in patients with MetS has been now recognized as a medical and public health crisis in the world. Recent studies have shown that impaired mitochondrial function in the skeletal muscle may be involved in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance (5-7). Recently, we demonstrated that increased IMCL was associated with lower aerobic capacity and impaired intramuscular high-energy phosphate metabolism in patients with MetS (10). In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that systemic oxidative stress is associated with lower aerobic capacity and impaired skeletal muscle energy metabolism in patients with MetS. The protocol was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Hokkaido University Hospital, and written informed consent was obtained from all participating subjects. Data are expressed as means +/- SD. Statistical analysis was performed using StatView software (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC), andP less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. We previously demonstrated that NAD(P)H oxidase-derived O2-production was significantly increased in the skeletal muscle from high-fat diet-induced diabetic mice in association with lower aerobic capacity and mitochondrial dysfunction in the skeletal muscle, and inhibition of NAD(P)H oxidase ameliorated these impairments (27). Therefore, ROS derived from NAD(P)H oxidase may play a crucial role in increased oxidative damage in the skeletal muscle in patients with MetS. Recent large clinical trials have demonstrated that systemic oxidative stress is related to insulin resistance and obesity (15,16), which is consistent with our results that there were tight correlations between serum TBARS and insulin resistance markers such as FBS, insulin level, or free fatty acid level (Supplementary Fig. First, we could not completely eliminate the possibility of type II error in some of the correlation analyses.
