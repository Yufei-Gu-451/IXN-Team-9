Therapeutic inhibition of tumour angiogenesis and multiple signalling pathways associated with tumour development (e.g., pathways controlled by vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs) and platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs)) results in clinically meaningful antitumor activity, as demonstrated across multiple tumour types, including colon cancer, pancreatic carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma (RCC), breast cancer (BC) and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (HurwitzNone, 2005;SandlerNone, 2006;MillerNone, 2007;BursteinNone, 2008;ManegoldNone, 2008;EscudierNone, 2009). Patients were excluded if previously treated with gemcitabine or sunitinib; had severe/unstable angina, myocardial infarction, symptomatic congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular accident, or transient ischaemic attack within the previous 12 months; National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE, version 3.0) grade 3 haemorrhage within 4 weeks of study entry; uncontrolled hypertension; uncontrolled brain metastases; and a second malignancy diagnosis within the last 5 years. Non-haematological DLTs were any drug-related grade 3 or 4 toxicities lasting ?7 days (except for grade 3/4 hyperamylasemia or hyperlipasemia without signs of pancreatitis, grade 4 hyperuricemia or grade 3/4 hypophosphatemia without clinical symptoms, or grade 3 asymptomatic hypertension), and nausea, vomiting, or diarrhoea persisting at grade 3 or 4 despite treatment. Non-haematological treatment-related AEs included: grade 4 uric acid elevation (n=2), hypertension, pulmonary embolism, and cerebrovascular accident (n=1 each), grade 3 elevation of amylase (n=2) or lipase (n=1), hypertension, pericardial effusion, leukoencephalopathy, nausea, mucosal inflammation, hypophosphatemia, and hypomagnesemia (eachn=1). For example, the incidences of the most common grade 3 or 4 haematological toxicities associated with this combination (Schedule 2/1, post-amendment) were substantially higher than that with sunitinib monotherapy (in treatment-naive patients with metastatic RCC;SUTENT (sunitinib malate) prescribing information (2012)): neutropenia (52%vs17%, respectively), leucopenia (32%vs8%), lymphopenia (28%vs18%) and thrombocytopenia (28%vs9%). This treatment regimen has promising antitumor activity, surpassing that shown in the earlier gemcitabine phase I combination trial, in which 4 of 33 patients had a PR (BrellNone, 2012).
