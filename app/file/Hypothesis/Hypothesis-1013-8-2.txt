In brief, a 16-gauge peripheral venous cannula was inserted into the left antecubital vein for infusion of glucose and insulin, and a second cannula was inserted for blood sampling more distally. Renal function, blood pressure, and circulating cGMP measurements were assessed at the end of eachl-NMMA infusion period. *P= 0.012 for the effect of hyperglycemia on plasma cGMP in men compared with women. The effect ofl-arginine on plasma cGMP during clamped hyperglycemia in men and women with uncomplicated type 1 DM (mean +/- SD). Our major observations included that expected increases in GFR and FF in response to clamped hyperglycemia were associated with exaggerated declines in cGMP in women. Also, in women, administration ofl-arginine reduced GFR and FF but not SBP, back toward values observed during clamped euglycemic conditions. The goal of the current study was to determine if NO synthase activation withl-arginine would reverse sex-dependent renal hemodynamic and blood pressure differences in the response to clamped hyperglycemia in type 1 DM patients. This finding suggests that exaggerated hyperglycemia-induced renal effects observed in DM women are partly related to a decline in NO bioactivity (3). During clamped hyperglycemia, however,l-arginine increased cGMP but did not influence blood pressure. Our study does have limitations.
