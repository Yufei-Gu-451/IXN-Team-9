tumours) with more impeded water diffusion tend to maintain their signal at higherbvalues ( greater than 500 s mm-2). Visual assessment of DW-MR images is useful in disease detection and lesion characterization based on differential signal attenuation within tissues. Cystic or necrotic tissues show greater signal attenuation on higherbvalues and return higher ADC values. tumours) are often heterogeneous and thus result in poorer measurement reproducibility compared with normal tissues[None]. Several studies have shown that the cirrhotic liver is associated with lower ADC values than normal liver parenchyma (Fig. NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneStudies comparing DWI with T2-weighted imaging for the detection of focal liver lesionsStudies comparing DWI with contrast-enhanced MRI for the detection of focal liver lesionsDTPA, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid; EOB, ethoxybenzyl; Mn-DPDP, mangafodipir trisodium; SPIO, superparamagnetic iron oxide; TSE, turbo spin-echo. In cirrhotic liver, HCC (arrows) typically (a) demonstrates hyperenhancement in the arterial phase of low molecular weight Gd contrast-enhanced imaging; (b) appears relatively hypointense to liver in the portovenous or interstitial phase of contrast enhancement (washout) and (c) shows impeded diffusion on diffusion-weighted imaging (b = 500 s mm-2). Studies have been carried out on both primary and metastatic hepatic lesions to assess treatment-related DW-MRI changes. For example, studies have shown that using IVIM analysis, cirrhotic liver shows a lower perfusion fraction and pseudodiffusion coefficient. There are convincing data available to show that DW-MRI contributes to focal liver lesion detection and the assessment of treatment response.
