In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that systemic oxidative stress is associated with lower aerobic capacity and impaired skeletal muscle energy metabolism in patients with MetS. Skeletal muscle energy metabolismIMCL content was higher in patients with MetS than control subjects (Table 2). 2None). There were also relationships between skeletal muscle energy metabolism and some indices of systemic oxidative stress (Fig. Linear relation between systemic oxidative stress and aerobic capacity or skeletal muscle energy metabolism in control subjects (white circles) and MetS patients (black circles). There was a close relationship between systemic oxidative stress and impaired skeletal muscle energy metabolism (Fig. Recent large clinical trials have demonstrated that systemic oxidative stress is related to insulin resistance and obesity (15,16), which is consistent with our results that there were tight correlations between serum TBARS and insulin resistance markers such as FBS, insulin level, or free fatty acid level (Supplementary Fig. Because fatty acids are particularly prone to oxidative damage, lipid peroxidation products are easily formed in the skeletal muscle under the condition of increased ROS production, which can cause mitochondrial damage and subsequently decrease capacity for fatty acid oxidation (29). Therefore, an elaborate interdependency on mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress may cause a catastrophic cycle in the skeletal muscle in patients with MetS, which can lead to further deterioration of aerobic capacity as well as insulin resistance.
