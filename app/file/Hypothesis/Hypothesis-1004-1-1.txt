Therefore, increasingbvalues result in greater signal attenuation in less cellular areas, e.g. Therefore lesions may appear to show impeded diffusion on the highbvalue images (i.e. This provides the 95% confidence limits of the ADC measurement variation on a per patient basis. Selected publications on the use of DWI for the assessment of liver cirrhosis. A wider distribution in histogram values leads to a larger entropy ADC value. Table 2summarizes published papers utilizing DW-MRI for the assessment of liver fibrosis. Significant hepatic steatosis has been shown to lower hepatic ADC values. However, benign lesions have been shown to have higher (i.e. This ADC increase was not seen in lesions that showed no change or disease progression[None]. Prediction of which tumours will respond to treatment before onset could bring considerable clinical benefit.
