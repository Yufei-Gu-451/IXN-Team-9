At the renal microvascular level, we have demonstrated that clamped hyperglycemia is associated with renal hyperfiltration responses in women but not in men (2). Accordingly, our aim was to determine ifl-arginine, which is the substrate for NO synthase, would reverse sex-dependent renal hemodynamic and blood pressure differences in the response to clamped hyperglycemia in patients with uncomplicated type 1 DM. Plasma insulin levels were measured using standard techniques (18). *P= 0.012 for the effect of hyperglycemia on plasma cGMP in men compared with women. As expected, SBP did not change in either group in response tol-arginine during clamped hyperglycemia. The goal of this study was to determine if the administration of anl-arginine infusion to augment NO synthesis would reverse the exaggerated pressor response to clamped hyperglycemia in women with type 1 DM. Also, in women, administration ofl-arginine reduced GFR and FF but not SBP, back toward values observed during clamped euglycemic conditions. Our data therefore suggest that women exhibit enhanced NO bioactivity in the postglomerular circulation at baseline during clamped euglycemia; clamped hyperglycemia alone quenches postglomerular NO, leading to an increase in GFR and FF with lesser effects on ERPF, and these effects are reversible with infusion ofl-arginine. During clamped hyperglycemia, however,l-arginine increased cGMP but did not influence blood pressure. l-arginine reverses the renal hyperfiltration effect of hyperglycemia in women, suggesting that NO is an important contributor to the regulation of normal vascular function in women with type 1 DM.
