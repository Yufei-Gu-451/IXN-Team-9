Another concern is the lack of capacity to assess multiple diseases simultaneously (25). Data from the 1,748 patients with type 2 diabetes in the Japan Diabetes Complications Study (JDCS) (26) and the Japanese Elderly Diabetes Intervention Trial (J-EDIT) (27) provide an opportunity to develop a comprehensive risk engine for Asian patients with type 2 diabetes. The aim of the current study was therefore to develop and validate an algorithm that separately calculates each risk of the first occurrence for five events: fatal and nonfatal CHD, fatal and nonfatal stroke, noncardiovascular mortality, overt nephropathy, and progression of retinopathy. In the JDCS, 2,033 Japanese type 2 diabetes patients 40-70 years of age whose HbA1clevels were greater than =7.0% were randomized to a conventional treatment group and a lifestyle intervention group; throughout the paper, we present the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program value of HbA1ccalculated as follows: 0.25 + 1.02 * JDC value (29). The disease states and transitions assumed in the multistate model are detailed inSupplementary Data. Their mean baseline values indicated that the subjects had good control of weight (BMI = 23.2 +/- 3.1 kg/m2; waist circumference = 80.3 +/- 9.6 cm), blood pressure (SBP = 132.9 +/- 16.0 mmHg), and serum cholesterol levels (NHDL-C = 3.78 +/- 0.90 mmol/L; LDL cholesterol = 3.16 +/- 0.82 mmol/L; HDL cholesterol = 1.43 +/- 0.44 mmol/L; triglycerides = 1.39 +/- 0.88 mmol/L). In contrast, the UKPDS risk engine overestimated CHD risk, and this tendency is consistent with a previous report in Asian patients (18). A recent cohort study in Japan also suggested that the progression of the albuminuria stage is a risk factor of CVD (37). The risk equation from the Swedish National Diabetes Register incorporates the use of antihypertensive drugs and lipid-lowering drugs as predictors (9). Fourth, data on peripheral arterial disease and hemoglobin levels were not available. Finally, we defined overt nephropathy as the presence of persistent proteinuria, since an elevated urinary albumin excretion due to nondiabetic renal lesions or conditions is not rare.
