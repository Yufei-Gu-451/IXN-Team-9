Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) often experience worsening of their quality-of-life because of the long-term complications of the disease and the lifelong use of polypharmacy. Despite the use of pharmacotherapy, many T2DM patients do not attain or maintain adequate control of blood glucose levels (1). Therefore, there is still a need for novel glucose-lowering drugs that may extend the armamentarium for the treatment of T2DM. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a new class of glucose-lowering agents (2). SGLT2 is a low-affinity, high-capacity glucose transporter located in the proximal tubules of the kidneys that accounts for ?90% of glucose reabsorption (3-5). Inhibition of SGLT2 results in an increase of urinary glucose excretion, thereby improving glycemic control in T2DM patients (6). Ipragliflozin (ASP1941) is an oral, potent, and selective SGLT2 inhibitor in phase 3 development for the treatment of T2DM.
