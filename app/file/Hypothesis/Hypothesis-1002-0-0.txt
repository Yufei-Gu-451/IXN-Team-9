Asian Americans constitute the fastest growing ethnic group in the United States (American community survey, 2007). Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common malignancy and the third most frequent cause of cancer death in the United States for overall population, although both incidence and mortality rates have declined in recent years (CressNone, 2006). Some studies have discussed the incidence of and mortality rates differences between Asian Americans and other ethnic groups, but few examined disparities among Asian subgroup populations (ChienNone, 2005;WhiteNone, 2010).
