The treatment of pregnant women with type 2 diabetes tends to focus on achieving euglycemia, before, during, and after pregnancy (8). In pregnant women without diabetes, obesity is associated with complications such as perinatal mortality and LGA/macrosomia, the risk rising with rising prepregnancy BMI (9,10). Obesity management during pregnancy includes recommendations of appropriate weight gain. Based on results from a study in obese women without diabetes (15), since 2008, the procedure in our clinic for pregnant women with diabetes has been to advise obese (BMI greater than =30 kg/m2) women with type 2 diabetes to gain 0-5 kg in total during pregnancy in an attempt to minimize the frequency of LGA infants. The main outcome variable was birth weightzscore. Therefore, it is encouraging that the prevalence of women with morning ketonuria was very low and comparable in the two groups. We did not find an increased rate of SGA infants among women gaining less than =5 kg, and all these women received insulin treatment. Another possible bias arises from the women who delivered preterm being included in the study (n= 13); obviously, these women had a shorter pregnancy in which to gain weight than those who delivered at term.
