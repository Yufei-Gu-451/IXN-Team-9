Accordingly, our aim was to determine ifl-arginine, which is the substrate for NO synthase, would reverse sex-dependent renal hemodynamic and blood pressure differences in the response to clamped hyperglycemia in patients with uncomplicated type 1 DM. Renal function and circulating cGMP measurements were assessed at the end of eachl-arginine infusion period, as described in previous experiments (6). Plasma insulin levels were measured using standard techniques (18). *P= 0.012 for the effect of hyperglycemia on plasma cGMP in men compared with women. As expected, SBP did not change in either group in response tol-arginine during clamped hyperglycemia. There was no impact on these measures in men. The goal of the current study was to determine if NO synthase activation withl-arginine would reverse sex-dependent renal hemodynamic and blood pressure differences in the response to clamped hyperglycemia in type 1 DM patients. Our data therefore suggest that women exhibit enhanced NO bioactivity in the postglomerular circulation at baseline during clamped euglycemia; clamped hyperglycemia alone quenches postglomerular NO, leading to an increase in GFR and FF with lesser effects on ERPF, and these effects are reversible with infusion ofl-arginine. The resulting decline in NO bioactivity may, in part, explain the blunted systemic arterial response to NO synthase blockade with L-NAME in female rats with DM compared with male rats with DM (28). During clamped hyperglycemia, however,l-arginine increased cGMP but did not influence blood pressure.
