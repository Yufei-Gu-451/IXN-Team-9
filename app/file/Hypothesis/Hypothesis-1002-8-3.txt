The purpose of this analysis was to determine whether there are significant differences in presentation, clinicopathologic features, treatment, and survival rates between non-Hispanic white (NHW) and Asian; and between Asian subgroups in patients with CRC. Information on the prevalence of selected lifestyle factors for cancer and the use of CRC screening tests (colonoscopy and faecal occult blood testing) were derived from the 2009 California Health Interview Survey (CHIS) data using the askCHIS tool (http://ask.chis.ucla.edu/main/default.asp, access date: 17 February 2012). Alcohol use was much higher in NHW men (39.9%) and Korean men (36.5%).
