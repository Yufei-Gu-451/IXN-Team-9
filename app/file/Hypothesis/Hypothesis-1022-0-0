In the search for modifiable risk factors related to unhealthy weight, a growing literature has focused on the influence of neighborhood deprivation. Neighborhood deprivation may affect weight through differential access to safe places to exercise (1) and nutritious foods (2) or through chronic environmental stressors (3,4). Cross-sectional studies have found positive associations between neighborhood deprivation and unhealthy weight (5,6). However, longitudinal studies, which provide a stronger basis for causation, have yielded mixed results, with some finding no association (6) and others finding a positive association (7,8) between neighborhood deprivation and weight change. These inconsistencies may be a result of differences in study populations, length of follow-up, or specification of neighborhood deprivation (9,10). However, they may also be the result of failure to take into account the complexity of weight change, particularly among adults with chronic conditions like diabetes. In such populations, in which most individuals are trying to lose weight, the spectrum of possible outcomes includes weight loss, gain, fluctuation (i.e., loss and regain), and stability (11).
