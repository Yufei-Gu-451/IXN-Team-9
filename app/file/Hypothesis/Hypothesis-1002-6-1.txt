Ethnicity was categorised into two broad groups: NHW and Asians (including Pacific Islanders). Patients not experiencing this end point were censored at last follow-up. Most Asian subgroups (Indian/Pakistani, HR 0.68,P less than 0.0001, Chinese, HR 0.94,P=0.025, and Japanese HR 0.93,P=0.006,), except Hawaiian (HR 1.2,P less than 0.0001), had better DSS than did NHW patients.
