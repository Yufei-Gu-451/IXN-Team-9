C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) is a member of the natriuretic peptide family and has been demonstrated to be abundantly present in the brain, interestingly in discrete hypothalamic areas, such as the arcuate nucleus (ARC) of the hypothalamus, that play pivotal roles in energy regulation (1-3). Two predominant molecular forms of CNP in the porcine brain were reported to be a 22-residue peptide (CNP-22) and itsN-terminally elongated 53-residue peptide (CNP-53) (1). Moreover, natriuretic peptide receptor-B (NPR-B), a CNP receptor, is also widely distributed in the brain and is reported to be abundantly expressed in the ARC of the hypothalamus (4,5). These findings indicate the possibility that the brain CNP/NPR-B system may regulate energy homeostasis. In the current study, we examined the effects of intracerebroventricular administration of CNP on food intake induced by refeeding after fasting and by orexigenic peptides, such as neuropeptide Y (NPY) and ghrelin. Also, we examined the involvement of the melanocortin system in the CNP actions.
