Targeting PDGF and VEGF signalling pathways with sunitinib plus gemcitabine may enhance antitumor activity compared with either agent alone. Extensive preclinical evidence suggests additive and/or synergistic effects in solid tumour models when a variety of chemotherapies, including gemcitabine, are combined with targeted agents, including sunitinib (YeeNone, 2004;CarterNone, 2007;ChristensenNone, 2008), as demonstrated in a recently reported phase I trial of sunitinib on a continuous daily dosing schedule plus gemcitabine in patients with advanced solid tumours (BrellNone, 2012). Provision was made for dose reduction if patients experienced drug-related toxicities. Non-haematological DLTs were any drug-related grade 3 or 4 toxicities lasting ?7 days (except for grade 3/4 hyperamylasemia or hyperlipasemia without signs of pancreatitis, grade 4 hyperuricemia or grade 3/4 hypophosphatemia without clinical symptoms, or grade 3 asymptomatic hypertension), and nausea, vomiting, or diarrhoea persisting at grade 3 or 4 despite treatment. One of eight patients on Schedule 4/2 experienced a DLT (grade 3 neutropenia) at the initial dose level of sunitinib 37.5 mg+gemcitabine 750 mg m-2, warranting further dose escalation. The gemcitabine dose was not modified in any patients. The most common grade 3 or 4 haematological toxicities related to sunitinib plus gemcitabine treatment in patients on Schedule 2/1, post-amendment, were neutropenia (n=13), leucopenia (n=8), and lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia (bothn=7). Our results indicate that oral sunitinib given on Schedule 2/1 combined with IV gemcitabine given on days 1 and 8, with each agent at the maximum individual approved dose, has a favourable safety profile. The study design was modified on Schedule 2/1 to allow growth factor support during cycle 1. In addition, co-administration of sunitinib with gemcitabine did not appear to affect the PK of gemcitabine.
