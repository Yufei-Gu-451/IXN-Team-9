Gliomas are the most common brain tumors and account for 70% of primary adult malignant brain tumors[None]. There have been reports that the incidence of gliomas has been increasing in recent years and some studies have inconclusively linked this to increased cell phone usage[None]. The World Health Organization (WHO) categorizes gliomas into grades I to IV, with grade I being benign and grade IV most malignant[None]. The importance of glioma grading lies in the fact that it is the most important prognostic factor for the patient. Benign tumors are often amenable to surgery, whereas malignant tumors have to be frequently managed with radiochemotherapy and indicate a low survival rate. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is the initial investigation of choice in patients with suspected glioma and plays a major role in the initial differential, but currently, no imaging features are considered in the confirmatory diagnosis or grading of gliomas; these are solely based on invasive stereotactic biopsies[None]. In the previous decade, MR imaging has become the mainstay diagnostic tool for the evaluation of suspected brain tumors preoperatively and follow-up after therapy. The strength of MR imaging lies in its vast array of sequences, which do not just anatomically delineate lesions (t1, t2) but also differentiate them physiologically[None]. The susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) sequence is a useful recent addition to this arsenal of MR imaging sequences; it has been designed to utilize the susceptibility difference between the deoxygenated blood in veins and the surrounding brain parenchyma to provide a high degree of contrast[None]. Information attained via structural MR imaging scans in patients with glioma, such as the accurate anatomic location and the relationship of the tumor with important surrounding brain structures, has major influences on the therapeutic decisions.
