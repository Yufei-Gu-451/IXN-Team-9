[18F]Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET provides another modality for localization of metastatic pheochromocytoma, although with less tissue specificity than the other functional approaches targeting the catecholamine biosynthetic and storage pathways. Physical examination is useful for assessing lymph node changes and should always be included in follow-up evaluations. In particular, this patient had 37 sites of disease identified by MIBG imaging; after 4.1 months of chemotherapy, MIBG uptake decreased in 13 lesions and disappeared in another 12. Similar findings were also observed in 2 other patients in our population, showing 3 (patient 1) and 1 (patient 4) lesions with increased MIBG uptake after chemotherapy. These tumor sites with increased MIBG activity were further evaluated by radiography and were found to be expanding lesions requiring radiation therapy. [123I]MIBG is preferable to [131I]MIBG because it provides higher-quality images and the lower radiation burden of123I allows a higher permissible dose, resulting in a higher count rate.
