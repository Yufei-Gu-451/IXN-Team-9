Some studies have discussed the incidence of and mortality rates differences between Asian Americans and other ethnic groups, but few examined disparities among Asian subgroup populations (ChienNone, 2005;WhiteNone, 2010). Differences in tumour site distribution and genetics may explain the high survival rates observed among Asians. In contrast to the decreasing trends in CRC incidence reported among all major racial/ethnic groups, CRC rates are actually increasing among some Asian subgroups, including the Korean population (GiddingsNone, 2012).
