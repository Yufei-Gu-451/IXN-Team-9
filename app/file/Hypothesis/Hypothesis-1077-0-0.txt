Subcutaneous adipose tissue (SCAT) is a complex metabolic organ that responds dynamically to alterations in nutritional state. As the tissue expands, macrophages infiltrate and orchestrate inflammatory responses via molecules such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1, all of which have been implicated in pathological changes in AT physiology (1,2). Hypoxia within the tissue has been proposed as an underlying cause of AT dysfunction, moving the tissue toward a proinflammatory phenotype (3-5). Tissue O2partial pressure (pO2) reflects the balance between O2delivery and consumption. AT blood flow (ATBF) plays an integral role in oxygen supply. It is markedly lower in obese than in nonobese subjects in both the fasted (6-9) and postprandial (6,8) states. Thus, in obese individuals it could be anticipated that oxygen delivery to the tissue is compromised. Beyond this, it is also well established that expansion of fat tissue often leads to larger cells (6), increasing the diffusion distance for O2. The level of oxygen deficiency within human AT that defines hypoxia remains unclear. Direct measurements of AT pO2have been made in murine and human models. Ye et al. (4) reported a 70% lower interstitial pO2within epididymal fat pads ofob/obcompared with lean mice (4). The pO2of obese AT is reported to be significantly lower than nonobese AT in most (10-12) but not all studies.
