The importance of glycemic control in type 2 diabetes is well-recognized because strict glycemic control decreases the incidence and progression of diabetic microvascular and macrovascular complications (1-3). However, recent, large, prospective, clinical trials showing the clinical outcomes of intensive glucose-lowering treatment observed increased risk of severe hypoglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes, and hypoglycemia is regarded as the main barrier to achieving optimal glycemic targets in patients with type 2 diabetes (4-6). During strict glycemic control, hypoglycemia is an inevitable clinical problem in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, and all diabetic patients are exposed to the risk of hypoglycemia as long as they use glucose-lowering treatment. Hypoglycemia can impact patient quality of life, deter the pursuit of lowering blood glucose to the target range, and increase the risk of sustaining acute vascular events in patients with comorbidities (7). The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial and the Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron Modified Release Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE) study have shown that intensive glucose control led to increases in macrovascular disease and cardiovascular events, although HbA1creached the target range, and hypoglycemia is supposed to contribute to the increased cardiovascular mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes (4,5). Therefore, prevention of hypoglycemic events and early detection of patients at high risk for hypoglycemia has important clinical implications in patients with diabetes.
