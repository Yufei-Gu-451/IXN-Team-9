If ANC was less than 500 cells per mm3, then the gemcitabine dose was held. Eleven patients total (all on Schedule 2/1) received growth factor support, including one patient before the amendment. Following the amendment allowing growth factor support, no further protocol-defined DLTs were observed. The sunitinib dose was interrupted in 25 patients and reduced in 12 patients across all cohorts. The study design was modified on Schedule 2/1 to allow growth factor support during cycle 1. Phase II studies of this combination in patients with RCC or pancreatic cancer are underway.
