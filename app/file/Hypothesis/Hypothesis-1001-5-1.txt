Therapeutic inhibition of tumour angiogenesis and multiple signalling pathways associated with tumour development (e.g., pathways controlled by vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs) and platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs)) results in clinically meaningful antitumor activity, as demonstrated across multiple tumour types, including colon cancer, pancreatic carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma (RCC), breast cancer (BC) and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (HurwitzNone, 2005;SandlerNone, 2006;MillerNone, 2007;BursteinNone, 2008;ManegoldNone, 2008;EscudierNone, 2009). When combined with chemotherapy, antiangiogenic therapies may provide effective treatment of historically treatment-resistant solid tumours (HurwitzNone, 2005;SandlerNone, 2006;MillerNone, 2007;ManegoldNone, 2008). Thus, treatment that specifically interrupts tumour vasculature through inhibition of various important receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signalling pathways, combined with a chemotherapy, may be of interest. Sunitinib malate, an oral multitargeted inhibitor of VEGFRs, PDGFRs, stem cell factor receptor (KIT), and other RTKs (AbramsNone, 2003;MendelNone, 2003;O'FarrellNone, 2003a,2003b;FaivreNone, 2006), is approved for treatment of advanced RCC, imatinib-resistant gastrointestinal stromal tumour, and progressive, well-differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (DemetriNone, 2006;MotzerNone, 2006;MotzerNone, 2007;KulkeNone, 2008;RaymondNone, 2011;SUTENT (sunitinib malate) prescribing information (2012)). In phase I and II trials, sunitinib has also shown antitumor activity in patients with other advanced solid tumours, including BC, NSCLC, neuroendocrine tumour, sarcoma, thyroid cancer and melanoma (RosenNone, 2003;FaivreNone, 2006;BursteinNone, 2008;SocinskiNone, 2008). Gemcitabine is a nucleoside analogue that primarily targets cells undergoing DNA synthesis (S-phase) and also blocks progression of cells through the G1/S-phase boundary.
