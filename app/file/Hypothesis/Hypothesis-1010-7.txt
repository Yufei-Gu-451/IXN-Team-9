These reports raise the possibility that systemic oxidative stress may contribute to lower aerobic capacity and skeletal muscle dysfunction in patients with MetS. In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that systemic oxidative stress is associated with lower aerobic capacity and impaired skeletal muscle energy metabolism in patients with MetS. To monitor the level of physical activity during daily life, daily steps and movement-related calorie consumption were measured for at least 1 week by using a pedometer with an accelerometry sensor (Lifecorder Plus; Suzuken, Nagoya, Japan), as previously described (10). After at least 30 min rest, high-energy phosphate metabolism in the calf muscle was measured during plantar flexion exercise in supine position on the original apparatus equipped with a 1.5-Tesla whole-body scanner system (Magnetom Vision VB33G; Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) using31P-MRS, as previously described (10). Serum TBARS were measured by fluorometric analysis using a GENios Pro (Tecan Group Ltd., Mannedorf, Switzerland), as previously described (20). Data are expressed as means +/- SD. Moreover, to determine the association between oxidative stress and aerobic capacity of a large effect size (i.e.,r= 0.5), a sample size of total 27 subjects was needed to yield efficient power (1-beta = 0.8) based on alpha = 0.05. Fasting blood glucose, plasma insulin, HOMA-IR, HbA1c, and triglycerides were significantly elevated, and HDL cholesterol was significantly decreased in patients with MetS (Table 1). 1None). 1NoneandNone). 2). Recent large clinical trials have demonstrated that systemic oxidative stress is related to insulin resistance and obesity (15,16), which is consistent with our results that there were tight correlations between serum TBARS and insulin resistance markers such as FBS, insulin level, or free fatty acid level (Supplementary Fig.
