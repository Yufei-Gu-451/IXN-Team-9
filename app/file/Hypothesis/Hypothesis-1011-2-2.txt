Participants brought all prescription medicines to their assessment visits. Analyses included all randomized participants according to intervention assignment. Of the participants taking ADMs, 73% took SSRIs, SNRIs, or serotonin modulators, 28% took norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors, and 23% took TCA or tetracyclic agents at some point during the 4-year follow-up. ORs for CVD risk factor-positive status with ADM use or BDI greater than =11 the preceding year, controlled for risk factor status in the prior yearIn the DSE cohort, ADM use in the prior year was associated with more prevalent low HDL/medicine use (1.20 [1.03-1.50]), elevated TC/medicine use (1.29 [1.05-1.57]), and current smoking (1.70 [1.04-2.88]). We found little evidence for a temporal relationship between elevated depression symptoms and subsequent increases in positive CVD risk factor status. All CVD risk factor measures for which we found statistically significant associations with prior ADM use, except for HDL-cholesterol, have well documented associations with CVD morbidity and mortality. The literature on the effects of ADMs on CVD risk factors does not provide a clear explanation for our findings. We found that the associations of depression symptoms and ADM use with CVD risk factors were independent of one another. Although the clinical relevance of the associations we report is difficult to assess, we found a dramatic increase of 24 to greater than 50% in the odds of positive status for some CVD risk factors in study participants who had elevated depression symptoms or who were taking an ADM in the preceding year. In conclusion, among Look AHEAD participants, elevated self-reported depression symptoms and ADM use in the prior year were each independently associated with some but not all CVD risk factors during the first 4 years of the trial; significant associations for elevated risk were most consistent for ADM use.
