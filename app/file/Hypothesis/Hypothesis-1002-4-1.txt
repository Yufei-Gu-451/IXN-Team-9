Data were obtained from all 17 US cancer registries participating in the SEER programme using SEER*Stat version 7.0.5 under a data user agreement (http://seer.cancer.gov/seerstat, access date: 23 January 2012). Information on the prevalence of selected lifestyle factors for cancer and the use of CRC screening tests (colonoscopy and faecal occult blood testing) were derived from the 2009 California Health Interview Survey (CHIS) data using the askCHIS tool (http://ask.chis.ucla.edu/main/default.asp, access date: 17 February 2012). Table 2displays results from the comparisons among eight subgroups in the Asian cohort: Filipino (19.1%), Japanese (26.9%), Chinese (23.9%), Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (6.9%), Korean (7.5%), Indian/Pakistani (3.0%), Vietnamese (5.6%), and others (7.1%).
