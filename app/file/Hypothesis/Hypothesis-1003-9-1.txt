However, with unresectable disease, other types of therapy are usually needed, such as anti-hypertensive treatment with pharmacologic agents or inhibitors of catecholamine excess and radiotherapy to palliate painful bone metastases or radiometabolic treatment[None]. Anterior and posterior whole-body scans and spot images were obtained 24 and 48 h after the intravenous administration of 0.5 mCi (18 MBq) of [131I]MIBG using a whole-body scanner (E.CAM 180 dual detector gamma-camera, Siemens Medical Systems, Hoffman Estates, IL) equipped with a high-energy collimator and connected to a dedicated computer system. The average coefficient of variation for measurement of the activity of a lesion was 3.3%. [18F]Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET provides another modality for localization of metastatic pheochromocytoma, although with less tissue specificity than the other functional approaches targeting the catecholamine biosynthetic and storage pathways. Furthermore, CT and MR studies were not available in all patients for systematic comparison with the MIBG findings.
