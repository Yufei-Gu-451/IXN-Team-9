Detection of systemic levels of cardiac troponin is associated with the presence of ongoing myocardial necrosis and fulfills the contemporary definition of myocardial infarction (MI) in the presence of ischemic symptoms (1). However, a minimal increase in cardiac troponin levels below the diagnostic range often provides clinical challenges, particularly in stable ambulatory patients without overt signs and symptoms suggestive of underlying ischemia and normal renal function (2). As biochemical assays become more and more sensitive, the ability to detect minimal myocardial damage may allow risk assessment in stable cardiac patients beyond the acute setting (3). We recently have demonstrated that such presence of subclinical myocardial necrosis was associated with adverse long-term cardiovascular risks in stable patients undergoing elective coronary angiography (4).
