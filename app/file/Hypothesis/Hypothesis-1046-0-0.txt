Diabetic retinopathy is a cardinal manifestation of diabetes characterized by abnormalities in the retinal vasculature. In addition to being the leading cause of working-age adult-onset blindness in the developed world, several large prospective studies have shown that the presence and severity of diabetic retinopathy are independent determinants of future cardiovascular (CV) events in people with diabetes (1-9). In a recent systematic review of 17 studies comprising 14,896 people with type 2 diabetes (of mean age 58 years and mean follow-up 9 years), people with any retinopathy were more than twice as likely to die or suffer a fatal or nonfatal CV event than people without retinopathy, and a fourfold higher risk was noted for people with advanced retinopathy (10). The same review also included four studies comprising 4,438 people with type 1 diabetes (of mean age 33 years and mean follow-up 12 years) and reported a 3.5- to 4-fold higher risk of death as well as CV events in the presence of any retinopathy and a 7-fold higher risk with advanced retinopathy (10).
