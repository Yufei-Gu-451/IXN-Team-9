Moreover, women with pregestational diabetes are at increased risk of pregnancy-induced hypertension, pre-eclampsia, preterm delivery, and caesarean section, and pregestational diabetes can also lead to neonatal morbidity (6,7). Obesity management during pregnancy includes recommendations of appropriate weight gain. Additionally, we investigated whether it seems safe to advise this group of women to gain less than =5 kg regarding maternal health, including diabetes management, and pregnancy outcomes. Women of all ethnicities were included. The main outcome variable was birth weightzscore. Gestational weight gain was calculated as the difference between self-reported weight before pregnancy and the last weight measured before delivery. Pregnancy-related outcomesIn the multiple linear regression analysis, a gestational weight gain of less than =5 kg was significantly associated with a lower birth weightzscore when adjusted for prepregnancy BMI, smoking, HbA1cat last visit, ethnicity, preeclampsia, and nulliparity, (beta = -0.978 [95% CI -1.831 to -0.126],P= 0.025), corresponding to a one SD lower birth weight. From our study, we cannot conclude which level of weight gain should be recommended for obese women with type 2 diabetes, but our data point toward a negligible gain in the first half of pregnancy and a gain of about 150 g per week in the second. We did not find an increased rate of SGA infants among women gaining less than =5 kg, and all these women received insulin treatment. In conclusion, we found that in obese women with type 2 diabetes, maternal gestational weight gain less than =5 kg was associated with a more proportionate birth weight and less perinatal morbidity without increased risk of SGA infants.
