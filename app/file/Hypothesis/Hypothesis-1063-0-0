Autism is a complex neurodevelopmental syndrome of the central nervous system, which is characterized by severe disruptions in language and reciprocal social interactions, and a restricted repertoire of behaviors and interestsNone. The etiology of autism is largely unknown, although an important role for genetic factors has been suggested by family and twin studiesNone. New evidence, however, indicates that environmental etiologies may also contribute to risk of this disorder. In particular, a recent twin study suggests that the role of genetic factors may have been overestimated in previous studies, and the role of environmental etiologies may have been underestimatedNone, though previous studies indicate greater genetic and lesser environmental liabilityNone-None. Prenatal infection and immune dysfunction are biologically plausible potential causes of autismNone,None. There is substantial evidence that the immune response alters the development of the CNS during fetal lifeNone,None, and it has been proposed that maternal inflammation may represent a pathway by which infectious and other insults may give rise to neurodevelopmental disordersNone,None. Preclinical studies demonstrated that maternal immune activation (MIA) with synthetic double-stranded RNA (poly I:C) caused a delay in migration of cerebellar granule cells in lobule VIINone; cerebellar abnormalities, including altered volume of the vermis, and decreased numbers of Purkinje cells have been demonstrated in brains of autistic subjects, though other brain regions have been implicatedNone,None.
