Table 2displays results from the comparisons among eight subgroups in the Asian cohort: Filipino (19.1%), Japanese (26.9%), Chinese (23.9%), Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (6.9%), Korean (7.5%), Indian/Pakistani (3.0%), Vietnamese (5.6%), and others (7.1%). The CRC screening proportions in all Asian subgroups were lower than in NHW. Most Asian subgroups (Indian/Pakistani, HR 0.68,P less than 0.0001, Chinese, HR 0.94,P=0.025, and Japanese HR 0.93,P=0.006,), except Hawaiian (HR 1.2,P less than 0.0001), had better DSS than did NHW patients.
