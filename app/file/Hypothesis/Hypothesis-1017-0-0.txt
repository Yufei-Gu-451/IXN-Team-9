In general health, regular physical activity is associated with physiological benefits, including improvements in cardiovascular fitness, body composition, blood pressure, and lipid profiles. In type 2 diabetes, exercise has a beneficial effect on glycemic control associated with enhanced peripheral insulin sensitivity (1). In type 1 diabetes, physical activity levels are inversely related to the development of complications and mortality risk (2), although there is less evidence of glycemic benefit, perhaps because of reduced insulin dose or increased caloric intake to prevent hypoglycemia (3). During pregnancy, additional advantages of exercise include limitation of excess maternal weight gain, attenuation of pregnancy-induced insulin resistance (4), and lessening of delivery-related complications (5). Beneficial effects on body weight, fat mass, and cardiovascular profile may persist for several years after pregnancy (6). The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends at least 30 min of moderate intensity exercise on most days of the week in healthy pregnant women (7).
