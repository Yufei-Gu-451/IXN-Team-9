New-onset diabetes after transplant (NODAT) is a common complication of kidney transplantation. Prior studies show that approximately 15-30% of nondiabetic kidney transplant recipients develop NODAT in the first year after transplant (1-3). Many more develop impaired glucose regulation but do not quite meet diagnostic criteria for diabetes. The frequent occurrences of impaired glucose regulation and new-onset diabetes after transplantation have been well described. Furthermore, the incidence, risk factors, impact, and treatment of NODAT also have been reported (1,3-8). Missing from the literature is a detailed review of NODAT that emphasizes potential clinical strategies for its prevention.
