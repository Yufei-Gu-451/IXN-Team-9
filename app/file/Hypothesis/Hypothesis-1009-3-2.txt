The findings reported herein expand on those cited above in which we examine1) the 4-year change in fitness controlling for baseline fitness, weight loss, and various demographic characteristics,2) the 4-year change in physical activity (PA),3) the association between change in fitness, independent of change in body weight and other potential confounders, and glycemic control, and4) the association between change in PA, independent of change in body weight and other potential confounders, on glycemic control. Reasons for missing fitness data at year 4 are presented inFig. For the model with change in weight from baseline to year 4 as the outcome, we adjusted for baseline weight and fitness along with prescribed diabetes medication use. Model 2 regressed each potential mediator (changes in weight and fitness) against treatment group. Reasons for missing fitness data at year 4 are presented inFig. Based on the subsample of subjects for whom LTPA data were available, the change in LTPA from baseline to year 1 was significantly greater in ILI (871.6 kcal/week [95% CI 775.6-967.6 kcal/week];n= 1,120) compared with DSE (107.7 kcal/week [33.7-181.7];n= 1,104) (P less than 0.0001). The difference in percent fitness change between ILI and DSE observed at year 4 was significant after adjustment for baseline fitness (5.40 vs. -0.83%;P less than 0.0001), change in weight (3.62 vs. 1.03%;P= 0.001), or both baseline fitness and change in weight (3.70 vs. 0.94%;P less than 0.001). Data were also analyzed with both weight and fitness change considered as continuous variables. Data were analyzed to examine if change in glycemic control, measured by HbA1c, was influenced by fitness improvement, with fitness change categorized as described above. Post hoc analysis also showed that there was a significant difference for change in HbA1cbetween subjects grouped as having a greater than 0-10% improvement in fitness and subjects grouped as having a greater than 10% decline in fitness (P= 0.007), with this comparison not significant when analyzed separately for DSE and ILI. We also report that change in fitness was associated with improvements in glycemic control, after controlling for both change in weight and the use of diabetes medications. The results from this current investigation support the association between LTPA and weight loss after a period of 4 years.
