In fact, in the U.S., the prevalence of obesity (BMI greater than =30 kg/m2) among transplant recipients at the time of kidney transplantation doubled between 1987 and 2001 (13). 1). Statistic from ref. Thus, data from mouse models, albeit sparse, suggest that calcineurin signaling may indirectly affect the insulin sensitivity of skeletal muscle. Suggested pathogenic mechanisms of sirolimus-induced hyperglycemia include impaired insulin-mediated suppression of hepatic glucose production, deposition of ectopic triglycerides leading to insulin resistance, and direct pancreatic beta-cell toxicity. Proposed mechanisms in the pathogenesis of NODAT. Just as obesity and chronic inflammation lead to insulin resistance and subsequent development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (25), it has been suggested that inflammation and obesity before transplant are associated with NODAT. Patients with CKD and ESRD are more resistant to insulin than those with normal renal function, as assessed with a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp (30). NODAT most frequently occurs in the first year after transplantation; therefore, excess adiposity before transplant might well affect the risk of NODAT. Thus, an intervention aimed at increasing muscle mass while decreasing fat mass before transplantation may decrease the incidence of NODAT and some complications, including wound infections and development of delayed graft function (50), and may confer improved allograft and patient survival (51); however, clinical trials are needed to test this hypothesis. Patients with CKD self-report low levels of physical activity (52), and in-center hemodialysis, three times per week for 3-4 h per treatment, strongly promotes inactivity. The normoglycemic goal was 110-120 mg/dL.
