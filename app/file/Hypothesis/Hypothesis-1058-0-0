Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains the main cause of death in diabetic patients and once it has developed, diabetic patients have worse outcome as compared with nondiabetic patients. One reason for this is the difficulty of early diagnosis of CAD. Many cases of coronary atherosclerosis develop without symptoms, especially in diabetic patients. It is reported that in patients with development of ischemic heart disease, frequency of silent myocardial ischemia (SMI) is approximately three-times to six-times higher in diabetic patients than in nondiabetic patients (1). According to Detection of Ischemia in Asymptomatic Diabetes study, as much as 22% of asymptomatic type 2 diabetic patients aged 50-70 years were revealed to have SMI when they were screened for myocardial ischemia with myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (2). Therefore, early detection of asymptomatic severe CAD and rapid intervention are important to reduce mortality in the management of diabetes. Sophisticated cardiac study such as exercise electrocardiogram (ECG), myocardial perfusion scintigraphy, coronary computed tomography (CT) angiography, and coronary angiography can determine disease severity with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity. However, it is unrealistic to screen for SMI with these tools in all diabetic patients, because these tests are limited by the potential of significant adverse effects, technical difficulty, availability, and cost. Therefore, a noninvasive and inexpensive risk prediction tool of SMI is required for identifying individuals at high-risk for CAD.
