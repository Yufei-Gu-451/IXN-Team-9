Recent studies have shown that impaired mitochondrial function in the skeletal muscle may be involved in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance (5-7). In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that systemic oxidative stress is associated with lower aerobic capacity and impaired skeletal muscle energy metabolism in patients with MetS. As a result, muscle PCr loss during exercise was greater in patients with MetS (Table 2). Moreover, serum total thiols and SOD activity were significantly lower in patients with MetS than control subjects (Fig. Therefore, ROS derived from NAD(P)H oxidase may play a crucial role in increased oxidative damage in the skeletal muscle in patients with MetS. Recent large clinical trials have demonstrated that systemic oxidative stress is related to insulin resistance and obesity (15,16), which is consistent with our results that there were tight correlations between serum TBARS and insulin resistance markers such as FBS, insulin level, or free fatty acid level (Supplementary Fig.
