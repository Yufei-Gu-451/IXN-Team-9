The disease burden from diabetes is increasing in the U.S. and worldwide (1,2). With this increased burden, efficient, quality care becomes even more important. Many studies have shown that patients who see multiple providers have inferior outcomes (3-6). Continuity of care has further been associated with improved detection (7,8) and management of hypertension (8), greater adherence to diabetes preventive care and other guideline-consistent services (9-11), improved medication adherence (12), better glycemic control in patients with diabetes (13,14), lower rates of hospitalizations (15-17), and lower long-term mortality (18). Having multiple providers of primary care was also associated with increased medical services expenditures (17) through increased office visits, prescriptions, and number of specialists seen for disease-specific populations (19).
