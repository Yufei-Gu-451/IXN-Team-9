Sunitinib malate, an oral multitargeted inhibitor of VEGFRs, PDGFRs, stem cell factor receptor (KIT), and other RTKs (AbramsNone, 2003;MendelNone, 2003;O'FarrellNone, 2003a,2003b;FaivreNone, 2006), is approved for treatment of advanced RCC, imatinib-resistant gastrointestinal stromal tumour, and progressive, well-differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (DemetriNone, 2006;MotzerNone, 2006;MotzerNone, 2007;KulkeNone, 2008;RaymondNone, 2011;SUTENT (sunitinib malate) prescribing information (2012)). Patients were excluded if previously treated with gemcitabine or sunitinib; had severe/unstable angina, myocardial infarction, symptomatic congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular accident, or transient ischaemic attack within the previous 12 months; National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE, version 3.0) grade 3 haemorrhage within 4 weeks of study entry; uncontrolled hypertension; uncontrolled brain metastases; and a second malignancy diagnosis within the last 5 years. Non-haematological DLTs were any drug-related grade 3 or 4 toxicities lasting ?7 days (except for grade 3/4 hyperamylasemia or hyperlipasemia without signs of pancreatitis, grade 4 hyperuricemia or grade 3/4 hypophosphatemia without clinical symptoms, or grade 3 asymptomatic hypertension), and nausea, vomiting, or diarrhoea persisting at grade 3 or 4 despite treatment. In addition, blood samples for determination of trough levels of sunitinib and SU12662 were taken for Schedule 4/2 pre-dose on day 1 (cycles 1-3) and 24 h after the last dose (cycles 1-3 and 5), and for Schedule 2/1 were obtained before dosing on day 1 (cycles 1, 4, and 6), days 8 and 15 (cycle 1) and day 14 (cycles 4, 6, and 10). On Schedule 2/1, pre-amendment, treatment-related non-haematological grade ?3 AEs for sunitinib 37.5 mg plus gemcitabine 750 mg m-2were nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, abscess, appendicitis, electrocardiogram QT-prolongation, hyperamylasemia (eachn=1), and hyperlipasemia (n=2). This safety profile is similar to that reported in phase I trials of sunitinib in combination with other chemotherapy regimens, including docetaxel, capecitabine, pemetrexed, carboplatin plus paclitaxel, and gemcitabine (with and without cisplatin), in which most AEs were mild to moderate in studies including patients with all solid tumours or those restricted to NSCLC (SweeneyNone, 2007;ChowNone, 2008;HeathNone, 2008;TraynorNone, 2008;ReckNone, 2010;BrellNone, 2012;OkamotoNone, 2012).
