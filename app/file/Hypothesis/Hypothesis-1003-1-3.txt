The average coefficient of variation for measurement of the activity of a lesion was 3.3%. Post-chemotherapy, 30 lesions showed no MIBG uptake and 43 lesions persisted (26 showed decreased MIBG uptake, 3 had unchanged MIBG uptake, and 14 had increased MIBG uptake). 2. 4shows mean values of the sum of IR values for individual patients before and after treatment. [18F]Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET provides another modality for localization of metastatic pheochromocytoma, although with less tissue specificity than the other functional approaches targeting the catecholamine biosynthetic and storage pathways.
