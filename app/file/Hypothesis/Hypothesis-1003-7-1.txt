However, with unresectable disease, other types of therapy are usually needed, such as anti-hypertensive treatment with pharmacologic agents or inhibitors of catecholamine excess and radiotherapy to palliate painful bone metastases or radiometabolic treatment[None]. We previously demonstrated that qualitative analysis using MIBG imaging allows lesion-by-lesion evaluation of the heterogeneity of neuroblastoma response to chemotherapy[None]. In all patients, the malignant pheochromocytoma was located in non-chromaffin tissue. Relationship between the percent changes in the summed MIBG IR and the percent changes in urinary VMA with chemotherapy. CT and MR imaging are excellent for detecting mass lesions and for following their size during therapy.
