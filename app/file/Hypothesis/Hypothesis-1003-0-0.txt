Pheochromocytomas are catecholamine-secreting tumors of chromaffin tissue originating in the adrenal medulla or sympathetic paraganglia[None]. About 10% of these tumors are malignant and because the diagnosis of malignancy can only be made when they are located in non-chromaffin tissue sites, malignant pheochromocytomas are, by definition, metastatic[None,None]. Despite this, surgery is the preferred treatment for both benign and malignant pheochromocytomas. However, with unresectable disease, other types of therapy are usually needed, such as anti-hypertensive treatment with pharmacologic agents or inhibitors of catecholamine excess and radiotherapy to palliate painful bone metastases or radiometabolic treatment[None]. Previous studies have demonstrated, by measuring urinary catecholamine and metanephrine levels or RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) criteria, that combination chemotherapy can be effective for advanced malignant pheochromocytomas[None].
