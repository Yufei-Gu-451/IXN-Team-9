Pregestational diabetes is associated with various pregnancy complications. The prevalence of large-for-gestational-age (LGA) infants born to women with type 2 diabetes has been reported as ?50% (1,2). Elevated maternal glucose crosses the placental barrier, leading to fetal hyperinsulinemia, which stimulates growth both directly and indirectly (3,4). Maternal hyperglycemia and hypertriglyceridemia are characteristic features of pregnancies complicated by diabetes and are established risk factors for fetal LGA or macrosomia (4,5). Moreover, women with pregestational diabetes are at increased risk of pregnancy-induced hypertension, pre-eclampsia, preterm delivery, and caesarean section, and pregestational diabetes can also lead to neonatal morbidity (6,7).
