Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified greater than 50 genome-wide significant loci associated with type 2 diabetes to date (1). For many of these loci, association signals are localized to nonprotein-coding intronic and intergenic regions, which may contain variants that regulate gene transcription. A primary challenge remains in the transition from GWAS locus discovery to identification of functional variants underlying disease susceptibility. Tools are needed to detect functional variants from the set of disease-associated variants at a locus. FAIRE-seq (formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements) and DNase-seq are two methods that identify nucleosome-depleted (open chromatin) regions comprising active DNA regulatory elements that include promoters, enhancers, silencers, and insulators (2,3). Integration of associated variants identified through GWAS with tissue-relevant genome-wide maps of open chromatin from the ENCODE Consortium (4) and epigenomic maps from the Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium (5) has great potential to facilitate identification of regulatory variants (6-8). JAZF1(juxtaposed with another zinc finger protein) is one such locus containing variants strongly associated with type 2 diabetes (P= 5 * 10-14) that are located within intron 1 (9). JAZF1encodes a putative transcription factor. JAZF1 protein interacts with NR2C2 (nuclear receptor subfamily 2, group C, member 2) protein and represses NR2C2-mediated transactivation (10).
