Peripheral blood samples were collected after 10 h of fasting. Moreover, the degree of PCr change (i.e., PCr loss) during exercise was calculated as PCr loss = standardized PCrrest- standardized PCrpeak, in which PCrrestindicates the PCr level at rest, and PCrpeakindicates the lowest PCr level during exercise. Moreover, IMCL content positively correlated with muscle PCr loss (r= 0.55;P less than 0.01), indicating that the increased IMCL content might be attributable to impaired fatty acid oxidation in the skeletal muscle in MetS. Serum TBARS were significantly increased in patients with MetS (Fig. There were also relationships between skeletal muscle energy metabolism and some indices of systemic oxidative stress (Fig. Therefore, we established a new association between systemic oxidative stress and aerobic capacity in patients with MetS. There was a close relationship between systemic oxidative stress and impaired skeletal muscle energy metabolism (Fig. Excess circulating free fatty acids or triglycerides lead to their overflow into the mitochondria in the skeletal muscle as well as enhanced systemic oxidative stress. In summary, we demonstrated for the first time that systemic oxidative stress including higher levels of lipid peroxidation and lower antioxidant defense capacity was related to lower aerobic capacity and impaired skeletal muscle energy metabolism in patients with MetS.
