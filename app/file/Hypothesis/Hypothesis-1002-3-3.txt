The purpose of this analysis was to determine whether there are significant differences in presentation, clinicopathologic features, treatment, and survival rates between non-Hispanic white (NHW) and Asian; and between Asian subgroups in patients with CRC. In addition, lifestyle factors and screening prevalence were analysed to determine whether any disparities exist between the Asian subgroups and other ethnic groups residing in the United States and to explore the potential associations among these difference. Differences in tumour site distribution and genetics may explain the high survival rates observed among Asians.
