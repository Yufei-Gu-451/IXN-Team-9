Information on the prevalence of selected lifestyle factors for cancer and the use of CRC screening tests (colonoscopy and faecal occult blood testing) were derived from the 2009 California Health Interview Survey (CHIS) data using the askCHIS tool (http://ask.chis.ucla.edu/main/default.asp, access date: 17 February 2012). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine the influence of patient, tumour, and treatment factors (age at diagnosis, gender, year of diagnosis, median household income, ethnicity, tumour stage, tumour grade, tumour primary site, and primary surgery) of known or potential prognostic value on DSS. Table 4shows the association between disease stage, tumour grade, sex, primary site of tumour, status of surgery, year of diagnosis, age at diagnosis, and median household income with DSS in each ethnicity group.
