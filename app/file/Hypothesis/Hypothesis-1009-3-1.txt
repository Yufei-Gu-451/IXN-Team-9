At baseline, all subjects were diagnosed as having T2DM. Reasons for missing fitness data at year 4 are presented inFig. We fit separate linear regression models to examine the relationships between year 4 percent fitness change and changes in weight as well as glycemic control, both overall and stratified by treatment group. A similar pattern of weight change differences was also observed among subjects in the subsample assessed for LTPA (ILI = -4.8% [-5.3 to -4.4%]; DSE = -1.3% [-1.8 to -0.9%]). The difference in percent fitness change between ILI and DSE observed at year 4 was significant after adjustment for baseline fitness (5.40 vs. -0.83%;P less than 0.0001), change in weight (3.62 vs. 1.03%;P= 0.001), or both baseline fitness and change in weight (3.70 vs. 0.94%;P less than 0.001). Data were also analyzed with both weight and fitness change considered as continuous variables. Additional data presented here show that ILI was more effective than DSE at increasing fitness even after adjustment for baseline fitness and change in weight. Moreover, fitness was a significant mediator of the change in glycemic control in this population of individuals with T2DM. The contribution of fitness to improving glycemic control, and the finding that ILI resulted in greater improvements in fitness compared with DSE, may be of particular importance in the Look AHEAD Trial, where the primary research question is to compare CVD outcomes in response to ILI compared with DSE. These results demonstrated an association between change in fitness and improvements in glycemic control, expressed as HbA1c, even after controlling for weight loss in both ILI and DSE. This finding supports the need for primary care interventions to promote PA that results in significant improvements in fitness in patients with T2DM.
