Thus, treatment that specifically interrupts tumour vasculature through inhibition of various important receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signalling pathways, combined with a chemotherapy, may be of interest. Gemcitabine is used (alone or in combination with other chemotherapies, such as cisplatin or carboplatin) across a broad spectrum of solid tumours, including locally advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, metastatic BC, advanced NSCLC, ovarian cancer, bladder cancer, and others (Gemzar (gemcitabine HCl) prescribing information (2010);Gemzar (gemcitabine HCI) product monograph (2006)). Extensive preclinical evidence suggests additive and/or synergistic effects in solid tumour models when a variety of chemotherapies, including gemcitabine, are combined with targeted agents, including sunitinib (YeeNone, 2004;CarterNone, 2007;ChristensenNone, 2008), as demonstrated in a recently reported phase I trial of sunitinib on a continuous daily dosing schedule plus gemcitabine in patients with advanced solid tumours (BrellNone, 2012). Sarcomatoid differentiation, found across all RCC histological subtypes (de Peralta-VenturinaNone, 2001), is thought to represent transformation of RCC to a higher grade (ChevilleNone, 2004;GolshayanNone, 2009), and is associated with a relatively poor prognosis and median overall survival of only ?3-10 months with non-targeted agents (e.g., immunotherapy;de Peralta-VenturinaNone, 2001;EscudierNone, 2002;MianNone, 2002;KwakNone, 2007). Our results also suggest that sunitinib combined with gemcitabine may be a more active regimen than gemcitabine-based chemotherapy, which has also shown limited activity in sarcomatoid RCC (StadlerNone, 2003;NanusNone, 2004). Although targeted therapies have yet to deliver significant advances in pancreatic cancer treatment (O'Reilly 2009), there are indications that combining EGFR-directed and/or antiangiogenic agents with gemcitabine may be beneficial (MooreNone, 2007;Van CutsemNone, 2009).
