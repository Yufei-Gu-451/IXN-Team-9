Sunitinib malate, an oral multitargeted inhibitor of VEGFRs, PDGFRs, stem cell factor receptor (KIT), and other RTKs (AbramsNone, 2003;MendelNone, 2003;O'FarrellNone, 2003a,2003b;FaivreNone, 2006), is approved for treatment of advanced RCC, imatinib-resistant gastrointestinal stromal tumour, and progressive, well-differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (DemetriNone, 2006;MotzerNone, 2006;MotzerNone, 2007;KulkeNone, 2008;RaymondNone, 2011;SUTENT (sunitinib malate) prescribing information (2012)). Extensive preclinical evidence suggests additive and/or synergistic effects in solid tumour models when a variety of chemotherapies, including gemcitabine, are combined with targeted agents, including sunitinib (YeeNone, 2004;CarterNone, 2007;ChristensenNone, 2008), as demonstrated in a recently reported phase I trial of sunitinib on a continuous daily dosing schedule plus gemcitabine in patients with advanced solid tumours (BrellNone, 2012). The phase I dose-finding study reported here was also conducted to investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and antitumor activity of sunitinib (on an intermittent dosing schedule) in combination with gemcitabine in patients with advanced solid tumours for whom curative therapy was not available. In addition, up to six additional patients could be included at specific dose levels on either schedule to further define the observed toxicity profile. Schedule 4/2 was not evaluated past the initial combination dose level (sunitinib 37.5 mg and gemcitabine 750 mg m-2) as it proved to be an awkward scheduling regimen in practice because of missed or delayed doses of gemcitabine (see Determination of MTD). If ANC was between 500 and 1000 cells per mm3with no signs and symptoms of infection, gemcitabine was given as scheduled and growth factor administration (Neulasta; pegfilgrastim) occurred 1 day later. Blood samples for determination of full PK profiles for sunitinib and SU12662 were collected for patients receiving Schedule 4/2 on cycle 1, day 15 (sunitinib alone) and day 22 (sunitinib and gemcitabine), and for patients receiving Schedule 2/1 on cycle 1, day 8 (sunitinib and gemcitabine) and day 15 (sunitinib alone) at pre-dose and up to 25 h post-dose. Of the 36 patients on Schedule 2/1, 11 were enrolled before the protocol amendment that allowed the use of growth factor support and 25 were enrolled post-amendment. Median days on sunitinib treatment were 92, 84, and 83-254 (depending on the dose level), respectively, and the median relative dose intensity for sunitinib was 58.4, 72.9, and 77.4-100% (67.8, 75.0, and 87.6-100% for gemcitabine). Haematological AEs were neutropenia (grade 3 (n=1) and grade 4 (n=2)) and leucopenia (grade 3 (n=2)). Treatment-related AEs (grade ?3) occurring among the 25 patients on Schedule 2/1, post-amendment, are detailed inTable 3. Non-haematological treatment-related AEs included: grade 4 uric acid elevation (n=2), hypertension, pulmonary embolism, and cerebrovascular accident (n=1 each), grade 3 elevation of amylase (n=2) or lipase (n=1), hypertension, pericardial effusion, leukoencephalopathy, nausea, mucosal inflammation, hypophosphatemia, and hypomagnesemia (eachn=1). Overall, of the total population (n=44), 8 patients (18%) had an objective response, including 7 of 25 patients (28%) on Schedule 2/1, post-amendment (Table 5). In our study, all of the RCC patients who were poor risk and/or had high grade or sarcomatoid disease achieved a PR or SD with sunitinib plus gemcitabine. In that study, 6/21 patients (29%) treated with sunitinib achieved a PR and a further nine patients treated with sunitinib (43%) had s.d. A phase II trial investigating sunitinib plus gemcitabine in sarcomatoid and/or poor-risk patients with RCC (NCT00556049) is underway, and a randomized phase II study of sunitinib with/without gemcitabine in advanced RCC with sarcomatoid features (ECOG-E1808; NCT01164228) has been initiated. Phase II studies of this combination in patients with RCC or pancreatic cancer are underway.
