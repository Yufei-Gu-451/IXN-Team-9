An important component of the Look AHEAD Trial was the use of objective measures of fitness on all individuals randomized to participate in this study. We previously reported that fitness was significantly increased in ILI compared with DSE after 1 year of intervention (4), and that fitness remained significantly higher in ILI compared with DSE after 4 years of participation in this study (3). The findings reported herein expand on those cited above in which we examine1) the 4-year change in fitness controlling for baseline fitness, weight loss, and various demographic characteristics,2) the 4-year change in physical activity (PA),3) the association between change in fitness, independent of change in body weight and other potential confounders, and glycemic control, and4) the association between change in PA, independent of change in body weight and other potential confounders, on glycemic control. The test was terminated when the participant reached 80% of age-predicted maximal heart rate (for those not taking a beta-blocker) or attained a rating of 16 on the 15-category rating of perceived exertion (RPE) scale (8) (for those taking a beta-blocker). Bivariate associations between percent change in fitness at year 4 and baseline characteristics, including age, sex, race/ethnicity, insulin use, diabetes medication use, HbA1c, smoking status, metabolic syndrome, BMI, and waist circumference, were evaluated using either two-sample Studentttest, ANOVA, or Spearman rank correlation test based on the distributions of baseline variables. When compared with participants who did not provide fitness data at 4 years, at baseline, those who did provide fitness data were significantly younger, had a lower weight, BMI, and waist circumference, had lower HbA1c, reported a shorter duration of diabetes, and had a higher level of fitness. A similar pattern of weight change differences was also observed among subjects in the subsample assessed for LTPA (ILI = -4.8% [-5.3 to -4.4%]; DSE = -1.3% [-1.8 to -0.9%]). Based on the subsample of subjects for whom LTPA data were available, the change in LTPA from baseline to year 1 was significantly greater in ILI (871.6 kcal/week [95% CI 775.6-967.6 kcal/week];n= 1,120) compared with DSE (107.7 kcal/week [33.7-181.7];n= 1,104) (P less than 0.0001). However, there was a decrease in LTPA from year 1 to 4 in ILI to 348.3 (1,562.2) kcal/week (n= 1,078), whereas DSE remained relatively unchanged at 104.5 (1,308.7) kcal/week (n= 1,068). The difference in percent fitness change between ILI and DSE observed at year 4 was significant after adjustment for baseline fitness (5.40 vs. -0.83%;P less than 0.0001), change in weight (3.62 vs. 1.03%;P= 0.001), or both baseline fitness and change in weight (3.70 vs. 0.94%;P less than 0.001). These multivariate analyses showed that percent change in fitness was greater in ILI versus DSE by 6.6% (95% CI 5.2-8.0%), 5.80% (3.2-8.4%), and 1.9% (0.5-3.3%) at years 1, 2, and 4, respectively (P less than 0.0001). Subjects were categorized by the magnitude of fitness change from baseline to year 4 ( greater than 10% decline [DSE,n= 735; ILI,n= 556], 0-10% decline [DSE,n= 514; ILI,n= 547], greater than 0-10% improvement [DSE,n= 164; ILI,n= 200], and greater than 10% improvement [DSE,n= 500; ILI,n= 702]) to examine if change in weight was associated with change in fitness from baseline to 4 years. Results of these analyses showed that a greater increase in fitness was associated with a greater weight loss with DSE and ILI combined (beta = -0.10035, SE = 0.00492,P less than 0.0001) and when examined separately for DSE (beta = -0.09563, SE = 0.00785,P less than 0.0001) and ILI (beta = -0.10389, SE = 0.00624,P less than 0.0001). When adjusted for clinical site, treatment, baseline HbA1c, diabetes medication use, baseline fitness, and weight change, the inverse relationship between change in HbA1cand fitness was significant both overall (P less than 0.0001) and for both DSE (P less than 0.0001) and ILI (P less than 0.001) (Fig. Post hoc analysis showed that there was a significant difference for change in HbA1cbetween subjects grouped as having a greater than 10% increase in fitness and both subject groups as having a greater than 10% decline in fitness (P less than 0.0001) and a 0-10% decline in fitness (P less than 0.0001) at 4 years, with these comparisons remaining significant when data were analyzed separately for DSE and ILI. When change in fitness was treated as a continuous variable and with adjustment for selected covariates, there was a significant inverse association between HbA1cand change in fitness at 4 years (beta = -0.00431, SE = 0.00048,P less than 0.0001), and this was consistent when analyzed separately for DSE (beta = -0.0286, SE = 0.00130,P= 0.03) and ILI (beta = -0.00295, SE = 0.00106,P less than 0.0001). Results showed that both change in weight (indirect effect = -0.0779 [95% CI -0.1026 to -0.0554]) and change in fitness (-0.0264 [-0.0401 to -0.0156]) were significant mediators of the change in HbA1c. Additional data presented here show that ILI was more effective than DSE at increasing fitness even after adjustment for baseline fitness and change in weight. An interesting finding is that this association was present for both ILI and DSE interventions, with the reduction in HbA1cobserved with an increase in fitness of greater than 10% being significantly greater than the change in HbA1cobserved with a decline in fitness (seeFig. Moreover, fitness was a significant mediator of the change in glycemic control in this population of individuals with T2DM. For example, the results of our mediation analysis showed that both weight loss and fitness change mediated the effect on change in HbA1c. However, it is important to recognize that the effect of weight loss on change in HbA1cwas significantly greater than the effect of change in fitness, but this does not minimize the important contribution of fitness in improving glycemic control. The results from this current investigation support the association between LTPA and weight loss after a period of 4 years. For example, the Italian Diabetes and Exercise Study showed a significant reduction in HbA1c(-0.30 [95% CI -0.49 to -0.10) in response to 12 months of exercise, compared with control (20), with the exercise intervention including twice-a-week supervised sessions. Despite minimal change in body weight in response to the DSE intervention, improved fitness was significantly related to improved glycemic control. This finding supports the need for primary care interventions to promote PA that results in significant improvements in fitness in patients with T2DM.
