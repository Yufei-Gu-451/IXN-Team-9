The search for a sustainable substitute for fossil fuels has stimulated research into bioenergy crops. The criteria for such crops include low-input requirements, rapid accumulation of biomass and high yield. Perenniality is also advantageous, both economically and environmentally, as financial costs are saved on annual re-planting and tilling and environmentally by the sequestration of carbon in the soil (Clifton-BrownNone, 2007). As a C4perennial rhizomatous grass with a high annual yield and low-input requirements (LewandowskiNone, 2000),Miscanthusfulfils these criteria. As a C4plantMiscanthusexhibits high radiation, water- and nitrogen-use efficiencies (LewandowskiNone, 2000). The penalty of C4photosynthesis, however, is a higher thermal requirement to initiate growth in the spring which imposes a limitation on growing range (Long, 1983;NaiduNone, 2003). Currently all commercial plantations ofMiscanthus, and indeed a large amount of the research, have focussed on a single genotypeM.*giganteus. This genotype is a sterile triploid progeny of a cross betweenM. sinensisandM. sacchariflorus; it is high yielding, reportedly producing over 20 t dry matter ha-1year-1in Europe (LewandowskiNone, 2000) and over 30 t dry matter ha-1year-1in the mid-western USA (Dohleman and Long, 2009). An unusual characteristic ofM. *giganteusis its ability to maintain high rates of light-saturated photosynthesis under chilling conditions inhibitory to other C4crops such asZea mays(maize;NaiduNone, 2003). However, it has shown poor overwinter survival rates in northern locations (Clifton-Brown and Lewandowski, 2000) and, owing to its sterility,M. *giganteuscan only be vegetatively propagated from rhizome pieces, resulting in high establishment costs. A major plant breeding target is to develop a seed-based crop that can equal or outperformM.*giganteus. The geographical range forMiscanthusspans from the sub-tropics to the sub-arctic (Numata, 1974;Clifton-Brown and Lewandowski, 2000). Correspondingly, variation in cold tolerance has been observed in different genotypes (Clifton-Brown and Jones, 1997;Clifton-Brown and Lewandowski, 2000;FarrellNone, 2006;YanNone, 2012).
