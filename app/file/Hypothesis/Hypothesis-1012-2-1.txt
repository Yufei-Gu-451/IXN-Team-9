We previously reported that Japanese patients have a markedly low prevalence of obesity and low incidence rates of overt nephropathy and diabetic retinopathy (10-13). Data from the 1,748 patients with type 2 diabetes in the Japan Diabetes Complications Study (JDCS) (26) and the Japanese Elderly Diabetes Intervention Trial (J-EDIT) (27) provide an opportunity to develop a comprehensive risk engine for Asian patients with type 2 diabetes. The J-EDIT is a randomized, controlled trial of intensive and conventional treatments for diabetes that registered a total of 1,173 Japanese type 2 diabetes patients 65-85 years of age whose HbA1clevels were greater than =8.1%, or greater than =7.5% with at least one of the following criteria: BMI greater than =25 kg/m2; blood pressure greater than =130/85 mmHg; serum total cholesterol greater than =200 mg/dL (5.17 mmol/L) or LDL cholesterol greater than =120 mg/dL (3.10 mmol/L) in participants without CHD; serum total cholesterol greater than =180 mg/dL (4.65 mmol/L) or LDL cholesterol greater than =100 mg/dL (2.59 mmol/L) in participants with CHD; triglycerides greater than =150 mg/dL (1.68 mmol/L); and HDL cholesterol less than 40 mg/dL (1.03 mmol/L). Data management was conducted by a central data center. A retinopathy event was progression to stage 3 or 4. Further, we constructed a reclassification table of macro- and microvascular complications (34). In contrast, the UKPDS risk engine overestimated CHD risk, and this tendency is consistent with a previous report in Asian patients (18). Although the prevalence of micro- or macroalbuminuria in Asian hypertensive diabetes is alarmingly high (36), most of the progression to overt nephropathy occurs in a small fraction of patients with elevated HbA1cand SBP values and a smoking habit (12). With regard to lifestyle factors, we identified LTPA as a risk factor for stroke and noncardiovascular mortality, although the statistical significance was borderline. One important feature of this study is that we analyzed pooled data from two nationwide clinical trials in Japan. Finally, we defined overt nephropathy as the presence of persistent proteinuria, since an elevated urinary albumin excretion due to nondiabetic renal lesions or conditions is not rare.
