Maternal hyperglycemia and hypertriglyceridemia are characteristic features of pregnancies complicated by diabetes and are established risk factors for fetal LGA or macrosomia (4,5). Obesity is a common characteristic of pregnant women with type 2 diabetes. Additionally, we investigated whether it seems safe to advise this group of women to gain less than =5 kg regarding maternal health, including diabetes management, and pregnancy outcomes. If a woman presented with ketonuria, her plasma glucose and carbohydrate intake were evaluated. Nearly all women were insulin treated from early pregnancy, but significantly less insulin was needed in the group of women gaining less than =5 kg (Table 2). Pregnancy-related outcomesIn the multiple linear regression analysis, a gestational weight gain of less than =5 kg was significantly associated with a lower birth weightzscore when adjusted for prepregnancy BMI, smoking, HbA1cat last visit, ethnicity, preeclampsia, and nulliparity, (beta = -0.978 [95% CI -1.831 to -0.126],P= 0.025), corresponding to a one SD lower birth weight. The cases of malformation and perinatal mortality were reviewed. From our study, we cannot conclude which level of weight gain should be recommended for obese women with type 2 diabetes, but our data point toward a negligible gain in the first half of pregnancy and a gain of about 150 g per week in the second. 21).
