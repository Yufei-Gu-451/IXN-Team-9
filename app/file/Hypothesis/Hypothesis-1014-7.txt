These data are linked to Alberta Health administrative data, which captures resource utilization for all provincial residents with public health insurance. Since public health insurance does not provide universal drug coverage for residents less than 65 years of age, drug costs are only available for patients greater than 65 years of age. For those patients not on dialysis at baseline, the eGFR was estimated from serum creatinine using the validated CKD-EPI equation (26). As a secondary outcome, we studied 5-year cumulative costs for the subset of patients greater than 65 years of age, including drug costs. In patients greater than 65 years of age, two-thirds had filled a prescription for one or more oral antidiabetic medication at baseline (62.2%), and approximately one-fifth (17.4%) of patients were on insulin. Compared with patients less than 65 years of age, patients greater than 65 years of age were less likely to be Aboriginal (6.5 vs. 2.2%), less likely to be on income support (16.7 vs. 4.8%), had a longer average duration of diabetes (5.0 vs. 5.9 years), and had a higher burden of disease measured by a Charlson score of greater than 3 (6.6 vs. 21.1%) (Table 1). Among patients less than 65 years of age, those with unmeasured HbA1cwere less likely to have comorbid illness, possibly suggesting that some of the unmeasured patients were misclassified. Mean total 5-year unadjusted costs per patient with diabetes, overall and by subgroupThe cost of managing patients with diabetes, stratified by category of glycemic controlAfter stratification by kidney function, the adjusted cost of caring for patients with diabetes varied from $25,316 (for patients with eGFR 90 mL/min) to $115,348 (for patients not on dialysis with eGFR 15 mL/min) (Fig. 1). The model estimates that patients with an eGFR of 15 mL/min have average 5-year costs $91,419 higher compared with a patient with no renal impairment (eGFR 90 mL/min), patients with heavy proteinuria have costs $22,305 higher per patient compared with those with no proteinuria, and patients with inadequate glycemic control had costs $5,565 higher per patient compared with those with good glycemic control. This represents ?12.5% of total health care spending in Canada, which was estimated at $200 billion annually in 2011 (29). (14) found that in HMO patients, higher HbA1cwas predictive of costs in patients with HbA1c greater than 7.5% but not in patients with HbA1cof less than 7.5%. We did not adjust for medication use since this information was not available for the entire cohort, nor were we able to adjust for unknown factors, such as mild diabetes, misclassification, and more specific socioeconomic characteristics.
