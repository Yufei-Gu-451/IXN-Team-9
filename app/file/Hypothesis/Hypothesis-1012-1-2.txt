Asian patients with diabetes have several important features. We previously reported that Japanese patients have a markedly low prevalence of obesity and low incidence rates of overt nephropathy and diabetic retinopathy (10-13). Furthermore, the risk factor profiles of diabetes complications are quite different between Japanese and Western subjects with diabetes (14). In cohort studies of multiple ethnic groups, lower incidence rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) were observed in Asian patients than in whites (15,16). Data management was conducted by a central data center. Further, we constructed a reclassification table of macro- and microvascular complications (34). By the UKPDS risk engine, more than half of patients had a macrovascular risk of 10% or more (249 of the 376 cases and 697 of the 1,372 noncases), as expected by the tendency of overestimation The sensitivity and specificity of the UKPDS risk engine with a cutoff value of 10% risk were 66.2 and 49.2%, respectively. A novelty of the JJ risk engine is that it allows risk classification based on the risk not only of CVD but also of renal and eye diseases. For the prediction of stroke, we did not identify smoking status and years after diagnosis as predictors, which are included in the UKPDS risk engine (6). Finally, we defined overt nephropathy as the presence of persistent proteinuria, since an elevated urinary albumin excretion due to nondiabetic renal lesions or conditions is not rare.
