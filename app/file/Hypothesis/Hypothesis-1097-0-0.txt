There is little consensus on the importance of glucose variability (1). In order to recognize glucose variability as an independent risk factor or a causal factor in the development of microvascular and macrovascular complications or mortality, glucose variability should be deleterious above the harmful effects of both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia. In other words, the question is whether larger or more frequent glucose excursions within the euglycemic range are more harmful than small, less frequent glucose excursions, which are also seen in healthy individuals and are therefore likely to be of no consequence (or could theoretically even be beneficial) (Fig.
