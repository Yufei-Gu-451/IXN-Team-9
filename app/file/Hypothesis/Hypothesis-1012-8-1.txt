Given the overestimation of risks of coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke in Chinese patients by the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) risk engine (17,18), risk engines for non-Asian populations may not be transportable to Asian patients. This was done by fitting a multistate Cox regression model (28), an extension of the Cox model to multiple time-to-event end points, to the pooled data from these trials. Design of the JDCS and the J-EDIT has been described in detail elsewhere (26,27). The J-EDIT is a randomized, controlled trial of intensive and conventional treatments for diabetes that registered a total of 1,173 Japanese type 2 diabetes patients 65-85 years of age whose HbA1clevels were greater than =8.1%, or greater than =7.5% with at least one of the following criteria: BMI greater than =25 kg/m2; blood pressure greater than =130/85 mmHg; serum total cholesterol greater than =200 mg/dL (5.17 mmol/L) or LDL cholesterol greater than =120 mg/dL (3.10 mmol/L) in participants without CHD; serum total cholesterol greater than =180 mg/dL (4.65 mmol/L) or LDL cholesterol greater than =100 mg/dL (2.59 mmol/L) in participants with CHD; triglycerides greater than =150 mg/dL (1.68 mmol/L); and HDL cholesterol less than 40 mg/dL (1.03 mmol/L). Data management was conducted by a central data center. We compared hazards for end points between tertiles of the calculated 5-year risks from the 10-fold cross-validation by the Cox regression. Discrimination, the ability to distinguish between those who experienced the event and those who did not, was evaluated using Harrell C statistics, the proportion of all patient pairs in which the predictions of the model and observed events were concordant. Further, we constructed a reclassification table of macro- and microvascular complications (34). If we combined macro- and microvascular risks, 73 of 376 cases (19.4%) and 187 of 1,372 noncases (13.6%) were newly classified as a high-risk population, and sensitivity increased up to 46.3% while specificity was maintained at 75.4%. Risk classification of the 1,748 patients according to 5-year risks of macro- and microvascular diseases based on the JJ risk engineTo illustrate the use of the JJ risk engine, consider two Japanese men 60 years of age with simple diabetic retinopathy and without atrial fibrillation who do not have smoking and exercise habits. The SBP of one patient is 120 mmHg. His leading risks are macrovascular diseases (16.1% for CHD and 17.6% for stroke), and his microvascular risks are moderate (7.8% for nephropathy and 13.6% for retinopathy). Donnan et al. The risk equation from the Swedish National Diabetes Register incorporates the use of antihypertensive drugs and lipid-lowering drugs as predictors (9). Statistical modeling can be much more complex if we handle multiple events simultaneously.
