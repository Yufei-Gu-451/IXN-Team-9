Type 2 diabetes is preceded by a differential activation of components of the innate immune system (1,2). Serum amyloid A (SAA) is a sensitive marker of the acute inflammatory state. Its acute-phase isoform (A-SAA) is up-regulated up to 1,000-fold in response to inflammatory stimuli such as trauma, infection, injury, and stress (3-5). The high inductive capacity, along with the fact that genes and proteins are highly conserved throughout the evolution of vertebrates and invertebrates, suggests that A-SAA plays a key role in pathogen defense mechanisms and probably functions as an effector molecule of the immune system (3). Cross-sectional data have demonstrated an association between elevated systemic A-SAA concentrations and prevalent type 2 diabetes (6,7) as well as the related metabolic parameters homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance, fasting insulin, and HbA1c(8,9).
