Recent analyses of randomized clinical trials of statins have shown a higher incidence of diabetes in the treatment arm (1,2). A meta-analysis of 13 placebo-controlled randomized trials showed 9% (95% CI 2-17%) higher odds of diabetes in the statin arm. Another meta-analysis of five secondary prevention trials that compared more- versus less-intensive statin treatment reported 12% (4-22%) higher odds of diabetes in the more-intensive treatment arms (2). One observational study also reported a positive association between statin use and the subsequent risk of diabetes (3), although another study reported different associations (null, positive, or negative) depending on the particular statins used (4).
