The prevalence of type 2 diabetes has been increasing rapidly throughout the world during the past decades (1). Since cardiovascular disease is the major complication of type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular mortality accounts for the majority of diabetic patient deaths, there has been growing interest in developing strategies for blood glucose control in type 2 diabetic patients to reduce cardiovascular risk and mortality (2-6). Among various oral glucose-lowering medications, metformin and sulfonylureas have been the mainstay treatments for type 2 diabetes. Several studies have examined the effects of these medications on cardiovascular risk among diabetic patients; the results, however, are inconsistent (2,7-9). In an early, large-scale, randomized trial, an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality was observed in diabetic patients treated with sulfonylurea (tolbutamide) or biguanide (phenformin) medications (7,8). Some other studies suggest that these two classes of medications might differentially affect cardiovascular risk (9-14).
