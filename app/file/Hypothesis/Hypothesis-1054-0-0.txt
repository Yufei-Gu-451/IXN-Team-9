Bone fractures represent a significant burden of morbidity, especially among women and persons older than 65 years of age (1). Fractures that result in inpatient hospitalization are particularly associated with significant health care costs, reductions in quality of life, and increased mortality (2,3). Evidence suggests that persons with type 2 diabetes may be at increased risk for bone fractures, despite having higher bone mineral density (4). However, the association of diabetes with fracture risk has differed depending on the location of fracture being investigated (5,6). Furthermore, few large, community-based studies of fracture risk have included both genders and nonwhite participants.
