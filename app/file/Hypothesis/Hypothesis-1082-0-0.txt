Accumulation and aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins (tau pathology) into neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) is a major pathological process encountered in Alzheimer disease (AD) (1). NFT are observed early in life and increase during ageing in hippocampal area (2). In AD, the spatiotemporal progression of NFT from the hippocampus to isocortical areas correlates to cognitive deficits (3), supporting an instrumental role of tau pathology in memory deficits. Individual components of the metabolic syndrome have been linked to the risk of developing cognitive impairments and AD (for reviews, see Refs. 4and5). Particularly, midlife development of obesity, a risk factor for insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, was described to increase the risk of dementia and AD later in life (6,7). Also, morbidly obese elderly individuals exhibit enhanced hippocampal tau phosphorylation (8). The detrimental effect of obesity on tau phosphorylation observed in the brain of AD patients might arise from central insulin resistance, which develops secondary to peripheral resistance (9-11). In line, central disruption of insulin signaling by insulin receptor or insulin receptor substrate (IRS) 2 gene deletion or following intracerebral streptozotocine injections leads to tau hyperphosphorylation (12-15). However, none of these studies have been performed in models developing an AD-like tau pathology.
