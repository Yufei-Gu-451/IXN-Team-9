Accordingly, our aim was to determine ifl-arginine, which is the substrate for NO synthase, would reverse sex-dependent renal hemodynamic and blood pressure differences in the response to clamped hyperglycemia in patients with uncomplicated type 1 DM. Plasma cGMP also was measured as a marker of NO production (5). Thereafter, inulin and PAH were infused continuously at a rate calculated to maintain their respective plasma concentrations constant at 20 and 1.5 mg/dL. The cGMP assay is based on the competition between cGMP in the standards or samples and a cGMP-acetylcholinesterase conjugate (cGMP tracer) for a limited number of cGMP-specific rabbit antibody binding sites. Plasma insulin levels were measured using standard techniques (18). As expected from our previous work, induction of clamped hyperglycemia also was associated with significant increases in SBP, GFR, and FF in women but not in men (Tables 1and2). As expected, SBP did not change in either group in response tol-arginine during clamped hyperglycemia. The goal of the current study was to determine if NO synthase activation withl-arginine would reverse sex-dependent renal hemodynamic and blood pressure differences in the response to clamped hyperglycemia in type 1 DM patients. Our data therefore suggest that women exhibit enhanced NO bioactivity in the postglomerular circulation at baseline during clamped euglycemia; clamped hyperglycemia alone quenches postglomerular NO, leading to an increase in GFR and FF with lesser effects on ERPF, and these effects are reversible with infusion ofl-arginine. In conclusion, our results suggest that NO bioactivity may contribute to the exaggerated renal effects of hyperglycemia in women with type 1 DM.
