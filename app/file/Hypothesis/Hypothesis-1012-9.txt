Risk classification for vascular complications is of particular importance in diabetes care, and there is a need for validated diabetes-specific risk engines (1,2). Furthermore, the risk factor profiles of diabetes complications are quite different between Japanese and Western subjects with diabetes (14). The aim of the current study was therefore to develop and validate an algorithm that separately calculates each risk of the first occurrence for five events: fatal and nonfatal CHD, fatal and nonfatal stroke, noncardiovascular mortality, overt nephropathy, and progression of retinopathy. In the JDCS, 2,033 Japanese type 2 diabetes patients 40-70 years of age whose HbA1clevels were greater than =7.0% were randomized to a conventional treatment group and a lifestyle intervention group; throughout the paper, we present the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program value of HbA1ccalculated as follows: 0.25 + 1.02 * JDC value (29). The J-EDIT is a randomized, controlled trial of intensive and conventional treatments for diabetes that registered a total of 1,173 Japanese type 2 diabetes patients 65-85 years of age whose HbA1clevels were greater than =8.1%, or greater than =7.5% with at least one of the following criteria: BMI greater than =25 kg/m2; blood pressure greater than =130/85 mmHg; serum total cholesterol greater than =200 mg/dL (5.17 mmol/L) or LDL cholesterol greater than =120 mg/dL (3.10 mmol/L) in participants without CHD; serum total cholesterol greater than =180 mg/dL (4.65 mmol/L) or LDL cholesterol greater than =100 mg/dL (2.59 mmol/L) in participants with CHD; triglycerides greater than =150 mg/dL (1.68 mmol/L); and HDL cholesterol less than 40 mg/dL (1.03 mmol/L). The present analysis excluded patients who had any history of angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, stroke, peripheral artery disease, familial hypercholesterolemia (diagnosed clinically by markedly elevated LDL cholesterol levels with enlarged Achilles tendons and/or family history of premature coronary artery disease), type III hyperlipidemia (diagnosed by broad beta-band on electrophoresis), nephrotic syndrome, serum creatinine levels greater than 1.3 mg/dL (120 mumol/L), mean values of two spot urine examinations for an albumin excretion rate of 150 mg/g creatinine (17.0 mg/mmol) or more, microscopic hematuria, or other clinical findings indicating other renal diseases, preproliferative and proliferative retinopathy, and major ocular disease (e.g., glaucoma, dense cataract, or history of cataract surgery). In brief, diabetic retinopathy was determined annually by qualified ophthalmologists at each institute using the international diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema disease scales (33) with minor modification: stage 0, no retinopathy; stage 1, hemorrhage and hard exudates; stage 2, soft exudates; stage 3, intraretinal microvascular abnormalities and venous changes, including beading, loop, and duplication; and stage 4, new vessels, vitreous hemorrhage, fibrous proliferation, and retinal detachment. The following risk factors were screened through a backward variable selection with the critical value ofP= 0.1: age, sex, HbA1c, years after diagnosis, BMI, systolic blood pressure (SBP), NHDL-C, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, log-transformed triglycerides, log-transformed urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR), estimated glomerular filtration rate, atrial fibrillation, smoking status, alcohol intake, and LTPA. One round of cross-validation involved randomly partitioning a sample of data on 1,748 patients into complementary subsets, fitting the stratified Cox regression model to one subset of 90% of patients, and validating the model on the remaining subset with the criteria described below. The mean +/- SD (range) age and HbA1clevel at baseline of the 1,748 Japanese type 2 diabetic patients was 62.1 +/- 8.6 (40-84) years and 7.9 +/- 1.2 (6.0-15.8)%, respectively, and 49.9% of the subjects were women. Their mean baseline values indicated that the subjects had good control of weight (BMI = 23.2 +/- 3.1 kg/m2; waist circumference = 80.3 +/- 9.6 cm), blood pressure (SBP = 132.9 +/- 16.0 mmHg), and serum cholesterol levels (NHDL-C = 3.78 +/- 0.90 mmol/L; LDL cholesterol = 3.16 +/- 0.82 mmol/L; HDL cholesterol = 1.43 +/- 0.44 mmol/L; triglycerides = 1.39 +/- 0.88 mmol/L). During the median follow-up of 7.2 years, among the 1,748 subjects, we observed 96 (5.5%) events of fatal or nonfatal CHD, 89 (5.1%) fatal or nonfatal strokes, 71 (4.1%) overt nephropathies defined by persistent proteinuria, and 64 (3.7%) noncardiovascular deaths. Significant modifiable risk factors were HbA1cand NHDL-C for CHD, HbA1c, SBP, and NHDL-C for stroke, BMI less than 18.5 kg/m2and being a current smoker for noncardiovascular mortality, HbA1cand being a current smoker for overt nephropathy, and HbA1cfor retinopathy. The HRs (95% CI) of the second and third tertiles compared with the first tertile were 2.09 (1.07-4.09) and 5.22 (2.84-9.58) for CHD; 1.78 (0.96-3.30) and 3.32 (1.86-5.92) for stroke; 2.14 (1.09-4.18) and 3.17 (1.65-6.09) for noncardiovascular mortality; 1.54 (0.55-4.34) and 10.59 (4.56-24.59) for overt nephropathy; and 1.18 (0.58-2.40) and 2.56 (1.37-4.81) for progression of retinopathy. In contrast, the UKPDS risk engine (5,6) overestimated CHD risk in Japanese patients (O/P ratios [Hosmer-LemeshowP]: 0.30 [P less than 0.01] for CHD and 0.72 [P= 0.54] for stroke) (Table 2). Risk classification of the 1,748 patients according to 5-year risks of macrovascular disease based on the JJ risk engine and the UKPDS risk engineTable 4shows how the combination of 5-year risks of macro- and microvascular complications based on the JJ risk engine classified low-risk and high-risk patients. In contrast, the UKPDS risk engine overestimated CHD risk, and this tendency is consistent with a previous report in Asian patients (18). A novelty of the JJ risk engine is that it allows risk classification based on the risk not only of CVD but also of renal and eye diseases. Combining macro- and microvascular risks resulted in the net reclassification improvement of 5.7% (P= 0.02) and a sensitivity and specificity of 46.3 and 75.4%, respectively; only 16.5% of cases were classified as the high-risk population for macro- and microvascular diseases and only 43.8% of noncases were in the low-risk population (Table 4). (7) added diabetes duration, treated hypertension, height, and two interaction terms into their model, and the risk equation of the HKDR includes diabetes duration, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and ACR additionally but does not use HbA1c(18). For the prediction of stroke, we did not identify smoking status and years after diagnosis as predictors, which are included in the UKPDS risk engine (6). With regard to lifestyle factors, we identified LTPA as a risk factor for stroke and noncardiovascular mortality, although the statistical significance was borderline.
