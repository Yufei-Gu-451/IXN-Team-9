stroke is the leading causeof disability in adults and the fourth most common cause of death in the United States (33). Ischemic stroke, resulting from the obstruction of blood flow to the brain, accounts for greater than 80% of all stroke cases (4). Most of the ischemic strokes are caused by atherosclerosis in the carotid arteries. Carotid plaques directly or indirectly, through formation of thrombi, result in stenosis of the vessels and block the blood flow to the brain (24). Due to the ready accessibility and the close association with the brain, the carotid arteries are the most extensively studied vessels in vivo with ultrasonography. Patients with noticeable carotid stenosis have severely impaired cerebral blood flow and markedly increased risk for ipsilateral stroke (24,26). For those with no obvious carotid stenosis, perspective studies also show a close association between the intima-media thickening and the risk of stroke (21,25,48). Intima-media thickening of the carotid arteries is an established parameter of subclinical atherosclerosis (9,40). Genetic studies of twin pairs and families have demonstrated the heritability of carotid atherosclerosis or common and internal carotid artery intima media thickness (34,44,60). However, identification of susceptibility genes involved has not been achieved. To date, robust and replicable associations in nonisolated populations are only limited to variants in the APOE gene (29).
