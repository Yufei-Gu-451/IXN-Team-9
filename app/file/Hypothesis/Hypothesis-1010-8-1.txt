Recent studies have shown that impaired mitochondrial function in the skeletal muscle may be involved in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance (5-7). These reports raise the possibility that systemic oxidative stress may contribute to lower aerobic capacity and skeletal muscle dysfunction in patients with MetS. Respiratory gas analysis was simultaneously performed with a breath-by-breath apparatus (Aeromonitor AE-300S; Minato Medical Science, Osaka, Japan), and peakVO2was measured. After at least 30 min rest, high-energy phosphate metabolism in the calf muscle was measured during plantar flexion exercise in supine position on the original apparatus equipped with a 1.5-Tesla whole-body scanner system (Magnetom Vision VB33G; Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) using31P-MRS, as previously described (10). Data are expressed as means +/- SD. Based on the previous report that compared the marker of oxidative stress between control subjects and patients with MetS (22), a sample size of 13 subjects in each group was needed to detect the effect compared with the threshold change of 0 under the conditions of alpha = 0.05 and beta = 0.2. After the initiation of constant load of 20% 1-RM exercise, PCr level in the calf muscle started to decrease and was finally stabilized within a few minutes in all subjects. Skeletal muscle energy metabolismIMCL content was higher in patients with MetS than control subjects (Table 2). 1None). In contrast, there was no significant difference in GPx activity between groups (Fig. 2). 2None). 2NoneandNone). There was a close relationship between systemic oxidative stress and impaired skeletal muscle energy metabolism (Fig. Because fatty acids are particularly prone to oxidative damage, lipid peroxidation products are easily formed in the skeletal muscle under the condition of increased ROS production, which can cause mitochondrial damage and subsequently decrease capacity for fatty acid oxidation (29).
