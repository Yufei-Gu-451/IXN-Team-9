Asian ethnic groups were further categorised into the following eight subgroups: Filipino, Chinese, Japanese, Indian/Pakistani, Korean, Vietnamese, Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, and others. Information on the prevalence of selected lifestyle factors for cancer and the use of CRC screening tests (colonoscopy and faecal occult blood testing) were derived from the 2009 California Health Interview Survey (CHIS) data using the askCHIS tool (http://ask.chis.ucla.edu/main/default.asp, access date: 17 February 2012). Korean women had lower proportions of screening tests (56.7%) than other Asian groups. In contrast to the decreasing trends in CRC incidence reported among all major racial/ethnic groups, CRC rates are actually increasing among some Asian subgroups, including the Korean population (GiddingsNone, 2012).
