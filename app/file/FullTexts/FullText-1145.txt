Cycloisomerization and cycloaddition reactions of enyne substrates have witnessed significant developments in the past decade due to their convenience and versatility in constructing complicated ring structures and useful intermediates in the synthesis of natural products. 1Among these myriad transformations, intramolecular/intermolecular [2+2+2] cycloadditions of triynes and enediynes catalyzed by transition metals have attracted even more attention, since these types of [2+2+2] cycloadditions can be applied to specifically build up the derivatives of benzene and cyclohexadiene. 2,3However, there are not many reports on such [2+2+2] additions catalyzed by the Grubbs ruthenium complex when searching through previous literature. 4-8Herein, we present an intramolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition of triynes catalyzed by the first-generation Grubbs ruthenium complex (Ru gen-1), which can efficiently afford benzene derivatives in good yields under mild conditions. Moreover, we also disclose a novel tandem cross-metathesis transformation of intramolecular enediynes catalyzed byRu gen-1in this paper, which has not been observed previously in related reports. Figure1shows the ruthenium catalysts that are used in this work of intramolecular cycloaddition and tandem cross-metathesis reactions of triynes and enediynes. Ru gen-1andRu gen-2are the first and second generation of Grubbs ruthenium complexes that have been widely used in olefin metathesis. Ru-3is the Hoveyda-Grubbs catalyst that was developed in the Hoveyda group. 9Ru-4is a modified Hoveyda-Grubbs catalyst developed by Zhan. 9cCatalyst kitsRu-5developed by Dixneuf's group has also been widely used in enyne metathesis. 10Ruthenium catalysts used in intramolecular cycloaddition and tandem cross-metathesis reactions of triynes and enediynes (Mes: 2,4,6-trimethylphenyl). Initial examination of the intramolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition of triynes was performed by using triyne1 a(0.1 mmol) as the substrate in the presence ofRu gen-1(10 mol %), and we found that the benzene derivative2 awas formed in 84 % yield within 12 h in styrene at room temperature (determined using1H NMR with 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene as an internal standard; Table1, Entry 1). Using 5 mol % ofRu gen-1as the catalyst, afforded2 ain 74 % yield (Table1, Entry 2). The reaction conditions were optimized, and the results are summarized in Table1. As shown, the examination of solvent effects revealed that dichloromethane is the suitable solvent, giving2 ain 88 %1H NMR yield (80 % isolated yield; Table1, Entries 3-7). Moreover, the yield of2 adecreased together with the catalyst loading ofRu gen-1from 10 to 5 mol % (Table1, Entry 8). On the basis of screening other ruthenium and rhodium catalysts, we found thatRu gen-1is the most efficient catalyst for this [2+2+2] cycloaddition, although2 acould be given in 85 % yield, when Ru(PPh3)2CpCl (10 mol %) was employed as the catalyst (Table1, Entries 9-12). Pd(PPh3)2Cl2or PtCl2did not catalyze this reaction under otherwise identical conditions (Table1, Entries 12-14). Thus, we identified that using dichloromethane as the solvent and 10 mol % ofRu gen-1as the catalyst,2 acould be obtained in the best yield (Table1, Entry 7). Optimization of the reaction conditions for the [2+2+2] cycloaddition reactions of intramolecular triynes catalyzed by Ru gen-1. [a]Reagents and conditions: triyne substrate1 a(0.2 mmol), catalyst, solvent (2 mL), RT, 12 h under argon. Yields were determined using1H NMR and 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene as an internal standard. Isolated yields. DCE: 1,2-dichloroethane, THF: tetrahydrofuran. Under the optimized reaction conditions, the substrate scope and limitations of the reaction were explored and the results are summarized in Table2. As for triyne substrates1 a-cbearing cyclopropane rings, the reactions proceeded smoothly to give the corresponding products2 a-cin 80-86 % yields (Table2, Entries 1-3). When triyne substrates1 d-g, which do not have a cyclopropyl group, were employed as substrates, the corresponding [2+2+2] cycloaddition products2 d-gcould be obtained in 66 %-94 % yields (Table2, Entries 4-7). Furthermore, using triyne substrates1 h-kin which R1, R2and R3are different substituents (R1or R2=nPr or Ph, R3=H; R1=R2=H, R3=Me or Ph) as the substrates, the desired products2 h-kwere obtained in moderate to good yields ranging from 55 % to 92 % (Table2, Entries 8-11). Finally, in the case of triyne substrate1 l, in which one carbon chain has been extended to a CH2CH2moiety, the corresponding product2 lwas also formed in 92 % yield (Table2, Entry 12). Their structures have been assigned by spectroscopic data. Moreover, product2 gis a known compound and its spectroscopic data are consistent with those in the literature. 11Substrate scope of the intramolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition reactions of triynes catalyzed by Ru gen-1. [a]Reagents and conditions:triyne substrate1(0.2 mmol),Ru gen-1(10 mol %), CH2Cl2(2 mL), RT, 12 h under argon. Isolated yields. Bs: bromobenzenesulfonyl, Ts: 4-toluenesulfonyl. Next, we attempted to explore the reaction outcome of enediynes, in which one terminal propargyl group in substrate1has been changed to a vinyl group, under standard conditions. Initial examination was performed by using enediyne3 a(0.1 mmol) as the substrate in the presence ofRu gen-1(10 mol %) in styrene at room temperature. As shown in Table3, we found that the intramolecular tandem cross-metathesis took place, affording4 ain 27 % isolated yield (Table3, Entry 1). The examination of solvent effects revealed that 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) is a suitable solvent for this tandem cross-metathesis (Table3, Entries 2-8). The other ruthenium catalysts, such asRu gen-2,Ru-3,Ru-4andRu-5, did not produce the desired product under similar conditions (Table3, Entries 9-12). Moreover, the additive effects such as styrene, Ti(OiPr)4, and hydroquinone have also been examined under the tentatively optimized conditions, but no significant improvement could be observed (for detailed results, see Table SI-1 in the Supporting Information). Eventually, we identified that using DCE as the solvent with 10 mol % of catalyst loading (Ru gen-1),4 acould be obtained in 52 % isolated yield at 70 degrees C within 12 h, which served as the best reaction conditions for this reaction (Table3, Entry 13). Optimization of the reaction conditions for the intramolecular tandem cross-metathesis reactions of enediynes. [a]Reagents and conditions: enyne substrate3 a(0.1 mmol), catalyst (10 mol %), solvent (1.0 mL), 12 h under argon. The yield was determined using1H NMR and 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene as an internal standard. Isolated yields. Ts: 4-toluenesulfonyl, THF: tetrahydrofuran, DMF:N,N-dimethylformamide, DCE: 1,2-dichloroethane. Under the optimized reaction conditions, the substrate scope and limitations of the reaction were also explored, and the results are summarized in Table4. As for substrates3 aand3 bbearing cyclopropane rings, the reaction proceeded smoothly to give the corresponding products4 aand4 bin 52 % and 54 % yields, respectively (Table4, Entries 1 and 2). When enediyne substrates3 c-h(R1=R2=R3=H; X=TsN, BsN, O or C; Y=O or TsN) were employed as substrates, the corresponding products4 c-hcould be obtained in 55 %-68 % yields, respectively (Table4, Entries 3-8). However, using enediyne substrate3 ior3 j, in which the terminal C atom of the propargyl group carries a methyl or phenyl group, the reaction gave complex product mixtures under the standard conditions (Table4, Entries 9 and 10). In the case of triyne substrates3 kand3 l, in which one carbon chain has been extended as a CH2CH2moiety, the corresponding hexatriene derivatives4 kand4 lwere afforded in 67 % or 75 % yields, respectively, rather than the cross-metathesis reaction products (Table4, Entries 11 and 12). On the basis of previous literature, it could be rationalized that the products4 kand4 lwere derived from the energetically favored 6pi-electrocyclization of the corresponding tandem cross-metathesis products. 12Finally, using enediyne substrate3 m, in which the terminal C atom of the allyl group is attached to a phenyl group, no reaction occurred under the standard conditions (Table4, Entry 13). Substrate scope of tandem intramolecular cross-metathesis reactions of enediynes catalyzed by Ru gen-1. [a]Reagents and conditions: substrate3(0.2 mmol),Ru gen-1(10 mol %), DCE (2.0 mL), 70 degrees C, 12 h under argon. Isolated yields. Derived from a 6pi-electrocyclization of the corresponding tandem cross-metathesis products. No reaction. Bs: bromobenzenesulfonyl, Ts: 4-toluenesulfonyl. It seems to us that the corresponding products4 a-hwere produced via a tandem cross-metathesis process, since Grubbs ruthenium complex (Ru gen-1) is also an effective catalyst in enyne metathesis. [4h, 4i]In order to gain more mechanistic insights into the reaction, we conducted an isotope labeling experiment to examine the reaction outcome by using dideuterated [D]-3 h(deuterium content=54 %) as the reactant, and the reaction was carried out under the standard conditions (Scheme1; for details, see the Supporting Information). It was found that product [D]-4 hcould be obtained in 60 % yield along with 54 % deuterium content, clearly suggesting a cross-metathesis process. Isotope labeling experiments (Ts: 4-toluenesulfonyl). On the other hand, using dideuterated substrate [D]-1 e(deuterium content greater than 80 %) in the reaction afforded the corresponding product [D]-2 ein 89 % yield along with 80 % deuterium content under the standard conditions (Scheme1; for details, see the Supporting Information), suggesting a specific intramolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition process. On the basis of the above results, the deuterium labeling experiments and the previous literature,8,13the mechanism for the formation of4is outlined in Scheme2by using [D]-3 has a reaction model. Initial reaction ofRu gen-1with the olefin moiety of [D]-3 hgenerates methylene ruthenium intermediateAalong with the release of dideuterated styrene. The intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition of carbene intermediateAwith the adjacent alkyne moiety produces ruthenacyclobuteneB, which undergoes a ring-opening process to give internal vinyl carbene intermediateC. Then, vinyl carbene intermediateCundergoes intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition with the second alkyne moiety to give another ruthenacyclobuteneD, which again undergoes a ring opening process to give carbene intermediateE. The reaction of intermediateEwith the released dideuterated styrene gives the desired product [D]-4 has well as the catalyst engaging in the next catalytic cycle (Scheme2). It should be noted that this intramolecular tandem cross-metathesis of enediynes could also be initiated from the terminal alkyne side (see Scheme SI-1 in the Supporting Information). However, because none of the desired products were formed in the cases of3 i,3 land3 m, at the present stage, we assumed that the mechanism shown in Scheme2might be more reasonable. A possible reaction mechanism for the formation of [D]-4 h(Ts: 4-toluenesulfonyl). In conclusion, we reported on intramolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition and tandem cross-metathesis reactions of triynes and enediynes, respectively, catalyzed byRu gen-1that can specifically produce the corresponding benzene derivatives2as well as the conjugated triene derivatives4in moderate to good yields. The real catalytic species is Ru-gen 1 rather than others. A plausible reaction mechanism for the formation of4has also been proposed on the basis of deuterium labeling experiments and the previous literature. Further investigations on the mechanistic details as well as the substrate scope of the reaction are in progress. Detailed descriptions of the experimental procedures as well as the spectroscopic data of the compounds shown inTables 1-4and the 2D spectra of4 hand4 l(COSY, NOESY, HMQC, HMBC and DEPT) are shown in the Supporting Information.
