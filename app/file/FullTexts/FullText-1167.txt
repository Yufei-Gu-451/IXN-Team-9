Leaf anatomical characteristics are key functional and adaptive traits determining plant capacity to thrive in specific environments, in particular, because these traits also have important implications for foliage potential photosynthesis (NiinemetsNone., 2009a;ScafaroNone., 2011;TerashimaNone., 2011). Analysis of global variations in leaf functional traits-the leaf economics spectrum-has established that the variation in leaf dry mass per area (MA) is strongly associated with other key leaf traits such as maximum photosynthetic capacity per dry mass (Amass), leaf life span, nitrogen and phosphorous contents per dry mass, and respiration (WrightNone., 2004). Species with lowerMApresent short leaf life spans, high photosynthetic capacities and nutrient contents, and low leaf area construction costs, resulting in fast growth in environments with high availability of resources. In contrast, species with higherMAand lowerAmasspresent the opposite suite of traits and have higher cost for leaf area formation, particularly due to investment in vasculature and cell walls (NiinemetsNone., 2007;Hikosaka Shigeno, 2009) and overall improved resistance to low fertility and drought, but low growth rates (Niinemets, 2001;WrightNone., 2004). It has been hypothesized that the negative relationship betweenMAand photosynthetic capacity is partly because of greater biomass investment in support tissues and cell wall thickening involving stronger CO2diffusion limitations to photosynthesis (Niinemets, 1999;WrightNone., 2004;NiinemetsNone., 2007)Mesophyll conductance to CO2(gm) is the measure of the CO2diffusion facility from substomatal cavities to the sites of carboxylation in the chloroplasts (FlexasNone., 2008,2012) Mesophyll conductance is finite and variable and plays a major role in constraining photosynthetic productivity (NiinemetsNone., 2009a). Large differences ingmhave been shown between and within species with different leaf forms and habits (FlexasNone., 2008;Warren, 2008;NiinemetsNone., 2009a,2011). Whilst rapid changes ofgmin response to environmental drivers probably depend on biochemical factors such as changes in the permeability of membranes to CO2facilitated by cooporins (HanbaNone., 2004;FlexasNone., 2006,2012), maximum values ofgmfor a given species or genotype are suggested to be related to leaf anatomical properties (NiinemetsNone., 2009a;TosensNone., 2012a). In particular, it has been shown that leaves with a more robust structure and higherMAexhibit lower photosynthetic rates due to large CO2drawdown from substomatal cavities (Ci) to chloroplasts (Cc),Ci-Cc, demonstrating that the photosynthetic capacity is limited bygm(FlexasNone., 2008,NiinemetsNone., 2009a). Therefore, understanding the structural and physiological basis of variation ingmis crucial for understanding photosynthetic controls in natural ecosystems and for breeding of plant cultivars with improved photosynthetic characteristics. At the leaf level, two components ofMA-leaf thickness and density-have been proposed to exert opposite effects on setting the maximumgm, with increases in thickness increasinggmand increases in density reducing it (NiinemetsNone., 2009b,HassiotouNone., 2010). Inside leaves, the CO2diffusion pathway consists of two phases, an intercellular gas phase and a cellular liquid phase, the latter consisting of aqueous and lipid components(Niinemets and Reichstein, 2003b;EvansNone., 2009). The gas phase pathway through intercellular air spaces is assumed to have a smaller effect on the overall diffusion limitations than the components of the liquid phase (EvansNone., 2009). This was confirmed in several studies comparing CO2diffusion in air and helox-air where helium replaces nitrogen to increase diffusivity-showing that the diffusion in the intercellular gas phase had little effect on photosynthesis (Parkhurst and Mott, 1990) The cellular phase is composed of the cell wall, plasma membrane, cytosol, and chloroplast envelopes and stroma. Among these components, the cell walls and chloroplast envelope have been suggested to limitgmmost severely (TerashimaNone., 2011). Accordingly, several reports have shown positive correlations betweengmand the surface of chloroplasts adjacent to intercellular air spaces (Sc/S), which is sometimes considered as the most important anatomical trait affectinggm(EvansNone., 1994;TerashimaNone., 2006;TholenNone., 2008). However, some estimates suggest that differences in cell wall thickness (Tcw) can explain as much as 25-50% of the variability ingm(EvansNone., 2009;TerashimaNone., 2011;TosensNone., 2012b). Negative correlations betweengmandTcwhave been shown when comparing AustralianBanksiaspecies (HassiotouNone., 2010), rice relatives (ScafaroNone., 2011), Eastern Australian species with varying anatomy (TosensNone., 2012b), and MediterraneanAbiesspecies (Peguero-PinaNone., 2012). Recently,TerashimaNone. (2011)showed thatgm/(Sc/S) decreases with increasingTcw, i.e. the relative influence of the exposed chloroplast surface in setting the maximumgmis variable, and that this variation can potentially be explained by variations inTcw. Few previous studies have quantitatively addressed the influence of leaf anatomical traits on the diffusion of CO2, and these studies have focused only on a few species and specific parts of the CO2diffusion pathway (EvansNone., 1994;TerashimaNone., 2006;HassiotouNone., 2010;ScafaroNone., 2011;Peguero-PinaNone., 2012;TosensNone., 2012b). Hence, the whole diffusion pathway of CO2from the substomatal cavities to the chloroplasts has not been quantitatively linked togmin plants with widely varying leaf structures and photosynthetic capacities. Furthermore, the overall importance ofgmin constraining the photosynthetic rate in species with different foliage architecture has not been characterized. To fill this gap, we aimed with the present study: (i) to analyse the role of different components of the diffusion pathway across a wide range of foliage architectures and leaf photosynthetic capacities; (ii) to associate the interspecific differences in leaf anatomy with the integrated leaf architectural traits such asMAandgm; (iii) to quantify the distribution of overall photosynthetic limitation among biochemistry, mesophyll diffusion, and stomata; and (iv) to quantify the resistance that each anatomical component exerts on the diffusion of CO2inside the leaf. Fifteen taxa of different growth form and leaf longevity were selected for the study to obtain an extensive range of variation in leaf morphology and anatomy (Supplementary Table S1atJXBonline). Five species were annual herbs (Capsicum annuum,Helianthus annuus,Phaseolus vulgaris,Spinacea oleracea,Ocimum basilicum) and the rest were broad-leaved trees: four deciduous (Acer negundo,Alnus subcordata,Betula pubescens,Catalpa speciosa), one semi-deciduous (Quercus brantii) and five evergreens (Quercus ilex,Citrus reticulata,Ficus elastica,Pittosporum tobira,Washingtonia filifera). All species were dicots, except for the palmWashingtonia filifera. All plants were grown either from commercial seed or from seeds collected in the field, except forF. elasticawhere rooted cuttings of a single mother plant were used. The plants were grown in a growth room with a 10h photoperiod, a day/night temperature of 24/18 oC, 60% air humidity, and a constant photon flux density of 350 umol m-2s-1at plant level provided by Philips HPI-T Plus 400W metal halide lamps. The daily integrated incident quantum flux density was 12.6mol m-2d-1. The growth substrate was a 1/1 mix of quartz sand and standard potting soil (Biolan Oy, Finland) including slow-release NPK (3/1/2 ratio) fertilizer with microelements, and the plants were irrigated daily to soil field capacity. The size of the pots varied between 1 and 5 l depending on plant age and size. In all cases, fully developed young (current-season leaves in evergreens) leaves were used for the measurements. In herbs, the plants were measured 1 month after seed germination, whilst woody species were measured on the second growing year. All physiological and structural analyses were replicated with at least three independent plants per taxa. Attached leaves were used for simultaneous leaf gas-exchange and chlorophyll-fluorescence measurements using a portable gas exchange fluorescence system GFS-3000 (Walz, Effeltrich, Germany) equipped with a leaf chamber fluorometer with an 8cm2cuvette window area. Light was provided by the LED light source of the leaf chamber fluorometer (10% blue and 90% red light) and the humidity was controlled by a built-in GFS-3000 humidifier. Use of a certain fraction of blue light is routinely used in portable photosynthesis devices to induce stomatal opening. Although blue light is absorbed more strongly by the upper leaf layers and may lead to discrepancies among photosynthesis and fluorescence profiles (Evans and Vogelmann, 2006), thereby alteringgmestimations by the combined gas-exchange/fluorescence techniques (LoretoNone., 2009), the amount of blue light used in our study was small and the expected effect minor. The standard conditions for leaf stabilization in the cuvette were: leaf temperature of 25 oC, saturating quantum flux density of 1500 umol m-2s-1, and CO2concentration in the cuvette (Ca) of 385 umol CO2mol air-1. Once the steady-state conditions were reached, typically 15-20min after clamping the leaf in the cuvette, CO2response curves of net assimilation (AN) were measured. First,Cawas lowered stepwise from 385 to 50 umol CO2mol air-1and then raised again to 385 umol CO2mol air-1, and the leaf was kept at thisCauntil the originalANvalue was achieved. Next,Cawas increased stepwise from 385 to 1500 umol CO2mol air-1and returned again to 385 umol CO2mol air-1. In all cases, measurements ofANand steady-state fluorescence yield (Fs) were recorded after the gas-exchange rates stabilized at the givenCa. After recording theANvalue, a flash of saturating white light was given to determine the maximum fluorescence yield in light-adapted state (Fm'). After completion of the CO2response curves, the light was switched off and respiration rate in the dark (Rd) was determined. In calculations ofAN,Rd, and intercellular CO2concentration (Ci), corrections for the diffusion leakage of CO2into and out of the leaf chamber were included as described byFlexasNone. (2007). Leaf transmittance and reflectance measurements were conducted with a spectrometer (AvaSpec-2048-2; Avantes, Apeldoorn, The Netherlands) using an integrating sphere (ISP-80-8-R; Ocean Optics, Dunedin, FL, USA). Leaf absorptance (alpha) was calculated as 1 minus the sum of reflectance and transmittance. Three leaves of each species were measured, and within each leaf, three replicate measurements were made. Average absorptance across the 400-700nm region was used to characterize the fraction of incident photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the leaf. After the gas-exchange measurements, 1*1mm pieces were cut between the main veins from the same leaves for anatomical measurements. Leaf material was quickly fixed under vacuum with 4% glutaraldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1M phosphate buffer (pH 7.2). Afterwards, the samples were fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide for 1h and dehydrated in a graded ethanol series, followed by washing three times in propylene oxide. The dehydrated segments were embedded in Spurr's resin (Monocomp Instrumentacion, Madrid, Spain) and cured in an oven at 60 oC for 48h. Semi-thin (0.8 um) and ultrathin (90nm) cross-sections were cut with an ultramicrotome (Reichert Jung model Ultracut E). Semi-thin cross-sections were stained with 1% toluidine blue and viewed under an Olympus BX60light microscope. Photos were taken at 200* and 500* magnification with a digital camera (U-TVO.5XC; Olympus) to measure the leaf thickness and thickness of the palisade and spongy tissue layers (Supplementary Fig. S1A-C). Ultrathin cross-sections for transmission electron microscopy (TEM H600; Hitachi) were contrasted with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Photos were taken at 2000* magnification (Supplementary Fig. S1D-F) to measure the length of mesophyll cells and chloroplasts adjacent to intercellular air spaces and chloroplast width and thickness, and the volume fraction of intercellular air space calculated as:where SigmaSsis the total cross-sectional area of mesophyll cells,Wis the width of the section, andtmesis the mesophyll thickness between the two epidermises. Mesophyll (Sm/S) and chloroplast (Sc/S) surface area exposed to intercellular air spaces per leaf area were calculated separately for spongy and palisade tissues as described byEvansNone. (1994)andSyvertsenNone. (1995). The curvature correction factor was measured and calculated for each species according toThain (1983) for palisade and spongy cells by measuring their width and height and calculating an average width/height ratio. The curvature factor correction ranged from 1.16 to 1.4 for spongy cells and from 1.4 to 1.5 for palisade cells. All parameters were analysed at least in four different fields of view and at three different sections. Weighted averages based on tissue volume fractions were calculated forSm/SandSc/S. Tcwand cytoplasm thickness (Tcyt) were measured at 20 000-40 000* magnification depending on the species (Supplementary Fig. S1G-I). Three different sections per species and four to six different fields of view were measured for each anatomical characteristic. Micrographs were selected randomly in each section andTcwwas measured for two to three cells per micrograph. Ten measurements for spongy tissue and ten for palisade parenchyma cells were made for each anatomical trait, and weighted averages based on tissue volume fractions were calculated. All images were analysed with Image analysis software (ImageJ; Wayne Rasband/NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). The leaves were scanned at 300 dpi, and then oven dried at 70 C for 48h and their dry mass was estimated. Leaf area was determined from the images with Image J. From these measurements,MAwas calculated. Using the estimates of leaf thickness from anatomical measurements, leaf density (DL) was calculated asMAper unit leaf thickness (Niinemets, 1999). The chloroplastic hypothetical CO2compensation point (Gamma*) in the absence ofRdwas calculated from the Rubisco specificity factor (SC/O) as:using the average values forSC/Oreported byGalmesNone. (2005)for each different leaf habit (Supplementary Table S2atJXBonline). A sensitivity analysis showed that the precise value of Gamma* within the reported range did not significantly affect thegmestimates (Supplementary Table S3A atJXBonline). From chlorophyll fluorescence measurements, the actual photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (PSII) was determined fromFNoneand the maximum fluorescence yield during a light-saturating pulse of 4500 umol m-2s-1(Fm') following the method ofGentyNone. (1989):The linear electron transport rate on the basis of chlorophyll fluorescence (JF) was then calculated as:whereQis the photosynthetically active quantum flux density,alphais the leaf absorptance, and epsilonPSIIis the fraction of light absorbed by PSII. As routinely assumed, epsilonPSIIwas taken as 0.5 (LoretoNone., 1994;NiinemetsNone., 2005). Furthermore, thegmto CO2was estimated according toHarleyNone. (1992)as:whereRLis the respiration rate in the light. In this study,Rdwas used as a proxy forRL(GalleNone., 2009). In other studies, halfRdhas been used (PielNone., 2002;NiinemetsNone., 2005). However, as shown inSupplementary Table S3B, no significant differences ingmwere found when using the proxy forRL, and hence we concluded that selection of the appropriate value forRLis not a critical issue for ourgmestimates, confirming a previous sensitivity analysis (NiinemetsNone., 2006). The obtained values ofgmwere used to transform theAN-Ciresponse curves intoANversusCcresponse curves asCc=Ci-AN/gm. Finally,FarquharNone. (1980)model parameters, the maximum velocity of carboxylation (Vcmax) and the capacity for photosynthetic electron transport (Jmax) on the basis ofCcwere calculated according toBernacchiNone. (2002). Three replicates estimates ofgmwere available for every species. The curve-fitting method introduced byEthier and Livingston (2004) as applied byNiinemetsNone. (2005)was used to obtain an alternative estimate ofgm. This method is based on changes in the curvature ofANversusCiresponse curves due to finitegmsuch that theFarquharNone. (1980)model based onCiimperfectly fits the data (Ethier and Livingston 2004). Thus, includinggmas a fitted parameter significantly improves the model fit. Estimates ofJmax,Vcmax, andgmwere derived from fittingAN-Cicurves as previously described. Values of the Michaelis-Menten constant for CO2(Kc), and oxygen (Ko) and their temperature responses used for these estimations were fromBernacchiNone. (2002). Gamma* was calculated according to Eqn 2, andRdby gas exchange measurements at 385 umol CO2mol air-1. At least three plants per species were used to estimategm. The same leaves were used for estimation ofgmby theEthier and Livingston (2004) andHarleyNone. (1992)methods. The one-dimensional gas diffusion model ofNiinemets and Reichstein (2003a) as applied byTosensNone. (2012a)was employed to estimate the share of different leaf anatomical characteristics in determininggm. gmas a composite conductance for within-leaf gas and liquid components is given as:wheregiasis the gas phase conductance inside the leaf from substomatal cavities to outer surface of cell walls,gliqis the conductance in liquid and lipid phases from outer surface of cell walls to chloroplasts,Ris the gas constant (Pa m3K-1mol-1),Tkis the absolute temperature (K), andHis the Henry's law constant (Pa m3mol-1). gmis defined as a gas-phase conductance, and thusH/(RTk), the dimensionless form of Henry's law constant, is needed to convertgliqto corresponding gas-phase equivalent conductance (Niinemets and Reichstein, 2003a). In the model, the gas-phase conductance (and the reciprocal term,rias) is determined by average gas-phase thickness, DeltaLias, and gas-phase porosity,fias(fraction of leaf air space):where is the diffusion path tortuosity (m m-1) andDa(m2s-1) is the diffusion coefficient for CO2in the gas phase (1.51*10-5at 25 degrees C). DeltaLiaswas taken as half the mesophyll thickness. The partial determinants of the liquid-phase diffusion pathway (the reciprocal termri, whereistands either for cell wall, cytosol, or stroma conductance) were calculated as:where DeltaLi(m) is the diffusion path length in the corresponding component of the diffusion pathway,pi(m3m-3) is its effective porosity, andDwis the aqueous phase diffusion coefficient for CO2(1.79*10-9m2s-1at 25 degrees C). The dimensionless factorrf,iaccounts for the reduction ofDwcompared with free diffusion in water, and was taken as 1.0 for cell walls (Rondeau-MouroNone., 2008) and 0.3 for cytosol and stroma (Niinemets and Reichstein, 2003b). In addition,rf,ivalues for cytosol and stroma were estimated using a least-squares iterative analysis to assess the sensitivity ofgmto values ofrf,i(Supplementary Figs S2andS3atJXBonline). In this analysis,rf,iwas allowed to vary between 1 and 0.05, and the values ofrf,iwere varied within this range to minimize the difference between measured and modelledgm. Whilst this approach improved the agreement between modelled and measuredgm, the extreme values obtained forrf,iseemed unrealistic (Supplementary Figs S2andS3). piwas set to 1.0 for cytosol and stroma. There are no direct measurements of cell wall porosity, but it has been suggested that this parameter might vary withTcwamong species (TerashimaNone., 2006;EvansNone., 2009;TosensNone., 2012b). Therefore, given the heterogeneous series of species used in this experiment,piwas estimated using a least-squares iterative analysis assuming a hypothetical relationship between porosity andTcwas described byTosensNone. (2012b). Again, a least-squares iterative approach was employed to get the best fit between measured and modelledgm. Thepirange in this analysis was fixed at 0.028 (TosensNone., 2012b) for the thickest to 0.3 (Nobel, 1991) for the thinnest cell walls (Supplementary Table S5atJXBonline). We used an estimate of 0.0035 m s-1for both plasma membrane conductance (gpl) and chloroplast envelope conductance (genv) as previously suggested (EvansNone., 1994;TosensNone., 2012a). Carbonic anhydrase in cytosol and chloroplasts could facilitate the diffusion of CO2through the liquid phase. However, there is little evidence for the involvement of carbonic anhydrase ingmandAN(reviewed byFlexasNone., 2008,2012). Therefore, followingTosensNone. (2012a), we did not include the potential effect of carbonic anhydrase in our analysis. In previous studies, we scaled the total liquid-phase diffusion conductance bySc/Sratio (TosensNone., 2012a) that determines the number of parallel diffusion pathways from outer surfaces of cell walls to chloroplasts. Although, cell wall and plasmalemma resistances actually scale with theSm/Sratio, use ofSc/Shas been deemed to be appropriate, asSc/Sis generally close to theSm/Sratio (ScafaroNone., 2011;Peguero-PinaNone., 2012), i.e. there is little cell wall area free of chloroplasts. Even ifSc/Sis significantly smaller thanSm/S, the cytosolic distance between the neighbouring chloroplasts is generally large and this can still constrain the diffusion flux in interchloroplastial areas of cell wall (locally large cytosol conductance,gcyt;Fig. 1). However, the significance of thercytdepends on the other parts of the diffusion pathway as well. Illustration of the diffusion pathway in exposed cell wall areas lined with chloroplasts (path 1) and interchloroplastial areas (path 2). The diffusion pathway in leaf lipid and liquid phases includes cell wall, plasmalemma, cytosol (shown by red arrows), chloroplast envelope membranes, and chloroplast stroma (shown by dark green arrows). The effective diffusion path length in cytosol along path 1 is taken as the average distance of chloroplasts from the cell wall, DeltaLcyt,1, whilst the diffusion pathway length in interplastidial areas is determined by the distance between the chloroplasts and DeltaLcyt,1(Eqn 12). To explicitly assess the importance of diffusion of CO2through interchloroplastial areas, we considered two different pathways of CO2inside the cell, one for cell wall parts with chloroplasts and the other for interchloroplastial areas as described byTholenNone. (2012). For exposed cell wall portions lined with chloroplasts, the partial liquid phase conductance,gcel,1, inside the cell is given as:wherercyt,1andrst,1are cytosolic resistance from the plasmalemma inner surface to the outer surface of chloroplasts and the stromal resistance in the direction perpendicular to cell wall (Fig. 1), respectively, both calculated by Eqn 8. Forrcyt,1, the diffusion pathway length, DeltaLcyt,1, is given as the average distance between the chloroplasts and cell wall in cell wall areas lined by chloroplasts (Fig. 1), whilst forrst,1, DeltaLi, was taken as half of the chloroplast thickness, DeltaTchl/2. For the cell wall portions without chloroplasts, the partial conductance,gcel,2, is given analogously as:wherercyt,2is the cytosolic resistance from interchloroplastic cell wall portions towards the chloroplast andrst,2is the stromal conductance in a direction parallel with the cell wall (Fig. 1). The diffusion path length forrcyt,2(Eqn ), DeltaLcyt,2, is driven both by the distance between the neighbouring chloroplasts, chloroplast thickness, and chloroplast distance from the cell wall and was approximated as:where DeltaLchlis the distance between the neighbouring chloroplasts. DeltaLcyt,2was calculated as a harmonic average, which more correctly represents the diffusion pathway ofrcyt,2. Finally, the diffusion pathway length forrst,2was taken as a quarter of the chloroplast length. Considering further that the fraction of exposed cell wall area lined with chloroplasts is given bySc/Smand the fraction free of chloroplasts as 1 -Sc/Sm, the total cellular conductance (sum of parallel conductances) is given as:Total liquid phase conductance from the outer surface of cell walls to carboxylation sites in the chloroplasts is the sum of serial conductances in the cell wall, plasmalemma, and inside the cell:Alternatively, the total cellular diffusion pathway can be considered to consist of two parallel pathways from the outer surface of the cell walls to the chloroplasts, one pathway corresponding to the diffusion flux through cell wall areas lines with chloroplasts and the other without chloroplasts:Although Eqns 14 and 15 are conceptually different, the values of conductances calculated by both equations were very similar, differing at most by 4%. In the current study, we have used Eqn 14. To separate the relative controls onANresulting from limited stomatal conductance (ls), mesophyll diffusion (lm), and limited biochemical capacity (lb) (ls+lm+lb=1), we used the quantitative limitation analysis ofJones (1985) and implemented byGrassi and Magnani, (2005). The limitations of the different components were calculated as:wheregsis the stomatal conductance to CO2,gmwas according toHarleyNone. (1992, Eqn 5), andgtotis the total conductance to CO2from ambient air to chloroplasts (sum of the inverse serial conductancesgsandgm). deltaAN/deltaCcwas calculated as the slope ofAN-Ccresponse curves over aCcrange of 50-100 umol mol-1. At least three curves per species were used, and average estimates of the limitations were calculated. The determinants ofgmwere divided between the component parts of the diffusion pathway (Eqns 6-8). The proportion ofgmdetermined by limited gas-phase conductance (lias) was calculated as:The share ofgmby different components of the cellular phase conductances (li) was determined as:whereliis the component limitation in the cell walls, the plasmalemma, and inside the cells, andgirefers to the component diffusion conductances of the corresponding diffusion pathways. To determine the limitations derived from the different components inside the cell (cytoplasm, chloroplast envelope, and stroma), weighted limitations of both pathways, the fraction of exposed cell wall area lined with chloroplasts and the fraction free of chloroplasts, were used. Regression and correlation analyses were conducted using the Sigma Plot 10.0 software package (SPSS; Chicago, IL, USA). Univariate analysis of variance was performed to reveal differences between species in the studied characteristics. Differences between means were revealed by Tukey analyses (P less than 0.05). These analyses were performed with the IBM SPSS statistics 19.0 software package (SPSS). MAvaried sixfold (20-123g m-2) (Supplementary Table S4atJXBonline). The variation in leaf thickness was 3.7-fold withAcer negundohaving the thinnest (123 um) andF. elasticathe thickest (459 um) leaves. Spongy mesophyll thickness varied 5.2-fold, and palisade mesophyll thickness 2.5-fold (Supplementary Table S4). Generally, the palisade tissue comprised approximately 40%, and spongy tissue approximately 60% of total mesophyll, except for some species asF. elasticawith 75% andW. filiferawith 100% of spongy tissue. The variation inDLwas 6.4-fold withPhaseolus vulgarishaving the least dense (0.11g cm-3) andQ. ilexthe most dense (0.70g cm-3) leaves. MAexhibited a significant positive correlation withDL(Supplementary Fig. S4atJXBonline), but was weakly correlated with leaf thickness (r2=0.27,P less than 0.05; data not shown). Therefore, the variation inMAwas mainly attributed to the leaf density. Among the leaf ultrastructural characteristics estimated from transmission electron micrographs (Supplementary Tables S4andS5, andSupplementary Fig. S1D-I),Sm/Svaried 3.3-fold across all species (14.4-40 m2m-2) andSc/Svaried 2.7-fold (6-19.7 m2m-2). Sc/Smvaried between 0.31 (Citrus reticulata) and 0.74 (O. basilicum). ForTcw(Supplementary Fig. S1G-I), 4.8-fold variation was observed between all species (113.6-543.7nm). Herbaceous species exhibited the thinnest cell walls together withCatalpa speciosa, whilst evergreens had the thickest cell walls with the maximum value of 543.7nm observed inPittosporum tobira. The values ofgmcalculated according to the methods ofHarleyNone. (1992)andEthier and Livingston (2004) were strongly correlated (Supplementary Fig. S5atJXBonline,r2=0.80). However, the Harleyet al. -based estimates exhibited the smallest average coefficient of variation for independent estimates within a species and therefore we report the data obtained with this method only. Mesophyll conductance calculated by the method ofHarleyNone. (1992)varied 24-fold across all species. H. annuusshowed the maximum values andCitrus reticulatathe minimum values ofgm. The minimum value for the coefficient of variation ingmwas 1.9% (Pittosporum tobira), whilst the maximum value was 32.9% (Q. ilex). The average of the coefficient of variation for all species was 16.5%. Net assimilation rate correlated positively withgsandgm(Supplementary Fig. S6atJXBonline). Ci-Ccranged from 240 to 112 umol mol-1in woody deciduous and evergreen species, and had lower values (40-67 umol mol-1) in herbs. Ci-Ccdecreased with increasinggm(Supplementary Fig. S7atJXBonline). This relationship was qualitatively identical whengmwas expressed on the leaf area or dry mass basis (data not shown). gmper dry mass was negatively associated withMA(r2= 0.85,P less than 0.0005; data not shown). gmper unit leaf area or per unit dry mass (data not shown) was not correlated withSm/S, reflecting the circumstance thatSm/Swas almost invariable, between 16 and 24 m2m-2across the species. Sc/Swas not significantly correlated withgm(Fig. 2A,P greater than 0.13). However, a positive correlation betweengmandSc/Swas observed when the species with the largestTcw(Pittosporum tobiraandQ. brantii) were not included in the correlation (r2=0.77,P less than 0.0001; data not shown). Correlations of mesophyll diffusion conductance (gm) determined according toHarleyNone. (1992)with the surface area of chloroplasts exposed to intercellular airspaces per unit leaf area (Sc/S) (A), mesophyll diffusion conductance with chloroplast surface area per leaf density ((Sc/S)/DL) (B), and mesophyll diffusion conductance perSc/S(gm/(Sc/S)) withTcw(C). In the main panels, the data were fitted by linear (B) and non-linear (C) regressions in the formy=ae-None. In the inset, the data were fitted by linear regression. Different species are represented as: herbs (circles), woody deciduous and semi-deciduous species (triangles), and woody evergreen species (squares). Values are means +/-standard error (SE) of three to four replicates per species. The positive and significant correlation (r2=0.84,P less than 0.001) betweengmand (Sc/S)/DLsuggested the importance of the anatomical components to the internal diffusion of CO2(Fig. 2B). Moreover, the negative and significant relationship observed betweengm/(Sc/S) andTcwshowed the importance ofTcwin affectinggm(Fig. 2C). Using the leaf anatomical traits measured,gmwas modelled and compared withgmmeasured by the method ofHarleyNone. (1992). A good positive linear relationship between modelled and measuredgmwas observed (r2=0.90,P less than 0.0001;Fig. 3). However, the slope was different from unity, so that thegmmodelled tended to be overestimated in species with highMAand underestimated in species with lowMA. gmvalues calculated by the model based on leaf anatomy ranged between 0.217 and 0.056mol m-2s-1. H. annuusshowed the largest andW. filiferathe smallest values ofgm. The coefficient of intraspecific variation ingmestimates for different replicates was lower than for the experimental estimations, being between 1.2% (Betula pubescens) and 22% (Pittosporum tobira). The relationship between mesophyll diffusion conductance (gm) measured with Harleyet al. method andgmmodelled with anatomical parameters (Eqn 6-15). Values are means +/-SE of three replicates per species. Symbols are the same as inFig. 2. The data were fitted by linear regression. Broken lines correspond to the 1:1 relationship. According to quantitative limitations analysis ofAN, stomatal openness andgmrestricted the photosynthetic capacity to a similar percentage, 19-65% and 13-64%, respectively. However, the biochemical limitations were lower than the stomatal and mesophyll limitations, being between 6 and 33% (Fig. 4A-C). Both the stomatal and biochemical components tended to be more important in species with non-sclerophytic leaves (lowMA), whilst mesophyll diffusion limitation was most significant in species with highMA(Fig. 4). Thus, herbaceous plants showed the maximum values for stomatal limitations, whilst the maximum mesophyll limitations were observed in evergreen species with more robust foliage structure. Quantitative limitation analysis of photosynthetic CO2assimilation and mesophyll conductance to CO2(gm) in relation to the leaf dry mass per area (MA). The stomatal (A), mesophyll (B), and biochemical (C) limitations of photosynthetic assimilation were calculated according to Eqns 16-18. Limitations analyses were based on a chloroplastic CO2concentration (Cc) range of 50-100 umol mol-1. Quantitative limitations ofgmdue to different anatomical components of the diffusion pathway were calculated using leaf anatomical characteristics (Eqns 19 and 20). The relative CO2diffusion limitations separated were: intercellular spaces (D), cell wall thickness (E), cytoplasm (F), plasmalemma (G), chloroplast envelope (H), and chloroplast stroma (I). From the different components of the whole diffusion pathway of CO2, the percentage limitations ofgmwere estimated (Fig. 4D-I). Intercellular air spaces represented a smaller resistance to the CO2diffusion (4-22%) than the cellular phase, because the rate of CO2diffusion in air was larger than in water. In the cellular phase, the cell walls appeared to be the most important factor that limited the internal diffusion of CO2in the species that presented a highMA. However, the plants with lowMAthat presented a low percentage of limitation ofgmby the cell wall revealed a higher limitation by the stroma of around 43%. On the other hand, the plasmalemma and chloroplast envelope accounted for only up to 8% of the limitation. The range ofgmvalues observed in our study is representative of the whole range ofgmvalues described so far in large literature-based datasets, except that the maximumgmvalues found in the present study were somewhat lower than reported previously (FlexasNone., 2008;Warren, 2008,NiinemetsNone., 2009a). These relatively low maximum values were possibly due to moderate growth light intensity compared with full sun (PielNone., 2002;NiinemetsNone., 2009a). This explanation is consistent with the observations of a significant number of chloroplasts not closely facing the cell walls (Fig. 2A) and relatively low ratios of chloroplast exposed to mesophyll exposed cell wall surfaces (Sc/Sm) (Supplementary Table S4), both being traits that depend on the growth light environment (TerashimaNone., 2006). As in previous studies,gmshowed a high degree of correlation with several leaf anatomic characteristics, notably a negative correlation withMA(FlexasNone., 2008;NiinemetsNone., 2009a,b) and a positive correlation withSc/S(EvansNone., 1994,2009). TheMAeffect ongmsupports the idea thatgmdepends on species differences in leaf density, as density was positively correlated withMA, whilst leaf thickness showed a weak correlation. The photosynthetic capacity was also significantly and positively correlated withgmas demonstrated previously (reviewed byFlexasNone., 2008;NiinemetsNone., 2009a).Overall, these results suggest that, in species with highMA, photosynthesis is more limited bygm, as indirectly supported by the negative effect of leaf density ongm(Niinemets, 1999) and more directly evidenced by the fact that they present higher values ofCi-Cc(Warren, 2008;NiinemetsNone., 2009a). The relative contribution ofgs,gm, and photosynthetic biochemistry to total photosynthesis limitation (followingGrassi and Magnani, 2005) was variable and depended on leaf structural characteristics, i.e. MA(Fig.4A-C). At a typical operating CO2concentration, the biochemical limitations of photosynthesis decreased from a maximum of approximately 33% at lowMAto minimum values asMAincreased, whilst, in parallel, mesophyll diffusion limitations increased from a minimum of approximately 15% to maximum values up to 65%. Stomatal limitations showed a less clear variation withMA. Overall, these data demonstrated that species with lowMAshowed a notable coordination of the limiting factors for photosynthesis, i.e. they were similarly co-limited by stomatal, mesophyll, and biochemical limitations. In contrast, species with highMAwere mostly limited by mesophyll (on average by 57%) and stomatal (30%) diffusion, and were less limited by biochemistry (13%). This is consistent with the idea that species with thicker and denser leaves, e.g. evergreen trees, are more limited bygmthan species with thinner leaves (GalmesNone., 2007;NiinemetsNone., 2011). The fact thatgmand mesophyll diffusion limitations were strongly correlated withMAsuggested that interspecific variations ingmare driven by leaf structural characteristics. Among the key structural traits suggested to limit CO2diffusion the most are the traits that alter effective diffusion path length and area for diffusion, in particularTcw, and chloroplast distribution along the exposed mesophyll cell wall (Fig. 2;EvansNone., 2009), although the role of other variables, such as leaf porosity, and the path lengths for CO2through the plasmalemma and chloroplast envelope membranes, cytosol, and stroma cannot be ruled out (EvansNone., 2009). In the present study, we modelledgmconsidering all major leaf structural traits as described byTosensNone. (2012a). A high significant positive correlation between measured and modelledgmestimates was found (Fig. 3). This correlation supports the view that at least a significant proportion of the interspecific variations ingmis somehow related to differences in the thickness of the structures involved in CO2diffusion, as well as to the number of parallel CO2diffusion pathways determined bySc/S. Despite the high correlation, the slope of the relationship was not unity, so that the biggest discrepancies between measured and modelled estimates ofgmwere found at the higher and lower ends ofgm. A similar discrepancy was observed in different Australian sclerophyll species occurring in the field under different soil nutrients and water availabilities, especially at high values ofgm(TosensNone., 2012b). This strong discrepancy between measured and modelled values may arise from the inherent uncertainties associated with both estimates. As for theHarleyNone. (1992)approach, besides the small variability in the estimates associated with uncertainties in the exact values ofRLand Gamma* (Supplementary Table S3), it has recently been shown thatgmcannot be considered as a purely diffusional component, but instead intrinsically includes a flux-weighted quantity related to the amount of respiratory and photorespiratory CO2from the mitochondria diffusing towards the chloroplasts (TholenNone., 2012). Concerning the anatomically based model used here, the precise outputs largely depend on a number of variables assumed as constants or inferred indirectly. For instance, the reduction inDwcompared with free diffusion in water (rf,i) was considered constant for all species, although different for cell wall and intercellular components. Bothgplandgenvwere also taken as constant, whilst cell wall porosity (pi) was indirectly estimated fromTcwusing an empirical equation. There is not sufficient knowledge for the actual values of all these parameters, and they may vary among species, hence contributing to most of the observed slope discrepancy. It can be seen, for instance, that the difference between measured and modelledgmalmost disappeared when therf,ivalues were calculated using a least-squares iterative analysis (Supplementary Fig. S2). However, this 'perfect correspondence' is bound to some probably non-realisticrf,ivalues as low as 0.05. Moreover, values ofgmhave been modelled considering CO2diffusivities in the different media involved-assumed to be either 'pure' air, lipid, or aqueous phases with fixed thicknesses, whilst, in most cases, determination of the thickness of the given phase is not that straightforward. Also, we assumed no facilitation mechanism that could improve the diffusivities in lipid and aqueous phases. Among these, membrane-bound aquaporins (UehleinNone., 2003,2008;HanbaNone., 2004;FlexasNone., 2006) and cytosol and stromal forms of carbonic anhydrases (PriceNone., 1994;Gillon and Yakir, 2000) are likely candidates (TerashimaNone., 2011). For instance, allowinggpland/orgenvto vary within the range of published values (EvansNone., 2009) also results in a better agreement between the measured and modelled values (Supplementary Fig. S8atJXBonline). In summary, current uncertainties about the actual values of these parameters and their variability among species preclude the development of a truly predictive anatomically based model forgm. However, the good correlation, despite the divergent slope, can be taken as strong evidence that a substantial part ofgmis indeed dependent on a series of leaf anatomical features. Despite the discussed limitations of the model approach used here, the results suggest that chloroplast distribution andTcware the most influential leaf structural characteristics in setting the limits forgm(EvansNone., 2009;TerashimaNone., 2011). In particular, a significant positive correlation was found betweengmandSc/Sonly when species with very largeTcw(Q. brantiiandPittosporum tobira) were excluded, highlighting the fact that the impact of chloroplast distribution ongmbecame less important asTcwincreased, in agreement with past suggestions (TerashimaNone., 2006,2011). In addition, a highly significant negative relationship was observed between the ratiogm/(Sc/S) andTcwconsidering all species, similar to that obtained byTerashimaNone. (2011)pooling literature data. Using a limitation analysis to separate the contributions of the components ofgm(Eqns 13 and 14) revealed that, globally, the limitation imposed byTcwspanned the most, ranging from approximately 4 to 70% (Fig. 4E). This was followed by chloroplast stroma, which ranged from 4 to 46% (Fig. 4F,I). However, the limitations inside the cell (cytosol and stroma) could be underestimated, especially in species with highMA, asgmwas modelled assuming that cytosolic and stromal viscosity (rf,i) was constant in all species. The limitations imposed by intercellular air spaces, the plasmalemma, and the chloroplast envelope were much smaller than the rest of the diffusion pathway components as was observed byTosensNone. (2012a,b). The fact that the latter two components had only a moderate effect on limitinggmis in conflict with the observed largergmchanges observed in aquaporin mutant plants without any appreciable differences inSc/Sor any other leaf structural characteristic (FlexasNone., 2006). This could be due to the fact that the assumed values forgplandgenvare constant among species, which may not necessarily be the case. Differences of up to four orders of magnitude have been reported for CO2permeabilities of biological membranes. For instance, if the permeability for a given species was 0.00002 m s-1, as found for chloroplast envelopes byUehleinNone. (2008), instead of the 0.0035 m s-1used in the present simulation, the combined limitation togmimposed could be larger than 40% (data not shown). At the other extreme, if values were closer to the 0.016 m s-1reported byMissnerNone. (2008)for lipid bilayers, the maximum modelledgmvalues will be closer to estimates based by theHarleyNone. (1992)approach (data not shown). Clearly, improved knowledge on the actual permeability to CO2of biological membranes is required to fully understand the basis for the regulation ofgm. Despite these general tendencies, the impact of each specific leaf component ongmchanged withMA. Specifically, the limitations imposed byTcwstrongly increased with increasingMA, whilst the limitations associated with all the other components decreased with increasingMA. Thus, in species with lowMA, like annual herbs, about 60% of the total limitation togmis imposed by cytoplasm and stroma, whilst another 12% is accounted for by the plasmalemma and chloroplast envelope. Moreover, in species with thinner leaves, the fraction of exposed cell wall lined with chloroplasts (gcel,1) was higher, whilst limitations inside the cell through interchoroplastial areas (gcel,2) were more important in species with higherMA(Fig. S9atJXBonline). This suggests that it is in such species where facilitating mechanisms (aquaporins, carbonic anhydrases, chloroplast movements, and others) have the strongest influence ongm. In contrast, in species with highMA, like evergreen sclerophylls,gmis mostly (up to 70%) limited byTcw, which is likely to be less variable in the short term, and may explain the low photosynthetic capacity displayed by these plants even under non-limiting conditions. Possible interspecific variation in the role of aquaporins in limitinggmis clearly a topic that deserves high priority in future studies. In conclusion, the present study showed that mesophyll limitations are crucial in determining the maximum photosynthetic capacity when a large range of leaf types are analysed collectively. These limitations are variable depending on the leaf structural properties, i.e. MAand associated structural traits such as leaf density. The variability in mesophyll diffusion limitations was explained mainly by variations in the rate of CO2diffusion pathways through cell walls, as well as the area for diffusion determined by the chloroplast distribution. However, the impact of each component of the diffusion pathway largely depended onMA, so that CO2diffusion in species with thin leaves (e.g. herbs) depends more on membranes and aqueous compartments-and is probably more influenced by aquaporins and carbonic anhydrases. In contrast, diffusion in species with thick leaves is almost fully determined by cell wall conductance. Altogether, the variability ingmwithMAhelps explain the worldwide leaf economics spectrum showing a negative dependency between photosynthetic capacity andMA.
