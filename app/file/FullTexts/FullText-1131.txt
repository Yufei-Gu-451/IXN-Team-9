Common wheat (Triticum aestivumL.) is one of the 'big three' cereal crops used for human food (Shewry, 2009) since wheat grains confer their viscoelastic properties to wheat dough (ShewryNone., 1995). These viscoelastic properties allow dough to be incorporated into a wide range of daily food products, which are affected by glutenin and gliadin proteins in wheat seeds (ShewryNone., 1995;D'Ovidio and Masci, 2004;Juhasz and Gianibelli, 2006). Glutenin proteins are composed of two groups of subunits, namely high-molecular-weight and low-molecular-weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS, 65-90kDa; LMW-GS, 30-45kDa) (Payne, 1987;D'Ovidio and Masci, 2004). The LMW-GS account for about one-third of the seed protein and 60% of glutenin proteins, and play an important role in determining dough properties and the quality of wheat food products (GuptaNone., 1991,1994;BranlardNone., 2001;EaglesNone., 2002;HowittNone., 2006). Thus, elucidating the composition and variation of LMW-GS genes in common wheat and investigating the relationship between allelic variants and end-use quality are of interest for wheat quality improvement (GuptaNone., 1994;HeNone., 2005;BekesNone., 2006;Juhasz and Gianibelli, 2006;LiuNone., 2010;ZhangNone., 2012). LMW-GS genes form a multigene family in common wheat, generally located at theGlu-A3,Glu-B3, andGlu-D3loci on the short arms of homoeologous group 1 chromosomes (JacksonNone., 1983). The copy number of LMW-GS genes was estimated to range from 10-20 to 30-40 (IkedaNone., 2002;D'Ovidio and Masci, 2004;Juhasz and Gianibelli, 2006;Huang and Cloutier, 2008;DongNone., 2010;ZhangNone., 2011None,None). In Norin 61, 12 groups of LMW-GS genes were identified by screening the cDNA library (IkedaNone., 2006). In Glenlea, among the 12 active genes, one was assigned to chromosome 1A, two to chromosome 1B, and nine to chromosome 1D (Huang and Cloutier, 2008). In Xiaoyan 54, 14 unique LMW-GS genes were identified using BAC (bacterial artificial chromosome) library screening and proteomics analysis, of which four were located atGlu-A3, three atGlu-B3, and seven atGlu-D3. Of the 11 active genes, two, two, and seven were i-, s-, and m-type genes, respectively (DongNone., 2010). The above three varieties contained different LMW-GS gene compositions, suggesting that this gene family has high molecular diversity among wheat varieties (DongNone., 2010). Moreover, these LMW-GS proteins had similar physical and chemical properties and molecular weights to the gliadins, which are a type of alcohol-soluble, monomeric seed storage protein. The high copy number and their co-migration with gliadins by SDS-PAGE (sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) and MALDI-TOF MS (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry) made separation of LMW-GS proteins and isolation of all LMW-GS genes from a particular wheat variety difficult (HowittNone., 2006). Thus, characterization of the allelic variation of LMW-GS genes in wheat germplasm remains challenging. To dissect the LMW-GS complex, a nomenclature system was developed based on their relative mobility in SDS-PAGE (SinghNone., 1991). Recently, their encoding genes were isolated using PCR with gene-specific primers. One m- and two i-type LMW-GS genes (GluA3-1,GluA3-2, andGluA3-3) were isolated from eachGlu-A3allele (WangNone., 2010). At theGlu-B3locus, four LMW-GS genes (GluB3-1,GluB3-2,GluB3-3, andGluB3-4) and their allelic variants were isolated from nineGlu-B3alleles (Glu-B3a-Glu-B3i) (WangNone., 2009). Also, sixGlu-D3genes were identified from individual wheat varieties containingGlu-D3a-Glu-D3e(ZhaoNone., 2006,2007). Meanwhile, allele-specific markers were developed to discriminate LMW-GS genes and their allelic variants in common wheat (ZhaoNone., 2007;AppelbeeNone., 2009;WangNone., 2009,2010). These markers facilitated identification of the knownGlu-A3andGlu-B3alleles used in breeding programmes (LiuNone., 2010). However,Glu-D3genes were highly conserved, and allelic identification using PCR markers was difficult (LiuNone., 2010). In contrast, these allele-specific primers characterized only one or two genes in individual alleles, and could not be used to determine the exact composition of LMW-GS genes in individual varieties. To determine the composition of LMW-GS genes in individual wheat varieties, the LMW-GS gene molecular marker system and the full-length gene-cloning method were developed (ZhangNone., 2011None,None), which enabled identification and characterization of the complete sequences of all LMW-GS genes in any wheat variety. In the present study, using both methods, LMW-GS genes were investigated in the micro-core collections (MCC) of Chinese wheat germplasm, which covers greater than 70% of the genetic diversity of Chinese wheat germplasm (HaoNone., 2011). The composition, organization, allelic variation, and expression of LMW-GS genes in 262 MCC accessions were comprehensively investigated. The MCC of Chinese wheat germplasm were obtained from the Institute of Crop Science, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS). This was a representative sample of Chinese wheat diversity. This collection consisted of 262 accessions including 88 modern varieties, 157 landraces, and 17 foreign varieties, which accounted for greater than 70% of the genetic diversity of the national collection. Genomic DNAs of 262 MCC accessions were extracted from young leaves of seedlings with the cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB method) followingSaghai-MaroofNone. (1984). The LMW-GS genes in all the MCC accessions were separated using the LMW-GS gene molecular marker system (ZhangNone., 2011b). Based on data from the marker system, 45 accessions containing almost all allelic variants were selected for RNA analysis. Total RNA was prepared from developing seeds at 15-21 dpa (day post anthesis) using TRIzol(r)Reagent, according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The RNA was converted into cDNA using Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MLV) reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The expressed LMW-GS genes were detected using the molecular marker system (ZhangNone., 2011None). To obtain the full-length sequence of these LMW-GS genes, 30 representative varieties containing all the main allelic variants of each gene were selected. All genes were cloned and identified using the full-length gene cloning method (ZhangNone., 2011None). To clone rare allelic variants, gene-specific primers were developed (Supplementary Table S1available atJXBonline). Sequence analysis and characterization were performed using Lasergene software (DNAStar;http://www.dnastar.com/), ClustalW2 (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalw2/), and MEGA 5 software (KumarNone., 2008). LMW-GS genes in the MCC of Chinese wheat germplasm were amplified using the LMW-GS gene molecular marker system consisting of three independent sets of conserved primers (ZhangNone., 2011None). In general terms, at least 15 LMW-GS genes were identified in each wheat variety (Table 1). To characterize these LMW-GS genes further, 30 representative accessions containing the main allelic variants were selected, and all of their LMW-GS genes were cloned and sequenced using the full-length gene cloning method and gene-specific primers (Table 1;Supplementary Table S1atJXBonline) (ZhangNone., 2011None). In total, 466 LMW-GS gene sequences were identified and deposited in GenBank (JX877778-JX878243). LMW-GS genes and their allelic variants identified from MCC accessions using the LMW-GS gene molecular marker system. NoneLMW-GS genes and allelic variants were named according to the size of the DNA fragments amplified using the primer LMWGS1. For each gene, the major allelic variant was designated as the LMW-GS gene and the remainder as its variants. NoneThree sets of conserved primers in the LMW-GS gene molecular marker system (ZhangNone., 2011None). NoneNot detected with the specific primers. For each LMW-GS gene, several allelic variants were detected from the MCC (Table 1), some of which were identified previously (IkedaNone., 2006;ZhaoNone., 2006,2007;Huang and Cloutier, 2008;WangNone., 2009,2010;DongNone., 2010;ZhangNone., 2011None,None). Using available mapped LMW-GS genes and their allelic relationship with the genes identified from the MCC, all these genes were assigned to specific wheat chromosomes. In individual accessions, 4-6 genes were located at theGlu-A3locus, 3-5 at theGlu-B3locus, and eight at theGlu-D3locus (Table 1). These genes were named according to their DNA fragment size and chromosomal location. For example, the gene corresponding to DNA fragment 441.5, located at theGlu-D3locus, was designatedD3-441. Most of these genes contained several allelic variations across the MCC. To simplify description, the major allelic variant was selected to represent each LMW-GS gene and it was named according to the following scheme: 'DNA fragment+gene' (e.g. theA3-402gene), while the allelic variants of each gene were named according to 'DNA fragment+allele' (e.g. theA3-402allele). At theGlu-A3locus, 4-6 LMW-GS genes were detected in each accession and several allelic variants were identified for each gene in the MCC (Table 1;Fig. 1). With regard to theA3-391gene, five allelic variants,A3-353,A3-370a,A3-370b,A3-373, andA3-391, shared greater than 97% identity (Supplementary Fig. S1atJXBonline). TheA3-391allele predominated in 196 accessions, whileA3-353andA3-373were rare variants, each present in only two MCC accessions (Fig. 1a). Sequence analysis of theA3-391genes of 30 varieties confirmed that allelic variants showed length polymorphisms in the repetitive regions, and that each variant contained its own single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (Supplementary Fig. S1). A3-353,A3-373, andA3-391were highly conserved across the MCC population, whereas theA3-370allele could be further divided into two variants (A3-370aandA3-370b) due to SNPs in all available sequences (Supplementary Fig. S1). A3-353,A3-370a,A3-370b, andA3-391alleles contained immature stop codons, and only the rare alleleA3-373possessed an intact open reading frame (ORF) encoding an m-type subunit (Supplementary Table S2). Thus, theA3-391gene was universal in common wheat, even though only five sequences with greater than 98% identities were deposited in GenBank. Composition of LMW-GS genes at theGlu-3loci in micro-core collections (MCC) of Chinese wheat germplasm. The diagrams illustrate the LMW-GS genes and their allelic variants at theGlu-A3,B3, andD3loci identified from MCC accessions. The horizontal axis of each diagram shows the allelic variants of individual genes or haplotypes identified from the MCC. The vertical axis displays the composition of unique genes and haplotypes in individual accessions. The length of line segments represents the number of accessions containing the corresponding allelic variants. Underlined allelic variants were rare in the MCC, and allelic variants in red were active in common wheat. The allelic variants indicated by numbers and letters, such as 370a and 370b, shared the same DNA fragment but had different nucleotide sequences. (A) The compositions of genes and their allelic variants at theGlu-A3locus. The i-type genes showed high diversity and were tightly linked, forming specific haplotypes. (B) The compositions of genes and their allelic variants at theGlu-B3locus. The s-type genes were tightly linked and formed specific haplotypes. (C) The composition of eight genes and their allelic variants at theGlu-D3locus. TheA3-400gene was also common in wheat varieties. Seven allelic variants with different repetitive region lengths,A3-374,A3-388,A3-394,A3-400,A3-402,A3-408, andA3-411, were identified from MCC accessions (Fig. 1a). Sequence alignments suggested that theA3-374,A3-388,A3-400,A3-408, andA3-411alleles were conserved among wheat varieties, whereas bothA3-394andA3-402comprised two variants,A3-394aandA3-394b, andA3-402aandA3-402b, respectively, due to indels and SNPs in the available sequences (Supplementary Fig. S2atJXBonline). Sequence analysis also demonstrated thatA3-402aandA3-400shared the same SNP, containing a premature stop codon, while all remaining allelic variants (i.e. A3-374,A3-388,A3-394a,A3-394b,A3-402b,A3-408, andA3-411) contained intact coding sequences that might encode m-type LMW-GS in common wheat (Supplementary Fig. S2). Except for the m-type genes above, all the others identified at theGlu-A3locus were i-type genes (Fig. 1a;Supplementary Table S2atJXBonline). The coding sequences of allelesA3-480,A3-484,A3-487,A3-502, andA3-508contained a specific length of repetitive regions and unique SNPs. For the major variantA3-502, eight allelic variants (A3-502a-A3-502h) were recognized due to SNPs and indels in the coding sequences (Fig. 1a;Supplementary Fig. S3). For the other i-type genes, eight genes/haplotypes,A3-620,A3-626,A3-643,A3-646,A3-649,A3-573/A3-640,A3-567/A3-590, andA3-565/A3-568/A3-662, were detected, of which allelesA3-626andA3-646were further divided into two allelic variants, respectively, due to SNPs in the coding sequences. Moreover, two genes,A3-649-1andA3-649-2with unique SNPs and indels, which shared a 649bp DNA fragment, were identified from individual accessions; theA3-567-1andA3-567-2genes exhibited similar commonality. After analysing the composition of i-type genes in 262 MCC accessions, it was found that allA3-502variants were tightly linked with other unique i-type genes. TheA3-502aandA3-502balleles were coupled withA3-620,A3-502cwithA3-626a,A3-502dwithA3-643,A3-502ewithA3-646a,A3-502fwithA3-646b,A3-502gwithA3-573andA3-640, andA3-502hwithA3-649-1andA3-649-2. In total, 12 i-type haplotypes were identified in MCC accessions (Fig. 1a). Generally, excluding 11 1BL/1RS translocation lines, 3-5Glu-B3genes were identified in each MCC accession, andB3-530andB3-548genes were universal (Fig. 1b). With regard to theB3-530gene, three allelic variants,B3-510,B3-516, andB3-530, were identified (Table 1;Fig. 1b), and shared high sequence identity ( greater than 99%). TheB3-530allele was further divided into three variants (B3-530a,B3-530b, andB3-530c) due to the unique SNPs (Supplementary Fig. S4atJXBonline). All allelic variants of theB3-530gene possessed intact ORFs and their deduced proteins belonged to m-type LMW-GS. For theB3-548gene, theB3-548allele predominated in 241 accessions, while the rare allelic variantB3-557was detected in only one (Table 1;Fig. 1b). However, both variants contained premature stop codons in their coding sequences, suggesting them to be pseudogenes. The otherGlu-B3genes were identified only in partial MCC accessions (Fig. 1). TheB3-570gene was identified in 44 MCC accessions, and its intact ORF contained 344 amino acid residues and encoded an m-type gene with the novel N-terminal sequence, METSQIPGLEKPS. TheB3-578,B3-621, andB3-544genes were tightly linked at theGlu-B3locus and formed several haplotypes (Fig. 1b). TheB3-578gene was classified into two variants (B3-578aandB3-578b) based on two SNPs. TheB3-544genes were conserved among accessions, and the allelic variantsB3-544andB3-587-B3-607shared greater than 99% sequence identity (Supplementary Fig. S5atJXBonline). Also,B3-621andB3-624differed in only a CAA indel and an SNP (Supplementary Fig. S6). Moreover,B3-578contained two premature stop codons in its coding sequences, while the other genes possessed intact ORFs, which might be active in common wheat. Sequence analysis showed that all three genes were s-type, the deduced protein sequences of which contained a MENSHIPGLERPS peptide at the N-terminus. B3-688could be divided into three groups (B3-688a,B3-688b, andB3-688c) in MCC accessions, although several irregular SNPs were found in the coding sequences (Supplementary Fig. S6). These irregular SNPs were tightly linked withB3-691orB3-813at theGlu-B3locus, forming different haplotypes, namelyB3-688a/B3-691,B3-688b/B3-813, andB3-688c/N(Fig. 1b). B3-688awas coupled withB3-691, and shared greater than 99% identity, the only differences being a CAA indel and an SNP. B3-813was identified for the first time in common wheat and contained a premature stop codon in the ORF, while bothB3-688andB3-691had unbroken ORFs encoding s-type LMW-GS in common wheat. Eight LMW-GS genes (D3-385,D3-393,D3-394,D3-441,D3-525,D3-575,D3-578, andD3-586) were detected at theGlu-D3locus in individual wheat varieties (Table 1;Fig. 1c). NeitherD3-385norD3-575preserved any allelic variants and were universal in all MCC accessions. In terms of theD3-393gene, theD3-393 allele was present in 259 MCC accessions, while the other rare allelic variant,D3-385', was found in only three (Fengkang 2, Guinong 10, and Lovrin 10). For theD3-394gene, both allelic variants,D3-394andD3-397, shared greater than 99% sequence identities, the difference being an indel (CAA) and two SNPs; the latter allele was detected in only a single landrace, Yizhimai. Three conserved allelic variants ofD3-441(D3-432,D3-441, andD3-444) were identified with CAA indels in the repetitive region (Supplementary Fig. S7atJXBonline). The three allelic variants of theD3-525gene, namelyD3-522,D3-525, andD3-528, exhibited a similar phenomenon (Supplementary Fig. S8). For theD3-578gene,D3-578awas identical in length but had a different nucleotide sequence from that of the theD3-578bvariant (Supplementary Fig. S9). This gene encoded the only s-type LMW-GS at theGlu-D3locus in common wheat. The nucleotide sequences ofD3-586and its allelic variants were identical, except for the CAA indels in the repetitive region that contributed to the length polymorphism (Supplementary Fig. S10). Among the eight LMW-GS genes at theGlu-D3locus,D3-393was a pseudogene due to a frameshift mutation andD3-586was a pseudogene due to a premature stop codon. The remaining six genes contained intact ORFs that encoded one s-type (D3-578) and five m-type LMW-GS at theGlu-D3locus, which contained the largest number of active genes of all theGlu-3loci. Using the LMW-GS gene molecular marker system and the full-length gene cloning method (ZhangNone., 2011None,None), almost all LMW-GS genes were detected in the MCC and were cloned and characterized in 30 MCC accessions, which facilitated investigation of the organization of LMW-GS genes and their linkage relationship. At theGlu-A3locus, 4-6 genes were generally isolated from individual MCC accessions, includingA3-391,A3-400, and 2-4 i-type genes (e.g. A3-502aandA3-620;A3-502g,A3-573, andA3-640; andA3-484,A3-565,A3-568, andA3-662;Figs 1a,2a). Although several allelic variants were identified for each gene, only 11 main types ofGlu-A3genotypes were detected in MCC accessions, suggesting that these genes were tightly linked (Fig. 2a). Two genotypes containingA3-391,A3-400orA3-402a,A3-502, andA3-620accounted for ~70% of the MCC accessions, while each of the remaining genotypes accounted for less than 7% (Fig. 2a). Moreover, concerning the distribution of different genotypes in foreign accessions, Chinese modern varieties, and landraces, genotypes containing theA3-649-1/-2genes were detected only in landraces, while those containingA3-394a/bwere present in both foreign accessions and Chinese modern varieties (Fig. 2a). Main genotypes of LMW-GS genes atGlu-3loci identified from the MCC. Genotypes present in more than three MCC accessions are shown. LMW-GS genes at the same locus were generally linked and formed limited types of genotypes. Genes in red were active in common wheat. Moreover, the modern varieties, landraces, and foreign varieties are indicated by different colours. The genotypes most common in landraces are indicated by red asterisks, and those found only in modern and foreign varieties by blue asterisks. (A) Eleven genotypes at theGlu-A3locus. (B) Thirteen genotypes at theGlu-B3locus. Of these, 11 accessions without LMW-GS genes belong to 1B/1R translocation lines. (C) Fourteen genotypes at theGlu-D3locus. Based on the genotype data of MCC accessions, the linkage relationship among LMW-GS genes at theGlu-A3locus was analysed (Fig. 2a). First, four main haplotypes of i-type genes were detected in MCC accessions, namelyA3-502a/b/A3-620,A3-502/A3-646,A3-502h/A3-649-1/A3-649-2, andA3-484/A3-565/A3-568/A3-662(Figs 1a,2a). The i-type genes were completely linked and formed specific haplotypes in common wheat. Secondly, theA3-391allele was coupled with allelesA3-400andA3-402a, and theA3-370a/balleles co-segregated withA3-394b,A3-402b,A3-408, andA3-411(Fig. 2a). m-Type genes may have been tightly linked with each other at theGlu-A3locus. Thirdly, theA3-370a/balleles were generally coupled withA3-502(e/f)/A3-646andA3-484/A3-565/A3-568/A3-662, while theA3-391allele was linked withA3-502(a/b)/A3-620,A3-502h/A3-649-1/A3-649-2, andA3-502g/A3-573/A3-640(Fig. 2a). Thus, theA3-391gene generally linked with i-type genes in MCC accessions. At theGlu-B3locus, although 3-5 genes were present in individual accessions, their allelic variants consisted of 12 main genotypes in the MCC accessions (Figs 1b,2b). Genotypes containing allelic variantsB3-621,B3-624, orB3-688covered all MCC accessions, excluding 11 1BL/1RS translocation lines, and genotypes containing the haplotypesB3-688/NorB3-688/B3-691accounted for 54% of the MCC (Fig. 2b). Tight linkage of LMW-GS genes at theGlu-B3locus was also observed. TheB3-510allele was tightly coupled with theB3-570gene, forming the haplotypeB3-510/B3-570, which was generally linked with another haplotypeB3-688/B3-691(Fig. 2b). In contrast, s-type genes consisted of two groups of haplotypes at theGlu-B3locus; one contained theB3-621gene and the other theB3-688gene (Fig. 1b). The former group formed various haplotypes, which contained three unique LMW-GS genes, namelyB3-578,B3-544andB3-621, as well as their allelic variants. AllelesB3-544,B3-601,B3-604, andB3-607regularly co-segregated withB3-621, while the other variantsB3-590,B3-593, andB3-596were usually coupled withB3-624(Fig. 2b). In terms of the distribution of these genes in MCC, 1BL/1RS lines and genotypes containingB3-601andB3-604were identified only in foreign or modern varieties, whereas the genotypes containingB3-624and the genotypeB3-530/B3-548/B3-688/B3-691were detected mostly in landraces (Fig. 2b). At theGlu-D3locus, although eight LMW-GS genes were identified from individual accessions, few haplotypes were characterized throughout the entire MCC population because of the high conservation of LMW-GS genes at this locus (Fig. 2c). Among them,D3-578awas linked with theD3-432allele, whereasD3-578bwas generally coupled withD3-441(Fig. 2c). TheD3-586gene showed high length polymorphisms among MCC accessions for six allelic variantsD3-583/586/589/591/594/597, which resulted in detection of 14 main genotypes at theGlu-D3locus in MCC accessions (Fig. 2c). Two genotypes,D3-385/D3-393/D3-394/D3-441/D3-525/D3-575/D3-578/D3-586andD3-385/D3-393/D3-394/D3-441/D3-525/D3-575/D3-578/D3-589, differed only in the pseudogeneD3-586, which accounted for 64.8% of the MCC accessions (Fig. 2c). Since only the active genes in this family affected bread-making quality, the mRNA of the developing seeds was investigated (Fig. 3) and active LMW-GS genes were identified by comparing the mRNA and genomic DNA data (Fig. 3). Expression analysis of LMW-GS genes in MCC accessions. Electropherograms show the patterns of DNA fragments detected in genomic DNA and cDNA of individual accessions using the LMWGS1 primers. The results of four of 45 representative accessions are shown. The horizontal axis shows the size of the detected DNA fragments, while the vertical axis displays the signal intensity (i.e. the concentration of DNA fragments in the PCR products). The orange peaks indicate the GeneScan 1200 LIZ size standard fragments, while the blue peaks represent the DNA fragments in the PCR products. In the genomic DNA electropherogram, peaks indicated by arrows and numbers were detected only in genomic DNA, all of which were pseudogenes. Peaks in the cDNA electropherograms indicated by numbers correspond to active LMW-GS genes. Glu-A3genes are shown in black,Glu-B3genes in green, andGlu-D3genes in pink. At theGlu-A3locus, among the 4-6 genes detected in genomic DNA (Fig. 2a), theA3-370a/bandA3-391alleles were not detected in mRNA of developing seeds (Fig. 3), while their allelic variantA3-373may have been active in the intact ORF. In terms of theA3-400gene, theA3-400andA3-402aalleles were inactive, whereas bothA3-402bandA3-408were expressed during seed filling (Fig. 3). Also, the rare allelic variantsA3-374,A3-388,A3-394a/b, andA3-411may encode LMW-GS proteins in their intact ORFs. None of the allelic variants of theA3-502gene was expressed due to premature stop codons, except for the active alleleA3-502h. Among the other i-type genes,A3-573,A3-620,A3-646,A3-649-2,A3-568, andA3-662were detected in developing seeds (Fig. 3), and the rare allelic variantsA3-626a/b,A3-643,A3-567-1,A3-567-2, andA3-590contained intact ORFs, which might also be active in common wheat. Thus, in a particular wheat variety, 1-3 LMW-GS genes might be active at theGlu-A3locus (Fig. 2a). For example, accessions with the genotypeA3-391/A3-400/A3-502/A3-620contained only one active LMW-GS gene,A3-620, while those with the i-type haplotypeA3-484/A3-565/A3-568/A3-662possessed three active genes at theGlu-A3locus (Fig. 2a). At theGlu-B3locus, 3-5 genes were detected in the genomic DNA of individual accessions (Fig. 2b). Based on the electropherogram of the LMW-GS gene marker system, theB3-548,B3-578a/b, andB3-813genes were not detected in developing seeds (Fig. 3), while the remaining m-type genes (B3-530and the newly identifiedB3-570) and s-type genes (B3-544,B3-621, andB3-688) were generally expressed in wheat varieties, althoughB3-570was only present in partial MCC accessions (Figs 2b,3). With regard to active genes of different haplotypes, the number of activeGlu-B3genes varied from two to four in one wheat variety, including one or two m-type-encoding genes and one or two s-type-encoding genes (Fig. 2b). At theGlu-D3locus, of the eight LMW-GS genes detected in genomic DNA,D3-385,D3-394,D3-441,D3-525,D3-575, andD3-578were detected in developing seeds of MCC accessions (Fig. 3), and the rare allelic variantsD3-397,D3-444, andD3-522might be active in their intact ORF. The remaining two genes,D3-393andD3-586, were not identified in the developing seeds probably due to premature stop codons (Fig. 3). Thus, one s-type (D3-578) and five m-type genes (D3-385,D3-394,D3-441,D3-525, andD3-575) were generally expressed at theGlu-D3locus in individual wheat varieties (Fig. 2c). These expression analyses revealed that individual accessions with different allelic variants or haplotypes might possess different numbers of active genes. Generally, none or one m-type and one or two i-type active genes were detected at theGlu-A3locus, and one or two m-type and one or two s-type genes at theGlu-B3locus were expressed, whereas one s-type and five m-type genes comprised the active genes at theGlu-D3locus. Thus, the number of active genes in individual MCC accessions varied from nine to 13. All proteins encoded by the genes identified in the present study were typical of LMW-GS, which had similar structures to previously characterized LMW-GS (D'Ovidio and Masci, 2004;Juhasz and Gianibelli, 2006). Each deduced protein contained four main structural domains: a signal peptide, a short conserved N-terminal domain, a repetitive domain, and a C-terminal domain, except for i-type proteins, which lacked the N-terminal domain (Supplementary Fig. S11atJXBonline). Based on the N-terminal sequence of mature proteins, three types of LMW-GS (m-, s-, and i-types) were recognized. The m-type proteins were the most abundant in all genotypes analysed, and their molecular mass varied from 31.8kDa (D3-385) to 39.6kDa (D3-575). The s-type proteins generally had a higher molecular mass than did m-type subunits, which ranged from 37.0kDa (B3-544) to 42.5kDa (B3-691). Also, the i-type proteins had higher molecular weights (39.2-43.0kDa), despite lacking the N-terminal sequences. Cysteine residues played a vital role in determining the structural and functional characteristics of wheat proteins (ShewryNone., 1995;D'Ovidio and Masci, 2004). All deduced proteins identified in this study possessed eight cysteine residues, except the putative amino acid sequences from pseudogenesA3-502dandD3-385', which contained seven and nine cysteine residues, respectively. However, both pseudogenes do not play a role in glutenin polymers and bread-making quality. The locations of the first (or third for i-type genes) and seventh cysteines were highly diverse, while the remaining six cysteines were conserved among all LMW-GS genes (Supplementary Fig. S11atJXBonline). Based on the relative locations of cysteines, LMW-GS proteins were divided into six groups (Supplementary Fig. S11). All LMW-GS genes and their allelic variants were subjected to cluster analysis using ClustalW2 and MEGA 5. Also, the six main groups were further divided, which was consistent with the grouping data based on the cysteine positions of the deduced proteins (Fig. 4). The i-type genes located at theGlu-A3locus formed a single group (iA), and all the s-type genes at theGlu-B3locus andGlu-D3locus were located in a single branch (sBD) (Fig. 4). All the remaining LMW-GS genes were m-type, which were further divided into four groups (Fig. 4). Variants of both theD3-441andD3-525genes formed single groups (mD-2 and mD-1, respectively), which were unique at theGlu-D3locus. The mBDgroup was composed of three genes (B3-530,B3-548, andB3-570) from theGlu-B3locus and two (D3-575andD3-586) from theGlu-D3locus. In contrast, the mADgroup contained five m-type genes, two of which were located at theGlu-A3locus and three at theGlu-D3locus. Collectively, genes from theGlu-A3locus contained all the i-type genes (iA) and m-type genes (mAD), genes from theGlu-B3locus were associated with two groups, including s-type (sBD) and m-type (mBD) genes, and genes from theGlu-D3locus were distributed into five of the six groups and showed higher diversity than those at theGlu-A3andGlu-B3loci (Fig. 4). Phylogenetic reconstruction of all LMW-GS genes and their allelic variants identified from MCC accessions. The phylogenetic tree of LMW-GS genes was constructed using MEGA 5 (KumarNone. 2008). All LMW-GS genes were divided into six groups. The i-type genes located atGlu-A3were special and formed a single group (iA). The s-type genes atGlu-B3andGlu-D3shared high identity and were located in a single branch (sBD). The other LMW-GS genes were of the m-type, and were divided into four groups (mAD, mD-1, mBD, and mD-2). LMW-GS genes at theGlu-D3locus were assigned to five groups, and showed a higher diversity than those at theGlu-A3andGlu-B3loci. (This figure is available in colour atJXBonline.) Of the LMW-GS genes, i-type genes were the most complex and 12 haplotypes were detected, each of which contained unique LMW-GS genes. Sequence alignments and phylogenetic analysis of all i-type genes demonstrated that theA3-502gene was conserved ( greater than 85% diversity) among the haplotypes, whereas the other genes could be divided into five subgroups (Supplementary Fig. S12atJXBonline). A3-626andA3-643shared high identity ( greater than 98%) and formed the subgroup iA-1 with theA3-502gene. The haplotypesA3-502e/fandA3-646were named iA-2. TheA3-502g/A3-573/A3-640andA3-502h/A3-649-1/A3-649-2haplotypes contained three i-type genes and were classified into subgroups iA-3 and iA-4, respectively. A3-484/A3-565/A3-568/A3-662andA3-487/A3-567-1/A3-567-2/A3-590represented a unique i-type genotype (iA-5) in common wheat (Supplementary Fig. S12). LMW-GS genes in common wheat are complex, and their exact copy number remains unclear (CassidyNone., 1998;IkedaNone., 2002;Juhasz and Gianibelli, 2006;Huang and Cloutier, 2008;DongNone., 2010). Recently, using BAC library screening, 14 and 19 genes were isolated from the common wheat varieties Xiaoyan 54 and Glenlea, respectively (Huang and Cloutier, 2008;DongNone., 2010). Meanwhile, LMW-GS genes at theGlu-A3,Glu-B3, andGlu-D3loci were identified using gene-specific primers, which suggested that at least 12 genes are present in the common wheat genome (ZhaoNone., 2006,2007;WangNone., 2009,2010). Based on the conserved and polymorphic structures of these genes, the LMW-GS gene marker system and the full-length gene cloning method were developed, which can identify greater than 15 members of this gene family in common wheat (ZhangNone., 2011None,None). In the present study, both methods were used to investigate the MCC of Chinese wheat germplasm, and the complex LMW-GS gene family in common wheat was successfully dissected. Two m-type genes and 2-4 i-type LMW-GS genes were generally identified at theGlu-A3locus, which was the highest number reported for this locus in individual wheat varieties (Figs 1a,2a). The m-type gene,A3-391, and its allelic variants shared high identities ( greater than 99%) with a few sequences in GenBank derived fromT. macha,T. durum, andT. timopheevii(Supplementary Table S2atJXBonline), which suggests thatA3-391might be widely present inTriticum. The other m-type gene at theGlu-A3locus,A3-400, was reported by several groups, corresponding toGluA3-2genes from Aroona near-isogenic lines (NILs) (WangNone., 2010), the group 6 type IV gene from Norin 61 (IkedaNone., 2002), andA3-1from Xiaoyan 54 (Supplementary Table S2) (DongNone., 2010). The present results provided direct evidence for the presence of m-type genes at theGlu-A3locus in common wheat, and this gene showed high diversity among MCC accessions with several novel allelic variants (i.e. A3-374,A3-388,A3-394a, andA3-411;Fig. 1a). Moreover, the new allelic variants,A3-388,A3-394a/b,A3-408, andA3-411, contained intact ORFs and may make specific contributions to wheat bread-making quality. In the present study, using conserved primers, 2-4 i-type genes were identified in individual wheat varieties. (Supplementary Table S2atJXBonline). In previous studies, 1-3 i-type genes in only a few wheat varieties were characterized (Supplementary Table S2) (ZhangNone., 2004;IkedaNone., 2006;Huang and Cloutier, 2008;DongNone., 2010), which made it difficult to analyse the relationships among haplotypes of these genes. Here, the MCC of Chinese wheat germplasm were investigated in terms of LMW-GS gene composition. The i-type genes were present in the wheat genome as haplotypes rather than single genes, and 12 haplotypes of i-type genes were detected in the MCC. Nucleotide sequence comparisons showed that genes in six of 12 haplotypes identified in this study were similar ( greater than 99%) to those isolated from sevenGlu-A3alleles, for example haplotypeA3-502d/643corresponding toGluA3-32/Glu-A3-12fromGlu-A3b(Supplementary Table S2) (WangNone., 2010;ZhangNone., 2012). In addition, haplotypeA3-484/A3-565/A3-568/A3-662contained the three i-type genes identified in Norin 61 and Xiaoyan 54 (A3-2,A3-3, andA3-4), and the haplotypeA3-502f/646bcovered the i-type gene detected in Glenlea (EU189087) (Huang and Cloutier, 2008;DongNone., 2010). This confirms that i-type genes in common wheat exist as haplotypes at theGlu-A3locus and exhibit high genetic diversity. The identification and characterization of these haplotypes will facilitate the functional analysis of i-type genes and the selection of specific genes using haplotype-specific markers. Three to fiveGlu-B3genes were detected in individual varieties, of which 1-3 were s-type and two or three were m-type (Figs 1b,2b). The m-type geneB3-530shared greater than 99% sequence identity withGluB3-4genes from Aroona and its near-isogenic lines, theB3-1gene from Xiaoyan 54 and Jing 411,1557N24-Mfrom Glenlea, and the group 2 type I gene from Norin 61 (Supplementary Table S2atJXBonline) (IkedaNone., 2002;Huang and Cloutier, 2008;WangNone., 2009;DongNone., 2010), whileB3-548has been reported only rarely since it is a pseudogene. The third m-type gene,B3-570, was newly identified from wheat varieties and was detected in partial MCC accessions containingB3-510(Fig. 2b). Thus, at least two m-type genes were present at theGlu-B3locus, rather than the one reported previously (IkedaNone., 2002;Huang and Cloutier, 2008;DongNone., 2010). The other genes at theGlu-B3locus were of s-type, and were divided into two subgroups based on their gene composition; one containing theB3-688gene and the other containingB3-621(Figs 1b,2b). TheB3-688subgroup of s-type haplotypes corresponded toB3-2from Xiaoyan 54 as well as Jing 411 andGluB3-3from Aroona-Glu-B3c,B3d,B3h, andB3i(Supplementary Table S2) (WangNone., 2009;DongNone., 2010;ZhangNone., 2012). The other subgroup contained two active genes,B3-544andB3-621, and one pseudogene,B3-578. B3-544had 99% sequence identity withGluB3-1from Aroona-Glu-B3a,B3b,B3f, andB3g. Also,B3-621genes were present in Aroona-Glu-B3a,B3b,B3f, andB3g, corresponding toGluB3-2(WangNone., 2009;ZhangNone., 2012) (Supplementary Table S2). Thus, s-type genes existed as haplotypes in common wheat. However, both subgroups of s-type genes displayed significant differences in terms of gene composition and sequences, and thus might make different contributions to dough quality. Overall, evaluation ofGlu-B3genes/haplotypes will enable development of haplotype-specific primers for marker-assisted selection. One s-type and seven m-type genes were identified at theGlu-D3locus from a single wheat genotype, which was by far the highest number of LMW-GS genes reported for this locus (Fig. 2c). PseudogeneD3-586was newly detected in common wheat, whereas the other seven genes have been investigated extensively (Supplementary Table S2atJXBonline), and covered allGlu-D3genes identified in wheat varieties, including Norin 61, Glenlea, Xiaoyan 54, Jing 411, and Aroona NILs (Supplementary Table S2) (IkedaNone., 2002;ZhaoNone., 2006,2007;Huang and Cloutier, 2008;DongNone., 2010;ZhangNone., 2011None,None). TheseGlu-D3genes were highly conserved, with only a few allelic variants ( greater than 99% identities), of which three novel active allelic variants (D3-397,D3-444, andD3-522) were detected with unique SNPs or indels in MCC, but functional analysis of these variants has been limited. Moreover, theseGlu-D3genes shared greater than 97% identities with LMW-GS genes isolated fromAegilops tauschii(JohalNone., 2004;DongNone., 2010), which further confirmed the conservation ofGlu-D3genes. Typical LMW-GS genes were located at theGlu-A3,Glu-B3, andGlu-D3loci on the homoeologous group 1 chromosomes. However, little is known about the relative location of LMW-GS genes at individual loci due to the complexity of gene composition and the lack of appropriate methods of investigating this gene family. Recently, the recombination of 14 LMW-GS genes atGlu-3loci was analysed and the relative genetic position of these genes was determined (DongNone., 2010). Subsequently, four more genes were detected and sequenced in Xiaoyan 54 (ZhangNone., 2011None,None). In the present study, based on the allelic relationship with the genes in Xiaoyan 54, all the LMW-GS genes in the MCC were located at a specific position in homoeologous group 1 chromosomes (Fig. 5). At theGlu-A3locus, two groups of LMW-GS genes, mADand iAgene clusters, were found and little recombination was detected within groups, of which the iAgroup was distal and the mADgroup was proximal to the centromere (Figs 2,5). At theGlu-B3locus, although the relative position ofA3-548was not determined, the m- and s-type genes might exist as two gene clusters (mBDand sBD). Also, m-type genes were more proximal to the centromere than s-type genes (Figs 2,5). At theGlu-D3locus, tight linkage was identified only betweenD3-441andD3-578aorD3-432andD3-578b(Fig. 5), which could be explained by the close physical proximity (15.9kb) of these genes (DongNone., 2010). Additionally,D3-385,D3-393,D3-394, andD3-525genes were located in close proximity and had a high identity (Figs 4,5). Based on the location and sequence analysis, LMW-GS genes that show high identity or belong to the same group may be tightly linked and located at the same position in theGlu-3loci. Organization of the LMW-GS genes in homoeologous group 1 chromosomes. The relative locations of genes or haplotypes were determined based onDongNone. (2010). The main allelic variants are displayed as representatives. The distances among genes do not represent the genetic or physical distances. (A) Relative genetic positions of LMW-GS genes at theGlu-A3locus. The i-type genes were tightly linked at theGlu-A3locus and formed five haplotype subgroups, and both m-type genes also generally co-segregated in the MCC. (B) Relative genetic positions of LMW-GS genes at theGlu-B3locus. The s-type genes were coupled at theGlu-B3locus and were of two principal haplotypes. (C) Relative genetic positions of the eight LMW-GS genes at theGlu-D3locus. Of these, onlyD3-411andD3-578were tightly linked. In addition, twelve i-type haplotypes at theGlu-A3locus could be divided into five subgroups (iA-1 to iA-5;Fig. 5;Supplementary Fig. S12atJXBonline), and s-type haplotypes at theGlu-B3locus were divided into two subgroups, revealing the high diversity of the i- and s-type genes/haplotypes among wheat varieties. These subgroups were significantly different in terms of gene numbers and sequences, which suggests that theGlu-A3andGlu-B3loci in common wheat might be derived from several unique ancestors or have been involved in significant mutational or recombination events during the course of their evolution (Figs 1b,5). The LMW-GS gene family was investigated using the MCC of Chinese wheat germplasm, which consists of 262 accessions with an estimated 70% genetic diversity compared with the full collection (HaoNone., 2011). Using the MCC, most ( greater than 15) LMW-GS genes were identified in individual wheat varieties. This allowed investigation of the classification and relationship of these genes in Chinese wheat germplasm. The i-type genes were reported only at theGlu-A3locus (ZhangNone., 2004;IkedaNone., 2006;Huang and Cloutier, 2008;DongNone., 2010;WangNone., 2010;ZhangNone., 2011None,None) or the A genome, for exampleT. urartuandT. monococcum(AnNone., 2006;MaNone., 2006;CaballeroNone., 2008;LongNone., 2008). The findings also indicate that all i-type genes detected in MCC accessions were located at theGlu-A3locus (Fig. 4). Since i-type genes lacked the sequences encoding the N-terminal domain, m- and s-type genes without the N-terminal domain-coding sequences were used for the phylogenetic analysis. It was found that i-type genes had a closer relationship with s-type genes (sBD) than m-type genes, excluding the mD-2 group (Supplementary Fig. S13atJXBonline). This results confirmed that the i-type genes may be the result of a deletion event of s-type genes (GaoNone., 2007), and the i-type genes comprised a relatively young group of LMW-GS genes (Juhasz and Gianibelli, 2006). The s-type genes were distributed at theGlu-B3andGlu-D3loci in common wheat and the progenitor of the wheat A genome,T. urartu(data not shown), but not at theGlu-A3locus in common wheat (Fig. 4). This suggests that their disappearance from theGlu-A3locus might be the result of elimination at the polyploid level. The m-type genes were common at theGlu-3loci, and the difference between the s- and m-types was not significant (D'Ovidio and Masci, 2004). TheD3-441gene (mD-2) and s-type genes were located at the same main branch, although they belonged to different groups (Fig. 4). These data confirm that the s-type genes probably originated from m-type genes due to mutation of MET to MEN in the N-terminal region (MasciNone., 1998;D'Ovidio and Masci, 2004). This also suggests that the m-type genes might be the oldest type of LMW-GS gene. Genome sequence analysis ofGlu-3loci revealed that both i-type and s-type genes/haplotypes existed together with thePm3analogue and genetic markerSFR159, while most m-type genes, mAD, mD-1, and mBD, were tightly linked with another genetic marker,WHS179(WickerNone., 2003;GaoNone., 2007;DongNone., 2010). Moreover, at theGlu-A3andB3loci, i-type and s-type genes were distal, while the mADand mBDgroups of genes were proximal to the centromere (Fig. 5) (DongNone., 2010). At theGlu-D3locus, the s-type geneD3-578was also more distal to the centromere than the mBDgene,D3-575(Fig. 5) (DongNone., 2010). Thus, the phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 4;Supplementary Fig. S13atJXBonline), together with the linked genes/markers and their relative locations on chromosomes, suggest that i-type and s-type genes may have been derived from similar ancestral genes, and the mAD(onlyGlu-A3genes) and mBDgroups of genes were orthologues among the A, B, and D subgenomes. After sequence alignment and clustering analysis, the LMW-GS genes detected in MCC accessions were divided into six groups (Fig. 4). The genes at theGlu-A3locus were assigned to the iAand mADgroups, and those at theGlu-B3locus were divided into the sBDand mBDgroups, whereas those at theGlu-D3locus were distributed widely among the mD-1, mD-2, sBD, mBD, and mADgroups (Fig. 4). Thus, theGlu-D3genes showed higher diversity than those at theGlu-A3orGlu-B3loci in individual wheat varieties. TheGlu-A3locus did not share the same group of LMW-GS genes as theGlu-B3locus (Figs 4,5), which suggested that genes at theGlu-A3andGlu-B3loci evolved through different routes and had a distant evolutionary relationship. All genes at theGlu-B3locus and threeGlu-D3genes comprised two groups (sBDand mBD); these homoeoalleles showed close relationships between theGlu-B3andGlu-D3loci, which were consistent with the derivation of BB and DD subgenomes fromAegilops. Analysis of the LMW-GS gene family was performed using MCC accessions, consisting of foreign varieties, Chinese modern varieties, and landraces. The novel i-type haplotype,A3-502h/A3-649-1/A3-649-2was detected only in landraces and were absent from Chinese modern or foreign wheat varieties (Fig. 2a). This also occurred for genotypes containingB3-624and the genotypeB3-530/B3-548/B3-688/B3-691(Fig. 2b). Although these haplotypes possessed an equal number of active genes to other haplotypes, they have not been selected for use in modern wheat breeding programmes. This may be because these genes or those linked to them have a detrimental effect on bread-making quality or yield potential. In contrast,A3-394a/b,B3-601/604, and the genotypesD3-385/D3-376/-/D3-432/-/D3-575/D3-578a/-, and 1BL/1RS lines were present only in modern or foreign varieties. The presence of these genes/genotypes in Chinese modern varieties might be the result of incorporation of foreign germplasm in breeding programmes in the past several decades. For example, the elite 1BL/1RS translocation lines were introduced into China in the 1970s and were exploited in modern wheat breeding since they contain several disease resistance and yield improvement genes. Also, the other genes/genotypes were probably introduced into Chinese wheat germplasm since they (or linked genes) increased the yield potential or bread-making quality. Using the LMW-GS gene marker system and full-length gene cloning method, a representative population (MCC) was investigated, and the composition, organization, variation, and expression of LMW-GS genes were evaluated. Furthermore, the LMW-GS genes corresponding to all DNA fragments from the LMW-GS gene marker system were identified (Table 1;Supplementary S1atJXBonline). The expression profile of these genes was revealed by comparing the genomic DNA and cDNA data. These data will facilitate the update of the LMW-GS gene marker system which can be used to separate, identify, and characterize LMW-GS genes efficiently in common wheat.
