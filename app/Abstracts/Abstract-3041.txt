Human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) infections are intra-epithelial, and thus, HPV16 is known to interact with Langerhans cells (LCs), the resident epithelial antigen-presenting cells (APCs). The current paradigm for APC-mediated induction of T cell anergy is through delivery of T cell receptor signals via peptides on MHC molecules (signal 1), but without costimulation (signal 2). We previously demonstrated that LCs exposed to HPV16
