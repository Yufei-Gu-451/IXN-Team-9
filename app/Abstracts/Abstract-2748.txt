As a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) agonist, fenofibrate favorably modulates dyslipidemia and inflammation markers, which are associated with cardiovascular risk. To determine whether variation in the PPARalpha receptor gene was associated with lipid and inflammatory marker response, we conducted a three week trial of fenofibrate in 861 men and women. Mixed linear models which controlled for age and sex, as well as family pedigree and study-center, were constructed using SNPs in the PPARalpha gene as predictors and changes in fasting triglycerides (TGs), cholesterol and inflammatory markers as outcomes. Significant associations with low-density cholesterol (LDL-C) and interleukin-2 (IL-2;
