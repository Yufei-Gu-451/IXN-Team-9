This study explores and characterizes the toxicity of two closely related carcinogenic dinitro-pyrenes (DNPs), 1,3-DNP and 1,8-DNP, in human bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells and mouse hepatoma Hepa1c1c7 cells. Neither 1,3-DNP nor 1,8-DNP (3-30 muM) induced cell death in BEAS-2B cells. In Hepa1c1c7 cells only 1,3-DNP (10-30 muM) induced a mixture of apoptotic and necrotic cell death after 24 h. Both compounds increased the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in BEAS-2B as measured by CM-H
