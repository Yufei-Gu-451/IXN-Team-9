In diabetes, low concentrations of the biomarker 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) reflect hyperglycemic excursions over the prior 1-2 weeks. To the extent that hyperglycemic excursions are important in atherogenesis, 1,5-AG may provide independent information regarding cardiovascular risk. Nonetheless, few studies have evaluated associations of 1,5-AG with long-term cardiovascular outcomes in a population-based setting. We measured 1,5-AG in 11,106 participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study without cardiovascular disease at baseline (1990-1992) and examined prospective associations with coronary heart disease (
