Oligomers that contain both alpha- and beta-amino acid residues, or "alpha/beta-peptides", have emerged as promising mimics of signal-bearing polypeptides that can inhibit or augment natural protein-protein interactions. alpha/beta-Peptides that contain a sufficient proportion of beta residues evenly distributed along the sequence can be highly resistant to enzymatic degradation, which is favorable with regard to
