Sarcomas of the prostate are rare tumours. Their clinicopathologic features are well described, however, the imaging features of these tumours have rarely been documented. The purpose of this article is to illustrate the imaging findings of prostate sarcomas, with an emphasis on their appearance on magnetic resonance imaging and to identify features that may help to differentiate them from the commoner prostate adenocarcinomas.
