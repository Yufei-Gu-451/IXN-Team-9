This paper describes a synthetic approach for photocrosslinkable polyfluorene (pc-PFO) semiconducting polymer dots, and demonstrates their superior ability to crosslink and form 3-D intermolecular polymer networks. The crosslinked pc-PFO Pdots are equipped with excellent encapsulating ability of functional small molecules. Optimum conditions of light irradiation on pc-PFO Pdots were investigated and clarified by using polymer thin films as a model. By employing the optimal light irradiation conditions, we successfully crosslinked pc-PFO Pdots and studied their particle sizes, photophysical, and colloidal properties. Single-particle imaging and dynamic-light-scattering measurements were conducted to understand the behaviors of photocrosslinked Pdots. Our results indicate pc-PFO Pdots can be easily photocrosslinked and the crosslinked species have excellent colloidal stability, physical and chemical stability, fluorescence brightness, and specific binding properties for cellular labeling. Considering that optical stimulus can work remotely, cleanly, and non-invasively, this study should pave the way for a promising approach to further develop stimuli-responsive ultrabright and versatile Pdot probes for biomedical imaging.
