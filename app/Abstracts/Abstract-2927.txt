To evaluate long-term urinary, sexual and bowel functional outcomes after prostate cancer treatment at a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 12 (11-13) years. In this nationwide, population-based study, we identified 6 003 men diagnosed with localized prostate cancer (clinical local stageResponses were obtained from 3 937/6 003 cases (66%) and 459/1 000 (46%) controls. At 12 years after diagnosis and at a median age of 75 years, the proportion of cases with adverse symptoms was 87% for erectile dysfunction/sexual inactivity, 20% for urinary incontinence and 14% for bowel disturbances. The corresponding proportions for controls were 62, 6 and 7%, respectively. Men with prostate cancer, except those on surveillance, had an increased risk of erectile dysfunction compared with the men in the control group. Radical prostatectomy was associated with an increased risk of urinary incontinence (odds ratio [OR] 1.89, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.36-2.62) and radiotherapy increased the risk of bowel dysfunction (The proportion of men who experienced a long-term impact on functional outcomes after prostate cancer treatment was substantial.
