Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) promotes glucose-dependent insulin secretion. However, GIP also enhances glucocorticoid secretion and promotes adiposity. Because obesity and diabetes are glucocorticoid dependent, we examined whether the effects of GIP on energy balance and glycemia are regulated by glucocorticoids using pharmacological activation of GIP receptor (GIPR) signaling with [
