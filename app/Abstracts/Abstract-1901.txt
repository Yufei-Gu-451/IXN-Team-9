Glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78) functions as a sensor of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that molecules that bind to GRP78 induce the unfolded protein response (UPR) and enhance cell death in combination with ER stress inducers. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), measurement of cell death by flow cytometry and the induction of ER stress markers using western blotting. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a flavonoid component of Green TeaHonokiol induces apoptosis due to ER stress from an interaction with GRP78. The data are consistent with DSC results that suggest that HNK binds to GRP78 more effectively than EGCG. Therefore, HNK may warrant development as an antitumour drug.
