To examine whether and how parents' and adolescent siblings' weight and weight-related behaviors are correlated. Results will inform which family members may be important to include in adolescent obesity prevention interventions. Data from two linked population-based studies, EAT 2010 and F-EAT, were used for cross-sectional analyses. Parents (n=58; 91% females; mean age=41.7 years) and adolescent siblings (sibling #1 n=58, 50% girls, mean age=14.3 years; sibling #2 n=58, 64% Girls, mean age=14.8) were socioeconomically and racially/ethnically diverse. Some weight-related behaviors between adolescent siblings were significantly positively correlated (i.e., fast food consumption, breakfast frequency, sedentary patterns, p less than 0.05). There were no significant correlations between parent weight and weight-related behaviors and adolescent siblings' same behaviors. Some of the significant correlations found between adolescent siblings' weight-related behaviors were statistically different from correlations between parents' and adolescent siblings' weight-related behaviors. Although not consistently, adolescent siblings' weight-related behaviors were significantly correlated as compared to parents' and adolescent siblings' weight-related behaviors. It may be important to consider including siblings in adolescent obesity prevention interventions or in recommendations healthcare providers give to adolescents regarding their weight and weight-related behaviors.
