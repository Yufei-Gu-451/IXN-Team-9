The effects of longitudinal changes in the visceral fat area (VFA), and other anthropometric indices, on the risk factors of metabolic syndrome were not studied. We calculated the changes in metabolic risk factors in relation to changes in certain anthropometric indices in a large-scale study of Japanese men. The subjects were 1,106 men participating in the Hitachi Health Study who received a computed tomography examination in both 2004 and 2007. VFA, subcutaneous fat area (SFA), and waist circumference were measured using the computed tomography. We examined how longitudinal changes in each anthropometric index over a 3-year period influenced the value of each metabolic risk factor. Changes (?) over a 3-year period in body weight, SFA, and waist circumference strongly correlated, while the changes in body weight and VFA were weakly correlated. Changes in the VFA were associated with changes in metabolic risk factors, especially changes in triglyceride and HDL; we found these changes to be independent of the ?body weight and ?waist circumference. Change in body weight is not a precise surrogate marker of ?VFA, and repeated VFA measurements over time are useful. Adopting a lifestyle that does not increase the VFA is important in preventing metabolic syndrome.
