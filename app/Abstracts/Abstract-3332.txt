To examine whether there were long-term (between 1988-1994 and 2001-2008) and recent (between 2001-2004 and 2005-2008) changes in blood pressure (BP) levels among U.S. adults with diagnosed diabetes. Using data from National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES), we examined changes in BP distributions, mean BPs, and proportion with BP less than 140/90 mmHg. Between 1988-1994 and 2001-2008, for adults with diabetes, mean BPs decreased from 135/72 mmHg to 131/69 mmHg (BP levels among adults with diabetes improved between 1988-1994 and 2001-2008, but the progress stalled between 2001-2004 and 2005-2008. The lack of improvement among young adults is concerning.
