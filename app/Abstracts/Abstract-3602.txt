We tested genetic associations with weight loss and weight regain in the Diabetes Prevention Program, a randomized controlled trial of weight loss-inducing interventions (lifestyle and metformin) versus placebo. Sixteen obesity-predisposing single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were tested for association with short-term (baseline to 6 months) and long-term (baseline to 2 years) weight loss and weight regain (6 months to study end). Irrespective of treatment, the Ala12 allele atGenetic information may help identify people who require additional support to maintain reduced weight after clinical intervention.
