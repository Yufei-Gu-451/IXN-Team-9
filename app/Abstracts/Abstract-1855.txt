Greatwall kinase relocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm is required at mitotic entry and is mediated by a phosphorylation-dependent mechanism targeting its central region. Cell division requires the coordination of critical protein kinases and phosphatases. Greatwall (Gwl) kinase activity inactivates PP2A-B55 at mitotic entry to promote the phosphorylation of cyclin B-Cdk1 substrates, but how Gwl is regulated is poorly understood. We found that the subcellular localization of Gwl changed dramatically during the cell cycle in
