A number of amyloidogenic variants of apoA-I have been discovered but most have not been analyzed. Previously, we showed that the G26R mutation of apoA-I leads to increased beta-strand structure, increased N-terminal protease susceptibility, and increased fibril formation after several days of incubation. In vivo, this and other variants mutated in the N-terminal domain (residues 26 to ?90) lead to renal and hepatic accumulation. In contrast, several mutations identified within residues 170 to 178 lead to cardiac, laryngeal, and cutaneous protein deposition. Here, we describe the structural changes in the fibrillogenic variant L178H. Like G26R, the initial structure of the protein exhibits altered tertiary conformation relative to wild-type protein along with decreased stability and an altered lipid binding profile. However, in contrast to G26R, L178H undergoes an increase in helical structure upon incubation at 37 degrees C with a half time (t
