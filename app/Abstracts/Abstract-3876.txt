The effects of Therapeutic Lifestyle Change (TLC) diets, low and high in dietary fish, on apolipoprotein metabolism were examined. Subjects were provided with a Western diet for 6 weeks, followed by 24 weeks of either of two TLC diets (10/group). Apolipoprotein kinetics were determined in the fed state using stable isotope methods and compartmental modeling at the end of each phase. Only the high-fish diet decreased median triglyceride-rich lipoprotein (TRL) apoB-100 concentration (-23%), production rate (PR, -9%), and direct catabolism (-53%), and increased TRL-to-LDL apoB-100 conversion (+39%) as compared with the baseline diet (all
