Diabetes is associated with loss of functional pancreatic beta-cells, and restoration of beta-cells is a major goal for regenerative therapies. Endogenous regeneration of beta-cells via beta-cell replication has the potential to restore cellular mass; however, pharmacological agents that promote regeneration or expansion of endogenous beta-cells have been elusive. The regenerative capacity of beta-cells declines rapidly with age, due to accumulation of p16
