Best-practice diabetes care can reduce the burden of diabetes and associated health care costs. But this requires access to a multidisciplinary team with the right skill mix. We applied a needs-driven evidence-based health workforce model to describe the primary care team required to support best-practice diabetes care, paying particular attention to diverse clinic populations. Care protocols, by number and duration of consultations, were derived for twenty distinct competencies based on clinical practice guidelines and structured input from a multidisciplinary clinical panel. This was combined with a previously estimated population profile of persons across 26 patient attributes (i.e., type of diabetes, complications, and threats to self-care) to estimate clinician contact hours by competency required to deliver best-practice care in the study region. A primary care team of 22.1 full-time-equivalent (FTE) positions was needed to deliver best-practice primary care to a catchment of 1,000 persons with diabetes with the attributes of the Australian population. Competencies requiring greatest contact time were psychosocial issues and dietary advice at 3.5 and 3.3 FTE, respectively (1 FTE/?300 persons); home (district) nursing at 3.2 FTE; and diabetes education at 2.8 FTE. The annual cost of delivering care was estimated at just over 2,000 Australian dollars (?2,090 USD) (2012) per person with diabetes. A needs-driven approach to primary care service planning identified a wider range of competencies in the diabetes primary and community care team than typically described. Access to psychosocial competences as well as medical management is required if clinical targets are to be met, especially in disadvantaged groups.
