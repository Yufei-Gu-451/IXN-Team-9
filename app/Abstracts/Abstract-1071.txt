Type 1 diabetes (T1D) results from immune-mediated destruction of insulin-producing beta-cells. The killing of beta-cells is not currently measurable; beta-cell functional studies routinely used are affected by environmental factors such as glucose and cannot distinguish death from dysfunction. Moreover, it is not known whether immune therapies affect killing. We developed an assay to identify beta-cell death by measuring relative levels of unmethylated
