High triglyceride (TG) levels and low HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) levels are risk factors for cardiovascular disease. It is unclear whether this relationship depends on glycemic dysregulation, sex, or LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) level. Participants with high TG and low HDL levels had a 1.32-fold greater HR (95% CI 1.06-1.64) for CHD than those with normal TG and normal HDL levels. It was observed in participants with diabetes, but not in those without diabetes, that high TG plus low HDL levels were associated with a 1.54-fold greater HR (95% CI 1.15-2.06) for CHD (Adults with both high TG and low HDL-C, particularly those with diabetes, have increased risks of incident CHD and stroke. In particular, those with an LDL-C level greater than =130 mg/dL may have an increased risk of incident stroke.
