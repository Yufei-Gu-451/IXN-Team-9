The germline mutations ofTP53gene increase the risk of various cancers (McBrideNone, 2014). The germline mutations of components of p53 signalling system (e.g.,ATM) also modulate cancer risk (Shiloh, 2003). The kinase coded byATMparticipates directly in activation of p53 by phosphorylating its serine 15 (BaninNone, 1998;CanmanNone, 1998). They found similar truncating mutation in another cell line (HCT116) used in studies of p53. Moreover, truncating mutations ofPPM1Dwere revealed in blood DNA from colorectal cancer patients. The mutant DNA sequences constituted only small fraction of DNA samples. We decided to find out whether truncating mutations ofPPM1Dare present in blood DNA samples from lung cancer patients. The mutations were confirmed by resequencing of independent PCR product. The p53-responsive promoters ofBAXandMDM2genes were cloned into pGL3-Basic reporter vector coding for firefly luciferase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The clones containing the codon 469 nucleotide substitution were identified. The beginning ofWIP1exon 6 containsBamHI site. The NCI-H1299 cells were transfected with FuGene6 (Promega), whereas SAOS-2 cells were transfected with Fugene HD (Active Motif, La Hulpe, Belgium) according to manufacturer's protocol. In negative control, the p53 and WIP1 plasmids were replaced by empty pcDNA3.1+ so the amount of DNA in transfection mixtures was kept constant (0,6 mug). The coding region of exon 6 ofPPM1Dwas sequenced in DNA samples isolated from blood of 543 NSCLC patients. In three cases, the mutation constituted a relatively large part of DNA sample. 522 has mosaic mutation ofPPM1Dand that the mutant cells constitute a large proportion of peripheral white blood cell population. This is consistent with the observations that the truncated WIP1 codes for gain-of-function mutants (KleiblovaNone, 2013;RuarkNone, 2013). We selected promoters fromBAXandMDM2genes, which in our experimental system, are activated 15- and 200-fold, respectively, by p53 expressed from the co-transfected vector in NCI-H1299 cells (Figure 5). This is the first report onPPM1Dmutations in blood DNA of NSCLC patients. Our observations apparently contrasts with the data published by others (KleiblovaNone2013) who showed that knockdown of WIP1 (either its mutant or wild-type form) promotes the expression of p21-the product of p53 target gene. WIP1 can dephosphorylate other proteins, including components of the base excision repair, what is associated with decreased activity of this DNA repair system (LuNone, 2004).
