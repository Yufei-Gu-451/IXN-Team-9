The germline mutations ofTP53gene increase the risk of various cancers (McBrideNone, 2014). In U-2 OS cells, we detected a nonsense mutation in codon 458 ofPPM1D(Arg458X). They found similar truncating mutation in another cell line (HCT116) used in studies of p53. Moreover, truncating mutations ofPPM1Dwere revealed in blood DNA from colorectal cancer patients. However, a paper published earlier demonstrated that the truncating mutations ofPPM1Dfound in blood cells of breast or ovarian cancer patients may result from sequence alterations formed during individual development as a mosaic mutations. The mutant DNA sequences constituted only small fraction of DNA samples. We decided to find out whether truncating mutations ofPPM1Dare present in blood DNA samples from lung cancer patients. The mutations were confirmed by resequencing of independent PCR product. The DNA fragment containing exon 6 with the substitution in codon 469 (AAA greater than GAA) was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA of the heterozygous individual using primers: WIP-P11 (see above) and WIP-CLO2. The NCI-H1299 cells were transfected with FuGene6 (Promega), whereas SAOS-2 cells were transfected with Fugene HD (Active Motif, La Hulpe, Belgium) according to manufacturer's protocol. Some transfected SAOS-2 cells were treated with 1 muM camptothecin (Calbiochem-Merck, Darmstadt, Germany, the stock solution 4 mM in DMSO), a topoisomerase I inhibitor strongly activating p53 (JaksNone, 2001). In three cases, the mutation constituted a relatively large part of DNA sample. 522 has mosaic mutation ofPPM1Dand that the mutant cells constitute a large proportion of peripheral white blood cell population. Table 2describes the clinical characteristics of five patients with mutation. All patients with mutations underwent chemotherapy before the blood draw (Table 2). The frequency of truncating mutations found in our group of cancer patients (5/543) is higher than the frequency found in the blood of non-cancer controls by other researchers (1/5861 inRuarkNone, 2013and 0/450 inKleiblovaNone, 2013). In our experiment, the expression of any form of WIP1 lowered the level of p53 with phosphorylated serine 15 without changing the total amount of p53 (Figure 3). This is consistent with the observations that the truncated WIP1 codes for gain-of-function mutants (KleiblovaNone, 2013;RuarkNone, 2013). We selected promoters fromBAXandMDM2genes, which in our experimental system, are activated 15- and 200-fold, respectively, by p53 expressed from the co-transfected vector in NCI-H1299 cells (Figure 5). Moreover, we conclude that WIP1 protein with Lys469Glu substitution does not significantly differ from wild type in our experiments. WIP1 can dephosphorylate other proteins, including components of the base excision repair, what is associated with decreased activity of this DNA repair system (LuNone, 2004).
