The germline mutations ofTP53gene increase the risk of various cancers (McBrideNone, 2014). The germline mutations of components of p53 signalling system (e.g.,ATM) also modulate cancer risk (Shiloh, 2003). This phosphate can be removed by a phosphatase coded byPPM1D(WIP1) gene (LuNone, 2005). In U-2 OS cells, we detected a nonsense mutation in codon 458 ofPPM1D(Arg458X). Initially, the functional significance of this mutation was unknown (ZajkowiczNone, 2013). They found similar truncating mutation in another cell line (HCT116) used in studies of p53. Moreover, truncating mutations ofPPM1Dwere revealed in blood DNA from colorectal cancer patients. The presence of mutantPPM1Din normal cells of cancer patients suggests that the mutations were transmitted in germline and contributed to carcinogenesis. Similar mutations ofPPM1Dwere also found by others in leukocytes of ovarian cancer patients (AkbariNone, 2014). We decided to find out whether truncating mutations ofPPM1Dare present in blood DNA samples from lung cancer patients. The exon 6 ofPPM1Dgene was amplified by PCR with AmpliTaq Gold polymerase (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and the following primers: WIP-P11 TAGTGAATGCATACCCCGTT (forward), WIP-P12 CAAGCAAGTACAAGGCCAGGA (reverse). Subsequently, the cloned PCR products were cut out from the pJET1.2/blunt vector withHinDIII andXbaI and were ligated into these restriction sites of pcDNA3.1+ expression vector (Invitrogen-Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) creating plasmids pcDNA3.1-WIP1-wild-type and pcDNA3.1-WIP1-mut-458. 522 has mosaic mutation ofPPM1Dand that the mutant cells constitute a large proportion of peripheral white blood cell population. The difference in frequency of truncating mutations between SCC and adenocarcinomas is not due to more frequent use of chemotherapy in SCC, because SCC cases less frequently underwent chemotherapy than adenocarcinoma cases (197/328, 60%versus79/104, 76%P=0.005 bychi2test). As expected, the camptothecin treatment induced stronger accumulation of total p53 and induced stronger expression of endogenous p21 protein. This is the first report onPPM1Dmutations in blood DNA of NSCLC patients. Another study reported 1.5% of ovarian cancer cases with truncating mutations ofPPM1D(AkbariNone, 2014). ThePPM1Dtruncating mutations arising somatically were recently found in brainstem gliomas (ZhangNone, 2014). The mutations that we and others have detected are located within the mutation cluster region identified inPPM1DbyRuarkNone(2013). It is assumed that all truncating mutations in the mutation cluster region ofPPM1Dare of gain-of-function type. Specifically,FuchsNone(1995)demonstrated that Ser15 phosphorylation mutant retains transcription activity and ability to suppress cell growth.
