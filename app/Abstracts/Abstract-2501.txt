The germline mutations ofTP53gene increase the risk of various cancers (McBrideNone, 2014). This phosphate can be removed by a phosphatase coded byPPM1D(WIP1) gene (LuNone, 2005). WIP1 also dephosphorylates kinases that activate p53 (e.g., ATM, CHK2) (ShreeramNone, 2006;Oliva-TrastoyNone, 2007). In U-2 OS cells, we detected a nonsense mutation in codon 458 ofPPM1D(Arg458X). Initially, the functional significance of this mutation was unknown (ZajkowiczNone, 2013). Independently, this mutation was reported by others (KleiblovaNone, 2013). They found similar truncating mutation in another cell line (HCT116) used in studies of p53. Similar mutations ofPPM1Dwere also found by others in leukocytes of ovarian cancer patients (AkbariNone, 2014). We decided to find out whether truncating mutations ofPPM1Dare present in blood DNA samples from lung cancer patients. The PCR products were prepared for sequencing by treatment with exonuclease I and shrimp alkaline phosphatase (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The cDNA was amplified with Proof Start polymerase (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) using primers: WIP-SQ1 AACAATAGTTGGCCGGCGAG and WIP-SQ12 GTTCAACATCGGCACCAAAT amplifying the whole coding sequence ofPPM1D. The wild-type p53 was expressed from pC53-SN3 plasmid, which was a gift from Dr. Bert Vogelstein and Dr. Kenneth W. Kinzler from Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA (BakerNone, 1990). To further examine the influence of various forms of WIP1 on the ability of p53 to transactivate genes, we used another experimental system employing the reporter vectors containing the p53-responsive gene promoters. This is the first report onPPM1Dmutations in blood DNA of NSCLC patients. Another study reported 1.5% of ovarian cancer cases with truncating mutations ofPPM1D(AkbariNone, 2014). ThePPM1Dtruncating mutations arising somatically were recently found in brainstem gliomas (ZhangNone, 2014). The mutations that we and others have detected are located within the mutation cluster region identified inPPM1DbyRuarkNone(2013). We found no evidence that hyperactive WIP1 can modulate the ability of p53 to activate the promoters either of endogenous genes or the promoters cloned in reporter vectors (Figures 3,4,5). Specifically,FuchsNone(1995)demonstrated that Ser15 phosphorylation mutant retains transcription activity and ability to suppress cell growth. We have also noticed in our previous experiments that downregulation of WIP1 with shRNA in U-2 OS cells promotes the expression of p21 in untreated cells (ZajkowiczNone, 2013). At this moment, we cannot judge whether this is enough time to generate and expand the mutant clone of white blood cells. The variant with Lys469Glu amino acid substitution is equivalent to wild type in our experiments.
