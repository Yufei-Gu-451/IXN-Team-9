The germline mutations of components of p53 signalling system (e.g.,ATM) also modulate cancer risk (Shiloh, 2003). The kinase coded byATMparticipates directly in activation of p53 by phosphorylating its serine 15 (BaninNone, 1998;CanmanNone, 1998). This phosphate can be removed by a phosphatase coded byPPM1D(WIP1) gene (LuNone, 2005). WIP1 also dephosphorylates kinases that activate p53 (e.g., ATM, CHK2) (ShreeramNone, 2006;Oliva-TrastoyNone, 2007). They found similar truncating mutation in another cell line (HCT116) used in studies of p53. Moreover, truncating mutations ofPPM1Dwere revealed in blood DNA from colorectal cancer patients. These authors sequenced the whole coding region ofPPM1Din many patients but found that the truncating mutations (either frameshift or nonsense) cluster within the last coding exon ofPPM1D(exon 6). The cDNA was amplified with Proof Start polymerase (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) using primers: WIP-SQ1 AACAATAGTTGGCCGGCGAG and WIP-SQ12 GTTCAACATCGGCACCAAAT amplifying the whole coding sequence ofPPM1D. Subsequently, the nested PCR was performed with Proof Start polymerase and primers: WIP-CLO1 and WIP-CLO2, which are nested in the first PCR product. The transfection mixture also contained pRL-TK vector (0.012 mug) coding forRenilla sp. 522 has mosaic mutation ofPPM1Dand that the mutant cells constitute a large proportion of peripheral white blood cell population. It is not known whether they are functionally neutral or modulate the activity of WIP1 phosphatase. The recombinant WIP1 is expressed from the vectors as shown on immunoblot (Figure 3). In our experiment, the expression of any form of WIP1 lowered the level of p53 with phosphorylated serine 15 without changing the total amount of p53 (Figure 3). This is consistent with the observations that the truncated WIP1 codes for gain-of-function mutants (KleiblovaNone, 2013;RuarkNone, 2013). This is the first report onPPM1Dmutations in blood DNA of NSCLC patients. Another study reported 1.5% of ovarian cancer cases with truncating mutations ofPPM1D(AkbariNone, 2014). We found no evidence that hyperactive WIP1 can modulate the ability of p53 to activate the promoters either of endogenous genes or the promoters cloned in reporter vectors (Figures 3,4,5). Specifically,FuchsNone(1995)demonstrated that Ser15 phosphorylation mutant retains transcription activity and ability to suppress cell growth. We have also noticed in our previous experiments that downregulation of WIP1 with shRNA in U-2 OS cells promotes the expression of p21 in untreated cells (ZajkowiczNone, 2013). WIP1 can dephosphorylate other proteins, including components of the base excision repair, what is associated with decreased activity of this DNA repair system (LuNone, 2004).
