The germline mutations ofTP53gene increase the risk of various cancers (McBrideNone, 2014). This phosphate can be removed by a phosphatase coded byPPM1D(WIP1) gene (LuNone, 2005). In U-2 OS cells, we detected a nonsense mutation in codon 458 ofPPM1D(Arg458X). The presence of mutantPPM1Din normal cells of cancer patients suggests that the mutations were transmitted in germline and contributed to carcinogenesis. Similar mutations ofPPM1Dwere also found by others in leukocytes of ovarian cancer patients (AkbariNone, 2014). We decided to find out whether truncating mutations ofPPM1Dare present in blood DNA samples from lung cancer patients. The exon 6 ofPPM1Dgene was amplified by PCR with AmpliTaq Gold polymerase (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and the following primers: WIP-P11 TAGTGAATGCATACCCCGTT (forward), WIP-P12 CAAGCAAGTACAAGGCCAGGA (reverse). The next day, the cells were transfected, according to the manufacturer's protocol, using FuGene6 (1,2 mul per well) with the combination of the reporter vector coding for firefly luciferase under the control of eitherBAXorMDM2promoters (0.12 mug), the expression vector pC53-SN3 (p53 plasmid, 0.18 mug) and the expression vector (0.3 mug) coding for wild-type or mutant cDNA ofWIP1 (PPM1D). The coding region of exon 6 ofPPM1Dwas sequenced in DNA samples isolated from blood of 543 NSCLC patients. This gave us better estimation of proportion of wild-typeversusmutant sequence in DNA sample than the 'height' of electropherogram peaks. The difference in frequency of truncating mutations between SCC and adenocarcinomas is not due to more frequent use of chemotherapy in SCC, because SCC cases less frequently underwent chemotherapy than adenocarcinoma cases (197/328, 60%versus79/104, 76%P=0.005 bychi2test). We have created expression vectors coding for wild-type or mutant versions of WIP1 protein (Mut458, Mut469). In this case, we have additionally treated the cells with camptothecin, which is a strong activator of p53 (Figure 4). Similar to previous experiment, the Ser15 phosphorylation status of p53 did not modulate the expression of endogenous p21. Moreover, we conclude that WIP1 protein with Lys469Glu substitution does not significantly differ from wild type in our experiments. Another study reported 1.5% of ovarian cancer cases with truncating mutations ofPPM1D(AkbariNone, 2014). ThePPM1Dtruncating mutations arising somatically were recently found in brainstem gliomas (ZhangNone, 2014). The mutations that we and others have detected are located within the mutation cluster region identified inPPM1DbyRuarkNone(2013). It is assumed that all truncating mutations in the mutation cluster region ofPPM1Dare of gain-of-function type. However, more precise estimation of proportion of mutant and wild-type sequence (see Results) performed by cloning of PCR product strongly suggests mosaicism. Specifically,FuchsNone(1995)demonstrated that Ser15 phosphorylation mutant retains transcription activity and ability to suppress cell growth.
