The germline mutations ofTP53gene increase the risk of various cancers (McBrideNone, 2014). They found similar truncating mutation in another cell line (HCT116) used in studies of p53. Moreover, truncating mutations ofPPM1Dwere revealed in blood DNA from colorectal cancer patients. We decided to find out whether truncating mutations ofPPM1Dare present in blood DNA samples from lung cancer patients. The sequencing reaction was performed using BigDye Terminator v.3.1 cycle sequencing kit (Life Technologies) and the forward primer (TCACATGCATAGATTTGTTGAGTTC) located in intron 5. The humanMDM2promoter 2 containing two p53-responsive elements (ZaubermanNone, 1995) was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA sample using primers: TTTTGCTAGCCTTTGTGCGGTTCGTGG, TTTTAAGCTTGCCTACAAGGAAAAAAAAGACA with the attached restriction sites for, respectively,NheI andHinDIII (underlined). The inserted DNA was sequenced to ensure that the clone contained no mutations introduced by PCR. The cDNA was amplified with Proof Start polymerase (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) using primers: WIP-SQ1 AACAATAGTTGGCCGGCGAG and WIP-SQ12 GTTCAACATCGGCACCAAAT amplifying the whole coding sequence ofPPM1D. Subsequently, the cloned PCR products were cut out from the pJET1.2/blunt vector withHinDIII andXbaI and were ligated into these restriction sites of pcDNA3.1+ expression vector (Invitrogen-Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) creating plasmids pcDNA3.1-WIP1-wild-type and pcDNA3.1-WIP1-mut-458. They were grown at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2, in DMEM medium (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (Gibco-Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich). The NCI-H1299 cells were transfected with FuGene6 (Promega), whereas SAOS-2 cells were transfected with Fugene HD (Active Motif, La Hulpe, Belgium) according to manufacturer's protocol. The null-control cells were transfected with empty expression vector (pcDNA3.1+). The following antibodies were used in the detection step: anti-p53 (DO1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology-SCBT, Dallas, TX, USA), anti-phospho-p53 at Ser 15 (rabbit polyclonal antibody from Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA), anti-p21 (F-5, SCBT), anti-MDM2 (HDM2-323, SCBT), anti-HSC70 (B-6, SCBT), anti-WIP1 (H-300, SCBT). The next day, the cells were transfected, according to the manufacturer's protocol, using FuGene6 (1,2 mul per well) with the combination of the reporter vector coding for firefly luciferase under the control of eitherBAXorMDM2promoters (0.12 mug), the expression vector pC53-SN3 (p53 plasmid, 0.18 mug) and the expression vector (0.3 mug) coding for wild-type or mutant cDNA ofWIP1 (PPM1D). The transfection mixture also contained pRL-TK vector (0.012 mug) coding forRenilla sp. 522 has mosaic mutation ofPPM1Dand that the mutant cells constitute a large proportion of peripheral white blood cell population. For the remaining 246 cases, which did not harbour mutations and for which the detailed dates of treatment were available, the mean time from the end of chemotherapy to the blood draw was 15.3 weeks (standard deviation +/-36.3 weeks, median 6.1 weeks, range 0-363 weeks). The difference in frequency of truncating mutations between SCC and adenocarcinomas is not due to more frequent use of chemotherapy in SCC, because SCC cases less frequently underwent chemotherapy than adenocarcinoma cases (197/328, 60%versus79/104, 76%P=0.005 bychi2test). Three variants have been identified by others and are listed in the short nucleotide polymorphisms databasehttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp. It is not known whether they are functionally neutral or modulate the activity of WIP1 phosphatase. The recombinant WIP1 is expressed from the vectors as shown on immunoblot (Figure 3). The amount of the protein with Lys469Glu substitution is similar to the amount of wild-type protein. As expected, the camptothecin treatment induced stronger accumulation of total p53 and induced stronger expression of endogenous p21 protein. Thus, the observations made using different experimental settings suggest that very strong expression of mutant WIP1, which clearly has the ability to diminish p53 phosphorylation on Ser15, does not measurably influence the ability of p53 to regulate the expression of its target genes. Moreover, we conclude that WIP1 protein with Lys469Glu substitution does not significantly differ from wild type in our experiments. This is the first report onPPM1Dmutations in blood DNA of NSCLC patients. The frequency of NSCLC cases with mutations (0.92%) is higher than the frequency of colorectal cancer patients (0.66%) (KleiblovaNone, 2013) and breast cancer patients (0.26%), but very similar to the frequency of ovarian cancer patients (1.07%) (RuarkNone, 2013). The gain-of-function nature of the following mutations was assessed and confirmed: c.1384C greater than T (p.Q462X), c.1420delC (RuarkNone, 2013), c.1349delT (p.450X), c.1372C greater than T (p.R458X) (KleiblovaNone, 2013). It is assumed that all truncating mutations in the mutation cluster region ofPPM1Dare of gain-of-function type. Our observations apparently contrasts with the data published by others (KleiblovaNone2013) who showed that knockdown of WIP1 (either its mutant or wild-type form) promotes the expression of p21-the product of p53 target gene. We have also noticed in our previous experiments that downregulation of WIP1 with shRNA in U-2 OS cells promotes the expression of p21 in untreated cells (ZajkowiczNone, 2013). There are numerous examples showing that chemotherapeutic agents promote mutagenesis and the formation of therapy-induced cancers, for example, radiotherapy for Hodgkin lymphoma significantly increases risk of lung cancer, and the risk of developing leukaemia is elevated after platinum-based chemotherapy for testicular or ovarian cancer.
