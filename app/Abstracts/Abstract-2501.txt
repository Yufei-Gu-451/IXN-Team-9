PPM1D (WIP1) negatively regulates by dephosphorylation many proteins including p53 tumour suppressor. The truncating mutations (nonsense and frameshift) in exon 6 ofThe exon 6 ofThe frameshift mutations were found in five NSCLC patients (5/543; 0.92%), all of them had squamous cell carcinomas (5/328; 1.5%). All patients with the mutations were exposed, before the blood collection, to the DNA damaging agents as a part of chemotherapeutic regimen. Functional tests demonstrated that truncating mutation Arg458X causes enhancement of dephosphorylation activity of PPM1D toward serine 15 of p53, whereas Lys469Glu version is equivalent to the wild-type. Neither version of PPM1D (wild-type, Arg458X, Lys469Glu) significantly modulated the ability of p53 to transactivate promoters of the examined p53-target genes (The truncating mutations of
