There is a lack of consensus across international organizations regarding definitions of prediabetes. Associations with complications can inform the comparative value of different prediabetes definitions. We conducted a prospective cohort study of 10,844 Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study participants without diagnosed diabetes who attended visit 2 (1990-92) and 7,194 who attended visit 4 (1996-98). Fasting glucose and HbA1c were measured at visit 2 and fasting glucose and 2-hour glucose were measured at visit 4. We compared prediabetes definitions based on fasting glucose (American Diabetes Association [ADA] 5.6-6.9 mmol/L and World Health Organization [WHO] 6.1-6.9 mmol/L), HbA1c (ADA 39-46 mmol/mol and International Expert Committee [IEC] 42-46 mmol/mol), and 2-hour glucose (ADA/WHO 7.8-11.0 mmol/L). ADA fasting glucose-defined prediabetes (prevalence 37.9%) was the most sensitive for major clinical outcomes, while ADA and IEC HbA1c and WHO fasting glucose-based definitions (prevalence 18.7%, 9.0%, 11.2%, respectively) were more specific. After demographic adjustment, HbA1c-based definitions of prediabetes had higher hazard ratios and demonstrated better risk discrimination for chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease, and all-cause mortality compared to fasting glucose (modestly larger C-statistics, allOur results suggest that HbA1c-defined prediabetes definitions were more specific and provided modest improvements in risk discrimination for clinical complications. ADA fasting glucose was a more sensitive definition overall.
