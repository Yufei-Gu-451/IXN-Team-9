Bone and dentin are mineralized extracellular matrices produced by osteoblasts and odontoblasts, respectively, and their major organic portion is type I collagen. Dentinogenesis Imperfecta (DGI) is one of the most common clinically- and genetically-based disturbances of dentin formation, causing irreversible dentin defects. Among several types of DGI, patients with DGI type II exhibit opalescent dentin with partial or complete pulp obliteration. It has been previously reported that the non-sense mutation (c.133C greater than T) inRecombinant N-terminal DSP (N-DSP) protein was generated. N-DSP mimics the non-sense mutation form of Dentinogenesis Imperfecta type II. N-DSP enhances bone formation in clavarial ex vivo cultures. N-DSP accelerates osteoblast proliferation. N-DSP upregulates type I collagen and Dspp expression in non-odontogenic osteoblasts.
