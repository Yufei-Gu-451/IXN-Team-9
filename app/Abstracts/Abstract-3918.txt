To explore associations between diabetes etiology (type 1 diabetes mellitus [T1DM] vs. T2DM) and glycemic control in the prediction of 5-year periodontal status change. The Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP) is a population-based stratified sample of German men and women. Healthy participants and those determined to have T2DM arose from the SHIP cohort, and T1DM participants were recruited from diabetes clinics in the catchment area that gave rise to SHIP. Dentate participants (Mean (SD) DeltaMPD and DeltaMAL values among all participants were -0.08 +/- 0.5 mm and 0.08 +/- 1.03 mm, respectively, and 34% lost one or more teeth. Relative to diabetes-free participants, those with uncontrolled T2DM experienced greater DeltaMPD +/- SE (Diabetes control, but not etiology, was associated with future tooth loss and accelerated AL progression.
