The ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) is essential for normal insulin secretion from beta-cells. The aim of this study was to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the impaired insulin secretion in islets lacking beta-cell ABCA1. Calcium imaging, patch clamp, and membrane capacitance were used to assess the effect of ABCA1 deficiency on calcium flux, ion channel function, and exocytosis in islet cells. Electron microscopy was used to analyze beta-cell ultrastructure. The quantity and distribution of proteins involved in insulin-granule exocytosis were also investigated. We show that a lack of beta-cellOur data highlight a crucial role of ABCA1 and cellular cholesterol in beta-cells that is necessary for regulated insulin granule fusion events. These data suggest that abnormalities of cholesterol metabolism may contribute to the impaired beta-cell function in diabetes.
