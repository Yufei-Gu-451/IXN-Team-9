This study investigated the usefulness of a novel inflammation-based prognostic system, named the COP-NLR (COmbination of Platelet count and Neutrophil to Lymphocyte Ratio), for predicting the postoperative survival of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). The COP-NLR was calculated on the basis of data obtained on the day of admission: patients with both an elevated platelet count ( greater than 30 * 10Four-hundred and eighty patients were enrolled. Multivariate analysis of clinical characteristics selected by univariate analysis showed that the COP-NLR (1, 2/0) (odds ratio, 0.464; 95% confidence interval, 0.267-0.807;The COP-NLR is considered to be a useful predictor of postoperative survival in patients with CRC.
