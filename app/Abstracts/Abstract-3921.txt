Epidemiological studies and randomized clinical trials have demonstrated in various populations that resting heart rate (RHR) was an independent predictor of cardiovascular (CV) risk and all-cause mortality. However, few data specifically evaluated the relationship between RHR and long-term CV and renal complications in a large population of type 2 diabetic (T2D) patients. We performed a single-center, prospective analysis in 1,088 T2D patients. RHR was determined at baseline by electrocardiogram. The primary outcome was a composite criterion of CV and renal morbi-mortality (CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction and/or stroke, hospitalization for heart failure, renal replacement therapy), which was adjusted for death from non-CV cause as a competing event. The secondary outcome was a renal composite criterion (renal replacement therapy or doubling of baseline serum creatinine) adjusted for all-cause death as a competing event. During median follow-up of 4.2 years, 253 patients (23%) and 62 patients (6%) experienced the primary and secondary outcomes, respectively. In the subgroup of patients with CV disease history at baseline (In the real-life setting, RHR constitutes an easy and less time-consuming factor that would permit identification of CV disease diabetic patients with an increased risk for long-term CV and renal complications.
