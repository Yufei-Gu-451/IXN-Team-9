It has been suggested that the high prevalence of subnormal free testosterone concentrations, along with low or inappropriately normal gonadotropins in men with type 2 diabetes, may be the result of an increase in plasma estradiol concentrations secondary to an increase in aromatase activity in the adipose tissue that leads to the suppression of the hypothalamo-hypophyseal-gonadal axis. To investigate this hypothesis, plasma estradiol, testosterone, leutinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) concentrations were measured in fasting blood samples of 240 men with type 2 diabetes. Free estradiol concentrations were either calculated (The calculated free estradiol concentration in men with subnormal free testosterone concentrations was lower than that in men with normal free testosterone concentrations (median 0.047 vs. 0.063 ng/dL,These data show that the suppression of the hypothalamo-hypophyseal-gonadal axis in patients with subnormal free testosterone concentrations and type 2 diabetes is not associated with increased estradiol concentrations. The pathogenesis of subnormal free testosterone concentrations in type 2 diabetes needs to be investigated further.
