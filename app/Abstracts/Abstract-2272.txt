Although the haptoglobin (Hp) 1-1 genotype is associated with a lower coronary artery disease (CAD) risk in diabetes, we recently reported an increased stroke incidence in type 1 diabetes with Hp 1-1. We, thus, evaluated differences in earlier brain vascular abnormality markers by Hp using neuroimaging. Neuroimaging was completed in 94 participants of the Pittsburgh Epidemiology of Diabetes Complications study with Hp genotyping available (mean age, 49; duration, 41 years). White matter hyperintensities (WMH) volume, lacunar infarcts, and gray matter atrophy were quantified. Sixteen percent were homozygous for Hp 1 and 43% for Hp 2. A significant trend toward increased WMH was observed with greater duration and the number of Hp 1 alleles. Associations were strongest for the interhemispheric connecting fibers of the corpus callosum. Allowing for duration, sex, waist-to-hip ratio, HbA
