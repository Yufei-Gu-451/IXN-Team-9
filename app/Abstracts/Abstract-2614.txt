MicroRNA-210 (miR-210) is an oncogenic miRNA previously associated with prognosis in human gliomas, an incurable tumour type of the central nervous system. Here miR-210 was investigated as a potential serum biomarker in the diagnosis and prognosis of glioma. Serum was immediately prepared from blood samples collected from patients with glioma grades I-IV at primary diagnosis (An approximately seven-fold increase in miR-210 expression was detected in serum samples from glioblastoma patients relative to healthy controls. A threshold expression value (2.259) was chosen from receiver operator characteristic curves (ROC), and the low and high miR-210 expression groups were analysed by multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression and Kaplan-Meier analyses. Results revealed an association of high serum miR-210 expression with tumour grade and poor patient outcome (Serum miR-210 is a promising diagnostic and prognostic biomarker that can be detected in the peripheral blood of patients with glioma.
