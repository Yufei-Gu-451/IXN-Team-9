Metastasis of solid tumors is associated with poor prognosis and bleak survival rates. Tumor infiltrating myeloid cells (TIMs) are known to promote metastasis but the mechanisms underlying their collaboration with tumor cells remain unknown. Here we report an oncogenic role for microRNA in driving M2 reprogramming in TIMs, characterized by the acquisition of pro-tumor and pro-angiogenic properties. The expression of miR-21, miR-29a, miR-142-3p and miR-223 increased in myeloid cells during tumor progression in mouse models of breast cancer and melanoma metastasis. Further, we show that these miRs are regulated by the CSF1-ETS2 pathway in macrophages. A loss of function approach utilizing selective depletion of the microRNA processing enzyme
