The objective of this review article is to learn how to recognize anatomic variants and benign entities that mimic bladder cancer at computed tomography (CT) urography. Building on recent data that suggest that CT urography can be used to diagnose bladder cancer, recognition of anatomic variants and benign entities will help improve radiologists' ability to diagnose bladder cancer.
