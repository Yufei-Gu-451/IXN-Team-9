Despite abundant sunshine, hypovitaminosis D is common in the Middle East. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of hypovitaminosis D and related correlates among patients with hip fracture in Assiut University Hospitals in Upper Egypt. A cross-sectional study was carried out in 133 patients with hip fracture, aged 50 years and older, admitted to Trauma Unit of Assiut University Hospitals, from January through December 2014. Patients were selected by systematic random sampling. Serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D level was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; bone mineral density (BMD) by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Weight and height measurements were used for body mass index (BMI) calculation. Prevalence of hypovitaminosis D is high among patients with hip fracture and associated with low BMD and high BMI. Increasing awareness about prevention as well as detection and treatment of vitamin D deficiency is recommended.
