The integrin alpha9beta1 binds a number of extracellular matrix components to mediate cell adhesion, migration and tissue invasion. Although expressed in variety of normal human cells including endothelium, it is also expressed in cancer cells. We have previously shown that alpha9beta1 binds VEGF-A to facilitate angiogenesis, an important component of the tumor microenvironment. Since alpha9beta1 induces accelerated cancer cell migration, we wished to determine what role it played in cancer growth and metastasis. In this study we show that alpha9beta1 expression induces molecular changes consistent with epithelial-mesenchymal transition. In addition, we found that alpha9beta1 forms a tri-partite protein complex with beta-catenin and E-cadherin, which dissociates following integrin activation and subsequent src and beta-catenin phosphorylation. These findings were consistent in cells in which: alpha9beta1 was exogenously over-expressed, or when its expression was suppressed in cancer cells endogenously expressing alpha9beta1. These in vitro results are biologically significant since alpha9beta1 expressing cancer cells induce greater tumor growth and metastases in mice as compared to cells without alpha9beta1 expression or when integrin expression is suppressed. Furthermore, integrin alpha9beta1 is expressed in primary human small cell lung cancer and patients having a high expression of alpha9beta1 demonstrated significantly worse long term survival compared to patients with low alpha9beta1 expression. These findings highlight a novel mechanism of integrin alpha9beta1 function in human cancer.
