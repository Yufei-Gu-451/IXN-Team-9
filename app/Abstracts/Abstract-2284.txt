To assess changes in total adipose tissue (TAT), subcutaneous (SAT), visceral (VAT), and intermuscular (IMAT) by whole-body MRI before surgery, at 12 months and 24 months post-surgery in a subset of participants of the Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery-2. From 0 to 12 months, n=20F and 3M; from 12 to 24 months, n=42F and 7M. Paired t-tests and GLM repeated measures examined changes in TAT, SAT, VAT, and IMAT at 12 and 24 months, with sex and age as covariates. Changes from 0 to 12 months, included weight (-41.9+/-12.1kg; -36%), TAT (-33.5+/-9.6kg; -56%), SAT (-29.2+/-8.2kg; -55%), VAT (-3.3+/-1.6kg; -73%), and IMAT (-0.99+/-0.68kg; -50%), all p less than 0.001. In females, from 12 to 24 months, despite relative weight stability (-1.8+/-6.5kg, -2%; p=0.085), VAT (-0.5+/-0.7kg; -30%; p less than 0.001) and IMAT (-0.2+/-0.4kg; -14%; p=0.012) decreased further. In males from 12 to 24 months, weight increased (5.1+/-5.2kg; 6%; p=0.04) with no significant changes in TAT or sub-depots. Bariatric surgery continues to induce favorable changes in body composition, i.e., persistent adipose tissue loss at 24 months in the absence of further significant weight loss.
