This review focuses on the development of acid catalysis for selective organic transformations conducted in our laboratories for the past 30 years. Several important concepts in designing of catalysts are described with some examples. Further, recent developments in super Bronsted acid and their applications in a one-pot procedure to construct complex molecules with high diastereoselectivities are described.
