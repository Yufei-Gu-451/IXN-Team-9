We have recently shown that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) embedded in a hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogel and exposed to chondrogenic factors (transforming growth factor-beta3 [TGF-beta3]) produce a cartilage-like tissueTrochlear chondral defects were created in Yucatan mini-pigs (6 months old). Treatment groups included an HA hydrogel alone and hydrogels containing allogeneic MSCs, TGF-beta3, or both. Six weeks after surgery, micro-computed tomography was used to quantitatively assess defect fill and subchondral bone remodeling. The quality of cartilage repair was assessed using the ICRS-II histological scoring system and immunohistochemistry for type II collagen. Treatment with TGF-beta3 led to a marked increase in positive staining for collagen type II within defects (At this early healing time point, treatment with TGF-beta3 promoted the formation of collagen type II within the defect, while allogeneic MSCs had little benefit. Combination of TGF-beta3 and MSCs at the time of surgery did not produce a synergistic effect. An
