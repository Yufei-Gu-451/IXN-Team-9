Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and fatal primary brain tumor in humans and it is essential that new and better therapies are developed to treat this disease. Previous research suggests that casein kinase 2 (CK2), may be a promising therapeutic target for GBMs. CK2 has enhanced expression or activity in numerous cancers, including GBM and it has been demonstrated that inhibitors of CK2 regressed tumor growth in GBM xenograft mouse models. Our studies demonstrate that the CK2 subunit, CK2alpha, is overexpressed in and plays an important role in regulating brain tumor initiating cells (BTIC) in GBM. Initial studies showed that two GBM cell lines (U87-MG and U138) transduced with CK2alpha had enhanced proliferation and anchorage-independent growth. Inhibition of CK2alpha using siRNA or small molecule inhibitors (TBBz, CX-4945) reduced cell growth and decreased tumor size and increased the survival rate in GBM xenograft mouse models. We also verified that inhibition of CK2alpha decreased the activity of a well-known GBM initiating cell regulator, beta-catenin. Loss of CK2alpha decreased two beta-catenin-regulated genes that are involved in GBM initiating cell growth,
