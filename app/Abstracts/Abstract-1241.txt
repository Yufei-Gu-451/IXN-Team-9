The pregnane X receptor (PXR), along with its sister receptor constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), was initially characterized as a xenobiotic receptor that regulates drug metabolism. In this study, we have uncovered an unexpected endobiotic role of PXR in obesity and type 2 diabetes. PXR ablation inhibited high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity, hepatic steatosis, and insulin resistance, which were accounted for by increased oxygen consumption, increased mitochondrial beta-oxidation, inhibition of hepatic lipogenesis and inflammation, and sensitization of insulin signaling. In an independent model, introducing the
