Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the major life-threatening complication of diabetes. Abnormal permselectivity of glomerular basement membrane (GBM) plays an important role in DN pathogenesis. Heparanase is the predominant enzyme that degrades heparan sulfate (HS), the main polysaccharide of the GBM. Loss of GBM HS in diabetic kidney was associated with increased glomerular expression of heparanase; however, the causal involvement of heparanase in the pathogenesis of DN has not been demonstrated. We report for the first time the essential involvement of heparanase in DN. With the use of
