Protein kinase C betaII (PKCbetaII) levels increase in the myocardium of patients with end-stage heart failure (HF). Also targeted overexpression of PKCbetaII in the myocardium of mice leads to dilated cardiomyopathy associated with inflammation, fibrosis and myocardial dysfunction. These reports suggest a deleterious role of PKCbetaII in HF development. Using a post-myocardial infarction (MI) model of HF in rats, we determined the benefit of chronic inhibition of PKCbetaII on the progression of HF over a period of 6 weeks after the onset of symptoms and the cellular basis for these effects. Four weeks after MI, rats with HF signs that were treated for 6 weeks with the PKCbetaII selective inhibitor (betaIIV5-3 conjugated to TAT
