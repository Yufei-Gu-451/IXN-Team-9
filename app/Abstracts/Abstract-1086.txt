Long-term clinical outcome of islet transplantation is hampered by the rejection and recurrence of autoimmunity. Accurate monitoring may allow for early detection and treatment of these potentially compromising immune events. Islet transplant outcome was analyzed in 59 consecutive pancreatic islet recipients in whom baseline and de novo posttransplant autoantibodies (GAD antibody, insulinoma-associated protein 2 antigen, zinc transporter type 8 antigen) and donor-specific alloantibodies (DSA) were quantified. Thirty-nine recipients (66%) showed DSA or autoantibody increases (de novo expression or titer increase) after islet transplantation. Recipients who had a posttransplant antibody increase showed similar initial performance but significantly lower graft survival than patients without an increase (islet autoantibodies
