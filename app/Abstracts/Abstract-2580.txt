The biomechanics literature contains many well-understood mechanisms behind typical fracture types that have important roles in treatment planning. The recent association of "atypical" fractures with long-term use of drugs designed to prevent osteoporosis has renewed interest in the effects of agents on bone tissue-level quality. While this class of fracture was recognized prior to the introduction of the anti-resorptive bisphosphonate drugs and recently likened to stress fractures, the mechanism(s) that lead to atypical fractures have not been definitively identified. Thus, a causal relationship between these drugs and atypical fracture has not been established. Physicians, bioengineers and others interested in the biomechanics of bone are working to improve fracture-prevention diagnostics, and the design of treatments to avoid this serious side-effect in the future. This review examines the mechanisms behind the bone tissue damage that may produce the atypical fracture pattern observed increasingly with long-term bisphosphonate use. Our recent findings and those of others reviewed support that the mechanisms behind normal, healthy excavation and tunnel filling by bone remodeling units within cortical tissue strengthen mechanical integrity. The ability of cortical bone to resist the damage induced during cyclic loading may be altered by the reduced remodeling and increased tissue age resulting from long-term bisphosphonate treatment. Development of assessments for such potential fractures would restore confidence in pharmaceutical treatments that have the potential to spare millions in our aging population from the morbidity and death that often follow bone fracture.
