Demonstrate safety and effectiveness of the light-driven contact hearing aid to support FDA clearance. A single-arm, open-label investigational-device clinical trial. Two private-practice and one hospital-based ENT clinics. Forty-three subjects (86 ears) with mild-to-severe bilateral sensorineural hearing impairment. Bilateral amplification delivered via a light-driven contact hearing aid comprising a Tympanic Lens (Lens) with a customized platform to directly drive the umbo and a behind-the-ear sound processor (Processor) that encodes sound into light pulses to wirelessly deliver signal and power to the Lens. The primary safety endpoint was a determination of "no change" (PTA4 less than 10 dB) in residual unaided hearing at the 120-day measurement interval. The primary efficacy endpoint was improvement in word recognition using NU-6 at the 30-day measurement interval over the baseline unaided case. Secondary efficacy endpoints included functional gain from 2 to 10 kHz and speech-in-noise improvement over the baseline unaided case using both omnidirectional and directional microphones. The results for the 86 ears in the study determined a mean change of -0.40 dB in PTA4, indicating no change in residual hearing (The safety and effectiveness data supported a de novo 510(k) submission that received clearance from the FDA.
