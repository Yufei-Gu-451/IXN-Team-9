Micrometastases in bone marrow of women with early breast cancer were first identified immunocytochemically in the 1980s. We report on the original cohort of women with a median follow-up of 30 years. In total, 350 women with primary breast cancer had eight bone marrow aspirates examined with antibody to epithelial membrane antigen. Data on long-term mortality were obtained via record linkage to death certification. At a 30-year median follow-up, 79 out of 89 (89%) patients with micrometastases have died compared with 202 out of 261 (77%) without (hazard ratio=1.46 (95% CI 1.12-1.90),Bone marrow micrometastases are predictive for OS, particularly in the first decade and in younger patients.
