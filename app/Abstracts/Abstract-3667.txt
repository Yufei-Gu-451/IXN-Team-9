To examine the performance of current screening recommendations for detecting dysglycemia in children and adolescents with obesity. In a cross-sectional study, an oral glucose tolerance test and demographic (age, sex, family history of diabetes, and ethnicity), clinical (BMIDysglycemia was present in 20.8% of the cohort. Of the 54 participants with dysglycemia, 68% had a normal fasting glucose and were identified with the 2-h glucose test. Current ADA criteria had low sensitivity (41.7% [95% CI 25.6-57.8]) and moderate specificity (69.5% [63.5-75.6]) to identify IGT. In receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, the addition of hemoglobin AThe prevalence of IGT is high among obese children and youth. Current screening criteria have low sensitivity to detect isolated IGT. Although adding nonfasting laboratory values to history and physical measures does not improve diagnostic accuracy, adding fasting lipid profile improves predictive value.
