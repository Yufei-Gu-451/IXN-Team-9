Cluster analysis was performed on the results of self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) to discriminate islet graft function after islet cell transplantation (ICT) in patients with type 1 diabetes. Eleven islet recipients were included in this study. The patients visited our clinic monthly after ICT and provided blood samples for fasting C-peptide (Analysis for SMBG assessments revealed five types of clusters, which showed similar patterns according to functional or dysfunctional islet graft phase. Two clusters, the euglycemia cluster (Cluster analysis of SMBG data as part of an automated data quality system could allow discrimination of islet graft dysfunction after ICT. This approach should be considered for islet recipients.
