Muller cells and macrophages/microglia are likely important for the development of diabetic retinopathy; however, the interplay between these cells in this disease is not well understood. An inflammatory process is linked to the onset of experimental diabetic retinopathy. CD40 deficiency impairs this process and prevents diabetic retinopathy. Using mice with CD40 expression restricted to Muller cells, we identified a mechanism by which Muller cells trigger proinflammatory cytokine expression in myeloid cells. During diabetes, mice with CD40 expressed in Muller cells upregulated retinal tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta), intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), and nitric oxide synthase (NOS2), developed leukostasis and capillary degeneration. However, CD40 did not cause TNF-alpha or IL-1beta secretion in Muller cells. TNF-alpha was not detected in Muller cells from diabetic mice with CD40
