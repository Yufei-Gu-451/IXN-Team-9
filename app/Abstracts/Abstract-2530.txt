A productive cough also appeared subsequently. On examination, her vital signs were stable. Based on the above findings, the surgical removal of the FB was performed with the heart beating. The surface of the heart was found to be covered with a layer of cellulose-like substance, especially at the area of right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT), and one puncture site was also observed in the RVOT. With the beating of the heart, a small amount of blood was discharged intermittently from the pinhole. Remarkable fibrous deposits could be seen in the heart around this needle and were removed during the surgery. The operation was completed without any complication. In our case, we still cannot distinguish whether the sewing needle was swallowed by the child or was inserted through the chest wall accidently by herself or someone else. Thus, we speculate that the sewing needle may have been located in the heart for a period of time, as the injured tissue around its tract required time to repair.
