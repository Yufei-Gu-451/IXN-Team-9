Intersectin-1s (ITSN-1s), a five Src homology 3 (SH3) domain-containing protein, is critically required for caveolae and clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), due to its interactions with dynamin (dyn). Of the five SH3A-E domains, SH3A is unique because of its high affinity for dyn and potent inhibition of CME. However, the molecular mechanism by which SH3A integrates in the overall function of ITSN-1s to regulate the endocytic process is not understood. Using biochemical and functional approaches as well as high-resolution electron microscopy, we show that SH3A exogenously expressed in human lung endothelial cells caused abnormal endocytic structures, distorted caveolae clusters, frequent staining-dense rings around the caveolar necks and 60% inhibition of caveolae internalization.
