Nonlinear optical (NLO) instrumentation has been integrated with synchrotron X-ray diffraction for combined single-platform analysis, examining the viability of NLO microscopy as an alternative to the conventional X-ray raster scan for the purposes of sample centering. Second-harmonic generation microscopy and two-photon excited ultraviolet fluorescence microscopy were evaluated for crystal detection, and assessed by X-ray raster scanning. Nonlinear optical (NLO) instrumentation has been integrated with synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) for combined single-platform analysis, initially targeting applications for automated crystal centering. Second-harmonic-generation microscopy and two-photon-excited ultraviolet fluorescence microscopy were evaluated for crystal detection and assessed by X-ray raster scanning. Two optical designs were constructed and characterized; one positioned downstream of the sample and one integrated into the upstream optical path of the diffractometer. Both instruments enabled protein crystal identification with integration times between 80 and 150 us per pixel, representing a ?10
