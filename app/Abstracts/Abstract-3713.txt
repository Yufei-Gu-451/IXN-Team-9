Increased levels of intestinal VEGF are thought to worsen portal hypertension. The cause of the increase in the level of intestinal VEGF found during cirrhosis is not known. The aim of this study is to demonstrate a relationship between portal pressure (PP) and intestinal/ plasma VEGF levels in different stages of fibrosis/cirrhosis. In this experiment, rats were exposed to carbon tetrachloride (CCl
