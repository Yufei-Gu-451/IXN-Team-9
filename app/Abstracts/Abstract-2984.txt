The inability of insulin to increase skeletal muscle capillary blood volume (CBV) reduces glucose uptake in insulin resistance (IR). We hypothesized that abnormalities in endothelial-derived vasodilator pathways are temporally associated with the development of IR and an impaired ability to increase skeletal muscle CBV. A comprehensive metabolic and vascular screening assessment was performed on 10 adult rhesus macaques at baseline and every 4-6 months for 2 years after starting a high-fat diet supplemented with fructose. Diet changes resulted in an 80% increase in truncal fat by 4 months. Hyperinsulinemia and decreased glucose utilization were observed from 4 to 18 months. At 24 months, pancreatic secretory function and the glucose utilization rate declined. CBV at rest and during an intravenous glucose tolerance test demonstrated a sustained increase from 4 to 18 months and then abruptly fell at 24 months. Nitric oxide bioavailability progressively decreased over 2 years. Conversely, endothelial-derived vasodilators progressively increased over 18 months and then abruptly decreased at 24 months in concert with the CBV. The increase in basal and glucose-mediated CBV early in IR may represent a compensatory response through endothelial-derived vasodilator pathways. The inability to sustain a vascular compensatory response limits glucose-mediated increases in CBV, which correlates with the severity of IR.
