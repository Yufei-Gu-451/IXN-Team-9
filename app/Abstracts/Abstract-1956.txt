To determine if cytokine release with a solid phase assay is predictive of adverse responses for a range of therapeutic mAbs. Cytokine ELISAs and a multi-array system were used to compare responses generated by different therapeutic mAbs using a solid phase assay. Flow cytometry was employed to determine the cellular source of those cytokines. Only TGN1412 and muromonab-CD3 stimulated CD4+ T-cell mediated cytokine release characterized by significant (allThe severity of the adverse response to TGN1412 compared with muromonab-CD3 and other therapeutic mAbs correlates with the level of IL-2 release.
