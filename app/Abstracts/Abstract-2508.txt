Additionally, HPV-positive samples expressed significantly lower levels ofCox-2mRNA and higher levels ofPD-1mRNA than HPV-negative samples. The tumor grade and the stage were equivalent in patients with HPV-positive and HPV-negative HNSCC. The levels of tumor-infiltrating CD45+leucocytes were significantly higher in HPV-positive tumor samples (None). As expected, there were significantly higher numbers of CD8+T cells in HPV-positive tumor tissue samples compared to HPV-negative samples (None). We observed a trend to an increase in the numbers of total CD4+T cells as well as IFNgamma-producing CD4+cells (Th1 cells) in the HPV-positive tumor samples (p less than 0.1) (None). Additionally, we observed a slightly lower proportion of Tregs in HPV-positive tumors (None). (C) The white columns represent the mean cytokine production upon PMA and ionomycin stimulation after 24 h for culture supernatants from HPV-negative patients; the black columns represent the mean production from HPV-positive patients. We observed an increased frequency of all of these cell populations in patients with HPV-positive tumors. The total numbers of mDCs in HPV-positive tumor samples showed a statistically significant increase compared to HPV-negative samples; however, the frequency of pDCs and monocytes/macrophages were not statistically significantly different (None). To evaluate whether the increased frequency of leukocytes in HPV-positive tumor samples could be caused by the recruitment of leukocytes to tumor sites rather than their polarizationin situ, as shown in our previous study,Nonewe analyzed the chemokine and cytokine profiles of the tumor-derived cell culture supernatants. In addition to the flow cytometry data described above, we analyzed the mRNA expression levels of four regulatory genes,Cox-2,PD-1,PD-L1andTim-3, in the tumor tissue samples and in metastatic and control lymph nodes of patients with HPV-positive and HPV-negative tumors. On the contrary, we observed a significantly higher expression of PD-1 in HPV-positive tumor tissues compared to HPV-negative samples (p= 0.018). The mRNA expression level of Tim-3 was similar in both groups of patients (None). When the results were normalized to CD45+mRNA expression, we observed higher levels of PD-1 and lower levels of Tim-3 in HPV-positive tissue samples compared to HPV-negative tumors, but these differences were not statistically significant (None). (D) Dot plots are gated on CD3+CD8+cells (upper line) and CD3+CD4+cells (lower line) and show the expression ofTim-3andPD-1in the peripheral blood, control LN, metastatic LN and tumor tissue from a representative patient. WhereasPD-1was frequently expressed on CD8+and CD4+T cells in all of the tissues analyzed, particularly in the peripheral blood, control lymph nodes, metastatic lymph nodes and tumor tissue,Tim-3was mainly expressed on tumor-infiltrating T-lymphocytes (None). The role of CD4+T cells in anticancer immunity is more controversial. The role of Tregs seems to differ according to the type and etiology of the cancer. As nodal metastases were detected in 90.5% of the patients with HPV-positive and 66.7% of the patients with HPV-negative tumor samples, the differences in CXCL12 levels most likely reflect this fact. In mice, CCL17 was shown to be mainly produced by mature DCs of myeloid origin. Consistent with the flow cytometry data, we detected significantly higher levels of Tim-3 but notPD-1mRNA in tumor tissue compared to control lymph nodes. Noneshowed that high levels of tumor-infiltrating PD-1+ T cells correlated with better survival in HNSCC patients. In agreement with these results, we observed higherPD-1expression in HPV-positive tumor samples compared to HPV-negative tumors. The relative expression of the target genes was normalized to the expression of beta-actin.
