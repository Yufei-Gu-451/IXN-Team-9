Macrophages were eventually incorporated into the reticulo-endothelial system in 1924, implying that they originate from, and reside and renew within, that tissue. 4At this time, there was a reasonable body of evidence that macrophages were not terminally differentiated10-12and were persistent in tissues. It became evident that many tissue macrophage populations are renewed independently of the bone marrow, and therefore their origin was scrutinized. Fate-mapping studies showed that a significant number of tissue macrophages are derived from primitive macrophages existing within the yolk sac or fetal liver. 28,29These macrophages are seeded into the tissues before birth and proliferate to populate the expanding tissue with resident macrophages. Considering the majority of our knowledge on tissue macrophages is focused on rodents and cells with limited origins, the next logical questions for the field include: what effect does origin have on macrophage function? There have been notable studies on tissue niche-specific transcriptional control of macrophage populations in the past, such as in the spleen. Peritoneal B1 cells migrate to the gut and can secrete IgA. This enables cell survival in the tissue, but may restrict survival in other tissues. This modification is associated with enhancer regions in gene promoters. transferred macrophages from the peritoneum to the lung. This is dependent on the stimulus and resulting phenotype of the cell. Classical activation of tissue-resident macrophagesin vivohas usually been thought of as equivalent; however, it is likely that there are subtle differences, which are dependent upon environment and genetic/epigenetic programming. We now know that some tissue macrophages can renew their population independently from monocytes during inflammation19,21,22and have prenatal origins. These cells have been activated and then must return to homeostasis. This aspect of tissue macrophage biology has been largely under-studied because it is often assumed that activated macrophages perish. Therefore some macrophage subsets present during the later stages of inflammation, including wound healing, may in fact be recovering tissue-resident macrophages. 58This study appreciated that tissue-resident macrophages survive initial acute inflammation and persist during the recovery phase. The extreme heterogeneity of tissue-resident macrophages during homeostasis and inflammation shows that a macrophage cannot be just 'M1' or 'M2' when residing in a tissue. 62Although there is no new consensus model for macrophage phenotypein vivo, it has been suggested that macrophages be named by origin, and the historical nomenclature maintained for cells with an embryonic origin. 68Regardless of the origin, macrophages are a resident of the tumour site and contribute to tumour growth. These tissue feedback loops are probably important to maintain healthy tissue homeostasis.
