The purpose of this study was to evaluate cryotherapy effectiveness in the immediate postoperative period of ACL reconstruction to improve pain and range of motion (ROM) of the knee. This is a pilot study of a prospective and randomized clinical trial. Patients (n=25) were divided into two groups: Intervention (A) group (n=10): patients were submitted to an inpatient physical therapy protocol and received ice compress for 20 minutes, twice a day; Control (B) group (n=9): patients had the same protocol, twice a day. The pain intensity was evaluated with the visual analogic scale (VAS) and range of motion was measured with a goniometer. The Intervention (A) group had important absolute and percentual improvement when compared with the Control (B) group regarding measures of pain and knee flexion/extension ROM. Cryotherapy in the immediate postoperative period of ACL reconstruction was effective to improve pain and range of motion of the knee.
