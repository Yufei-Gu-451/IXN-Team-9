Hip fractures are common in the elderly and are likely to become more prevalent as the US population ages. Early functional status is an indicator of longer term outcome, yet in-hospital predictors of functional recovery, particularly time of surgery and composition of support staff, after hip fracture surgery have not been well studied. Ninety-nine consecutive patients underwent hip fracture surgery by a single surgeon between 2009 and 2013. Surgery after 48 hours was deemed as surgical delay, and surgery after 5On POD3, 48 (79%) of 62 patients with no delay were able to ambulate, whereas only 14 (38%) of 37 patients with delayed surgery were able to ambulate (Surgical delay and nonorthopedic scrub technicians are associated with worse early functional outcome after hip fracture surgery. Surgical delay should be avoided in older patients and women. More work should be done to understand the impact of surgical team composition on outcome.
