Opioid addiction is a chronic disease with high genetic contribution and a large inter-individual variability in therapeutic response. The goal of this study was to identify pharmacodynamic factors that modulate methadone dose requirement. The neurotrophin family is involved in neural plasticity, learning memory and behavior and deregulated neural plasticity may underlie the pathophysiology of drug addiction. BDNF was shown to affect the response to methadone maintenance treatment. This study explores the effects of polymorphisms in the nerve growth factor (beta polypeptide) gene,
