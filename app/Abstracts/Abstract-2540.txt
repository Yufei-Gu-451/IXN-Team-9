Until now, there is only one report that describes the use of small molecule fluorescent probes for hERG channels on the basis of dofetilide. NoneInspired by this strategy, we set out to apply this off/on mechanism for designing a fluorescent probe for the hERG channel (Scheme1A,B). None,NoneThe recognition moiety was incorporated with fluorophore through a Mannich reaction. As anticipated, fluorescence intensity was gradually enhanced with increased membrane concentrations (Figure1A,B). The experimental results demonstrated that no discernible fluorescence increase for trypsin was detected. Specifically, the selectivity of this probe for hERG-transfected HEK293 cell membrane is more than 2.5-fold over trypsin and the blank control and 1.5-fold over BSA (Figure2). In addition, the fluorescence enhancement of probes incubated with hERG-transfected HEK293 cell membranes can be obviously decreased (P less than 0.01) by a hERG inhibitor, astemizole. (A) Fluorescence polarization (FP) assay used to monitor the interaction between probe A1 (1 muM and 5 muM) and the cell membrane; (B) fluorescent polarization value changes with the increase of probe A1 concentration at 1.2 mg/mL cell membrane (lambdaem= 520 nm, lambdaex= 485 nm). In parallel, encouraged by the data described above, we further explored the feasibility of applying this probe to image hERG channels in living cells. However, there is few highly sensitive and selective small molecule fluorescent probes for ion channel detection.
