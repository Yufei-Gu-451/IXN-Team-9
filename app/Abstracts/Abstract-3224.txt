A Cochrane review of seven randomised trials (Between 1973 and 2009, 1065 older (?70 years) women (median age 78 years (70-99)) had either surgery (At 49-month median follow-up (longest 230 months), the 5-year breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) and OS were 90 and 62%, respectively. Majority (74.2%) died from causes other than breast cancer. The rates (per annum) of local/regional recurrence ( less than 1%) (following surgery), contralateral tumour ( less than 1%) and metastases ( less than 3%) were low. For patients on PET, 97.9% achieved clinical benefit (CB) at 6 months, with median time to progression of 49 months (longest 132 months) and significantly longer BCSS when compared with those who progressed (Older women with ER+ breast cancer appear to have excellent long-term outcome regardless of initial treatment. Majority also die from non-breast cancer causes. Although surgery remains the treatment of choice, patients with ER-rich (H-score greater than 250) tumours tend to do equally well when treated by PET. This should be taken into account when therapies are considered.
