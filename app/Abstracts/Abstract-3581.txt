We previously reported that chaetocin has potent and selective anti-myeloma activity attributable to reactive oxygen species (ROS) induction imposed by inhibition of the redox enzyme thioredoxin reductase; we now detail its effects in solid tumours. Cellular assays, transcriptional profiling and the NCI60 screen were used to assess the effects of chaetocin in solid tumour and endothelial cells. NCI-60 screening demonstrated chaetocin to even more potently inhibit proliferation in solid tumour than in haematological cell lines; transcriptional profiling revealed a signature consistent with induction of inflammatory response and cell death pathways. Chaetocin induced ROS, oxidative damage to cellular proteins and apoptosis, with 2-10 n ICChaetocin has intriguing and wide-ranging
