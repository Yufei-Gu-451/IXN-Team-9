Notch1 signaling sustains the proinflammatory behavior of Th1 cells, implicated in the development of aplastic anemia in humans and mice. Severe aplastic anemia (AA) is a bone marrow (BM) failure (BMF) disease frequently caused by aberrant immune destruction of blood progenitors. Although a Th1-mediated pathology is well described for AA, molecular mechanisms driving disease progression remain ill defined. The NOTCH signaling pathway mediates Th1 cell differentiation in the presence of polarizing cytokines, an action requiring enzymatic processing of NOTCH receptors by gamma-secretase. Using a mouse model of AA, we demonstrate that expression of both intracellular NOTCH1
