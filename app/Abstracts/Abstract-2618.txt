We have previously shown that daily subcutaneous injections with the naturally occurring phytoestrogen genistein (600 mg genistein/kg body weight/day, 600G) results in a significantly increased basal intestinal chloride, ClGiven the estrogen-like characteristics of genistein, we compared the effects of daily estradiol (E2) injections (10 mg E2/kg body weight/day, 10E2) on basal IWe measured total protein expression in isolated segments of jejunum using western blot from the following six groups of mice; intact or OVX with; 600G, 10E2 or control. The proteins of interest were: Akt, p-Akt, p-PDK1, p-PTEN, p-c-Raf, p-GSK-3beta, rap-1 and ERK1/2. All blots were normalized to GAPDH levels (n = 6-18/group). These data suggest that the presence of the endogenous sex steroid, estrogen, modifies the intracellular signaling pathway required to mediate Cl
