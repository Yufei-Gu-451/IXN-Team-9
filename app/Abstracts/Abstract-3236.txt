Intracranial meningeal hemangiopericytomas are rare tumors that can mimic meningioma on imaging and on histopathology. However, these tumors are more aggressive with a tendency for local and metastatic recurrence, sometimes after a prolonged symptom-free interval. We report an unusual metastatic recurrence of an intracranial hemangiopericytoma, 8 years after surgery for the primary tumor and discuss the role of positron emission tomography/computed tomography in the follow-up of these patients.
