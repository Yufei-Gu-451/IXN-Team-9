beta-Cell proliferation and expansion during pregnancy are crucial for maintaining euglycemia in response to increased metabolic demands placed on the mother. Prolactin and placental lactogen signal through the prolactin receptor (PRLR) and contribute to adaptive beta-cell responses in pregnancy; however, the in vivo requirement for PRLR signaling specifically in maternal beta-cell adaptations remains unknown. We generated a floxed allele of
