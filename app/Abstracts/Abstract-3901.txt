In adults, the shape of the glucose response during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) prospectively and independently predicts type 2 diabetes. However, no reports have described the utility of this indicator in younger populations. The purpose of this study was to compare type 2 diabetes risk factors in Latino adolescents characterized by either a monophasic or biphasic glucose response during an OGTT. A total of 156 nondiabetic Latino adolescents completed a 2-h OGTT. Monophasic and biphasic groups were compared for the following type 2 diabetes risk factors: fasting and 2-h glucose, HbAOf the participants, 107 youth were categorized as monophasic and 49 were biphasic. Compared with the monophasic group, participants with a biphasic response exhibited lower HbAThese data suggest that the glycemic response to an OGTT may differentiate risk for type 2 diabetes in youth. This response may be an early marker of type 2 diabetes risk among high-risk youth.
