Repair of various types of DNA damages is critical for genomic stability. DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) has an important role in DNA double-strand break repair. We examined whether there may be a correlation between DNA-PK activity in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) and survival percentages in various cancer patients. We also investigated the changes of DNA-PK activity in PBLs after radiotherapy. A total of 167 of untreated cancer patients participated in this study. Peripheral blood was collected, separated, and centrifuged. DNA-PK activity was measured by DNA-pull-down assay. Chromosomal aberrations were examined by cytogenetic methods. DNA-PK activity of PBLs in advanced cancer patients was significantly lower than that in early stage. The patients with lower DNA-PK activity in PBLs tended to have the lower disease-specific survivals and distant metastasis-free survivals than those with higher DNA-PK activity in advanced stages. There was also a tendency of inverse correlation between DNA-PK activity and excess fragments. The DNA-PK activity of PBLs in most patients decreased in response to radiation as the equivalent whole-body dose increased. Cancer patients in advanced stage, with lower DNA-PK activity of PBLs might have higher distant metastasis and exhibit poorer prognosis. Therefore, DNA-PK activity in PBLs could be used as a marker to predict the chromosomal instability and poorer prognosis.
