Little is known of the effect of body composition on glucose metabolism in the aging female non-human primate. We studied these variables in older female Rhesus macaques. Female Rhesus macaques (SF correlated with homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMADespite a greater amount of VF compared to SF, VF was not associated with markers of insulin resistance (IR) in the older female monkey. Instead, IHL is a marker for IR in the fasting and post-prandial state in these animals.
