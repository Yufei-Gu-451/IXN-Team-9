To assess whether intermittent real-time continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) improves glycemic control and pregnancy outcome in unselected women with pregestational diabetes. A total of 123 women with type 1 diabetes and 31 women with type 2 diabetes were randomized to use real-time CGM for 6 days at 8, 12, 21, 27, and 33 weeks in addition to routine care, including self-monitored plasma glucose seven times daily, or routine care only. To optimize glycemic control, real-time CGM readings were evaluated by a diabetes caregiver. HbAWomen assigned to real-time CGM (In this randomized trial, intermittent use of real-time CGM in pregnancy, in addition to self-monitored plasma glucose seven times daily, did not improve glycemic control or pregnancy outcome in women with pregestational diabetes.
