We evaluated whether the triglyceride-to-HDL cholesterol (TG/HDL-C) ratio is associated with insulin resistance (IR) in a large multiethnic cohort of obese youths. Obese youths (1,452) had an oral glucose tolerance test and a fasting lipid profile. Insulin sensitivity was estimated using the whole body insulin sensitivity index (WBISI) and homeostasis model assessment (HOMA)-IR and evaluated, in a subgroup of 146 obese youths, by the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. The cohort was divided by ethnicity (612 whites, 357 Hispanics, and 483 African Americans) and then stratified into ethnicity-specific tertiles of TG/HDL-C ratio. Differences across tertiles were evaluated, and the association between the TG/HDL-C ratio and insulin sensitivity (WBISI) was defined by a multiple stepwise linear regression analysis. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) was determined to calculate the TG/HDL-C ratio cutoff to identify insulin-resistant subjects by ethnicity. In each ethnic group and across rising tertiles of TG/HDL-C ratio, insulin sensitivity (WBISI) progressively decreased, whereas 2-h glucose and the AUC-glucose progressively increased. The cutoff for TG/HDL-C ratio was 2.27, and the odds of presenting with IR, in youths with TG/HDL-C ratio higher than the cutoff, was 6.023 (95% CI 2.798-12.964;The TG/HDL-C ratio is associated with IR mainly in white obese boys and girls and thus may be used with other risk factors to identify subjects at increased risk of IR-driven morbidity.
