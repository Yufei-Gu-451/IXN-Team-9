The oncogenic MUC1-C subunit is aberrantly overexpressed in most human breast cancers by mechanisms that are not well understood. The present studies demonstrate that stimulation of non-malignant MCF-10A cells with epidermal growth factor (EGF) or heregulin (HRG) results in marked upregulation of MUC1-C translation. Growth factor-induced MUC1-C translation was found to be mediated by PI3K- greater than AKT, and not MEK- greater than ERK1/2, signaling. We also show that activation of the mTORC1- greater than S6K1 pathway decreases PDCD4, an inhibitor of the eIF4A RNA helicase, and contributes to the induction of MUC1-C translation. In concert with these results, treatment of growth factor-stimulated MCF-10A cells with the eIF4A RNA helicase inhibitors, silvestrol and CR-1-31-B, blocked increases in MUC1-C abundance. The functional significance of the increase in MUC1-C translation is supported by the demonstration that MUC1-C, in turn, forms complexes with EGFR and promotes EGFR-mediated activation of the PI3K- greater than AKT pathway and the induction of growth. Compared to MCF-10A cells, constitutive overexpression of MUC1-C in breast cancer cells was unaffected by EGF stimulation, but was blocked by inhibiting PI3K- greater than AKT signaling. The overexpression of MUC1-C in breast cancer cells was also inhibited by blocking eIF4A RNA helicase activity with silvestrol and CR-1-31-B. These findings indicate that EGF-induced MUC1-C expression is mediated by the PI3K- greater than AKT pathway and the eIF4A RNA helicase, and that this response promotes EGFR signaling in an autoinductive loop. The findings also indicate that targeting the eIF4A RNA helicase is a novel approach for blocking MUC1-C overexpression in breast cancer cells.
