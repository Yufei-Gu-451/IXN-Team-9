This study investigated the predictive value of circulating microRNA-126 (cir-miRNA-126) in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) treated with first-line chemotherapy combined with bevacizumab. The study included 68 patients. Blood samples (plasma) were collected before the treatment initiation, at the first clinical evaluation after 3 weeks and at progression. Levels of cir-miRNA-126 were determined by qRT-PCR after purification of total RNA from plasma. Primary clinical end points were response rates evaluated according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours (RECIST) and progression-free survival (PFS). Changes in circulating miRNA-126 during treatment were predictive of tumour response. Non-responding patients had a median increase in cir-miRNA-126 of 0.244 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.050-0.565) compared with a median decrease of -0.374 (95% CI, -0.472 to -0.111) in the responding patients,The present results indicate that changes in cir-miRNA-126 during treatment are related to the response to chemotherapy and bevacizumab in patients with mCRC, thus representing a possible biomarker for the resistance to anti-angiogenic containing treatments.
