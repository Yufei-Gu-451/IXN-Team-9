To determine the concentrations of adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (AFABP) and other adipocytokines in maternal and cord serum of pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and of control subjects and to relate them to indexes of insulin sensitivity. In 86 control and 98 GDM pregnant women, venous blood was collected before vaginal delivery and arterial blood from cord immediately after delivery. Serum insulin and adipocytokines were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). GDM women had higher prepregnancy BMI, and data were adjusted for it. Maternal serum insulin, insulin-to-glucose ratio, homeostasis model assessment (HOMA), AFABP, and retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4) were higher and adiponectin was lower in GDM than in control subjects, whereas serum glucose, insulin, insulin-to-glucose ratio, HOMA, nonesterified fatty acids, and RBP4 were higher and glycerol, AFABP, and adiponectin were lower in cord blood serum of GDM than of control subjects. AFABP and adiponectin in cord serum of control subjects were higher than in maternal serum; in GDM women no difference was found for AFABP in cord versus maternal serum, although adiponectin remained higher in cord. Values of leptin in both groups were lower in cord than in maternal serum, and those of RBP4 were lower in only GDM women. It is suggested that fetal tissues are the main source of cord arterial serum AFABP, and in GDM fetuses AFABP values correlate with adiposity markers. A downregulation of adiponectin and upregulation of RBP4 in GDM mothers and their fetuses may be related to their insulin-resistant condition, whereas changes in AFABP do not seem to be related.
