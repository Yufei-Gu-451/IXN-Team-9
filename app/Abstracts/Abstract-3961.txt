Metastatic cell migration and invasion are regulated by altered adhesion-mediated signaling to the actin-based cytoskeleton via activated Src-FAK complexes. SSeCKS (the rodent orthologue of human Gravin/AKAP12), whose expression is downregulated by oncogenic Src and in many human cancers, antagonizes oncogenic Src pathways including those driving neovascularization at metastatic sites, metastatic cell motility and invasiveness. This is likely manifested through its function as a scaffolder of F-actin and signaling proteins such as cyclins, calmodulin, protein kinase (PK) C and PKA. Here, we show that in contrast to its ability to inhibit haptotaxis, SSeCKS increased prostate cancer cell adhesion to fibronectin (FN) and type I collagen in a FAK-dependent manner, correlating with a relative increase in FAK
