None,NoneTypes 3 and 4 IgG4-SC are difficult to differentiate from bile duct cancer, and hepatectomy has been reported sporadically in such situations. In addition, dilatation of the peripheral intrahepatic bile ducts was present. Abdominal ultrasonography showed thickening of the common bile duct wall, without swelling of the pancreas. The main pancreatic duct and the confluence of the bile duct and pancreatic duct showed no abnormalities. Right hepatectomy was planned. There was no palpable mass in the common bile duct, suggesting the absence of a malignancy. 3cand3d). However, cases of isolated biliary tract involvement without pancreatic lesions have also been reported. None-NoneTherefore it is necessary to differentiate types 3 and 4 IgG4-SC from cholangiocarcinoma, and thereby avoid unnecessary hepatectomy. None-NoneTo avoid delaying treatment in cases of cholangiocarcinoma, we generally have not conducted a steroid trial for IgG4-SC patients. Thus, steroid treatment after percutaneous transhepatic portal vein embolization may be useful in the diagnosis of bile duct stenosis that has value for hilar bile duct type of IgG4-SC, to estimate steroid effects.
