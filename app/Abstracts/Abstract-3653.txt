At diagnosis 10-25% of patients with colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) present as resectable disease. Liver resection is the gold standard treatment, resulting in a 5-year overall survival (OS) of 22-58%, local recurrence rates of 1.2-10.4% and a perioperative mortality of less than 5%. Multiple attempts have been made to assess the possible contribution of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) to improve OS and progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with unresectable colorectal liver metastases. The aim of this paper is to review the RFA literature in the setting of colorectal liver metastases: RFA with and without chemotherapy, RFA with and without resection, RFA for solitary unresectable CRLM, surgical and percutaneous imaging-guided RFA, RFA compared with chemotherapy. The reported OS, PFS, local recurrence rates, morbidity and mortality in these different settings are analyzed. This paper reflects on a possible role of RFA in resectable CRLM.
