In the Canadian Normoglycemia Outcome Evaluation (CANOE) trial, low-dose rosiglitazone/metformin reduced the risk of diabetes in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance by 66% over a median of 3.9 years. We evaluate the temporal changes in glycemic control, insulin sensitivity, and beta-cell function during this trial. CANOE participants (Glycemic parameters and insulin sensitivity improved in the rosiglitazone/metformin arm in year 1, but deteriorated in the years thereafter as in the placebo arm. Generalized estimating equation analysis confirmed that both insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function decreased over time (Matsuda: beta = -0.0515,Despite preventing incident diabetes, low-dose rosiglitazone/metformin did not modify the natural history of worsening insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction.
