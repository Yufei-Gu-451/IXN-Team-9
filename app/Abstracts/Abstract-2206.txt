Fractures of the mandible occur with a greater frequency in the elderly. This study reports three cases of edentulous atrophic mandible fracture in elderly patients treated with open reduction technique. Three patients who presented with edentulous atrophic mandible fractures underwent surgical management using open reduction and internal fixation. After treatment, clinical evaluations and postoperative complications were examined with postoperative x-ray. Patients were followed with clinical and radiographic examinations. In the postoperative clinical evaluation, two male patients healed well, but one female patient complained of pain and swelling. In radiographic examinations, no union delay or lack of fusion was observed in the edentulous area. Open reduction technique is a viable treatment option for the edentulous atrophic mandible fractures in geriatric patients.
