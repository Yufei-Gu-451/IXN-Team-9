Extracranial application of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has gained increasing importance in recent years. As a result of technical advances, this new non-invasive functional technique has also been applied in head and neck radiology for several clinical indications. In cancer imaging, diffusion-weighted MRI can be performed for tumour detection and characterization, monitoring of treatment response as well as the differentiation of recurrence and post-therapeutic changes after radiotherapy. Even for lymph node staging promising results have been reported recently. This review article provides overview of potential applications of diffusion-weighted MRI in head and neck with the main focus on its applications in oncology.
