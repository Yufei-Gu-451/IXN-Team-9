In behavioral studies of weight loss programs, participants typically receive interventions free of charge. Understanding an individuals' willingness to pay for weight loss programs could be helpful when evaluating potential funding models. To assess willingness to pay for the continuation of a weight loss program at the end of a weight loss study. We assessed willingness to pay for the continuation of a weight loss program with monthly coaching contacts at the end of the two year Hopkins POWER trial. Interview administered questionnaires determined the amount participants were willing to pay for continued intervention. Estimated maximum payment was calculated among those willing to pay and was based on quantile regression adjusted for age, body mass index, race, sex, household income, treatment condition, and weight change at 24 months. Among the participants (N=234), 95% were willing to pay for continued weight loss intervention; the adjusted median payment was $45 per month. Blacks had a higher adjusted median willingness to pay ($65/month) compared to Non-Blacks ($45/month), p=.021. A majority of participants were willing to pay for a continued weight loss intervention with a median monthly amount that was similar to the cost of commercial weight loss programs.
