As with many drugs, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are reported to prolong the QT interval (StrevelNone, 2007;BelloNone, 2009;LeeNone, 2010;TolcherNone, 2011;DoganNone, 2012;DohertyNone, 2013;DongNone, 2013;HeathNone, 2013;ShahNone, 2013). In three prospective post-marketing studies in patients with solid tumours treated with sorafenib (N=31), pazopanib (N=48), and sunitinib (N=24) a modest increase of 9.0 ms of QTc interval with the use of sorafenib, 4.4 ms after start of pazopanib and 9.6 ms after start of sunitinib was seen (BelloNone, 2009;TolcherNone, 2011;HeathNone, 2013). Patients from four centres in the Netherlands (Erasmus MC Cancer Institute, Rotterdam, Leiden University Medical Centre, Leiden, and Netherlands Cancer Institute-Antoni van Leeuwenhoek, Amsterdam) and Italy (Salvatore Maugeri Foundation, Pavia) were included. Exclusion criteria were as follows: ECGs that do not match criteria for accurate QTc-interval measurements (intra-ventricular conduction delay and/or pacemaker driven rhythm), missing ECGs at baseline or during therapy, and patients with a time-lapse between baseline ECG and start of TKI treatment of more than 1 year. The QTc was also categorised according to theCommon terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE) guidelines version 4.03(grade 0, QTc less than 450; grade 1, QTc 450-479 ms; grade 2, QTc 480-499 ms; grade 3, QTc?500 ms; grade 4, QTc?500 ms with life-threatening signs or symptoms; grade 5, death). , from QTc less than 470 to QTc?470 ms) (KobzaNone, 2009;TrinkleyNone, 2013), (iii) clinically relevant DeltaQTc (defined as DeltaQTc?30 ms, above which the risk for TdP is significantly increased) (LiNone, 2010) and (iv) QTc-interval CTCAE grade increase during TKI therapy. In 262 patients, the time lapse between baseline ECG and start of treatment was more than 1 year and patients were therefore excluded from the analysis. The median QTc interval at baseline visit was 401 ms (IQR 388-415), where 346 patients (95.3%) had a normal QTc interval (CTCAE grade 0), 14 (3.9%) had grade 1, 2 patients (0.6%) had grade 2, and 1 patient (0.3%) had a grade 3 QTc interval. At baseline measurements, QTc was slightly, but significantly greater in females than in males (QTcfemales=404 ms (IQR 392-417)vsQTcmales=399 ms (IQR 385-414),P=0.027), which is consistent with previous studies (StrevelNone, 2007). Patients treated with co-medication known to prolong the QTc interval, such as anti-depressants, anti-epileptics, and anti-emetics, had a statistically significant higher baseline QTc interval than the patients who did not use such co-medication (409 ms (IQR 398-424)vs400 ms (IQR 387-414), respectively,P=0.035). Consistent with previous studies, patients suffering from hypokalaemia had longer median QTc intervals than patients with normokalaemia and hyperkalaemia (median QTc in hypokalaemic, normokalaemic, and hyperkalaemic patients 416 ms (IQR 376-431), 401 ms (IQR 389-415), and 391 ms (IQR 381-408),P=0.028, respectively). When analysing subgroups of patients treated with specific TKIs, patients treated with sunitinib (N=110), vemurafenib (N=67), sorafenib (N=52), imatinib (N=41), and erlotinib (N=21) showed a statistically significant increase in QTc interval after start of treatment (median DeltaQTc ranging from +7 to +24 ms,0.004;Figure 1). All five patients who developed QTc?500 ms after start of therapy had a DeltaQTc of ?100 ms. When focusing on specific TKI subgroups, we observed that individuals treated with vemurafenib (N=67) were characterised by a statistically significant increase both in terms of CTCAE grade for QTc intervals (P=0.008) and in the probability of becoming high-risk patients (P=0.023), also showing the greatest probability of clinically relevant QTc increase (34.3%). The median age of patients who had a worsening of the CTCAE grade for QTc interval was significantly higher than that of patients who did not (62 years (IQR 59-72)vs60 years (IQR 51-67), respectively,P=0.023). Multivariate logistic regression confirmed that age and hypokalaemia were independent predictors of worsened CTCAE grade for QTc interval (OR=1.10, 95% CI=1.05-1.16,P=0.0002 and OR=10.30, 95% CI=2.22-4.64,P=0.002). Similarly, patients who had QTc prolongation to ?470 ms after start of TKI treatment were significantly older than patients who did not (66 years (IQR 60-76) and 60 years (IQR 51-66), respectively,P=0.007) and were more frequently treated with QTc-prolonging co-medication (25%vs8.5%,P=0.030). However, in 76 of the 363 patients the start of TKI treatment resulted in a clinically relevant increase of the QTc interval of ?30 ms. Still, only the subgroup receiving vemurafenib showed a statistically significant increase in the number of patients with QTc greater than 470 ms. In the entire cohort, 21% of patients showed a clinically relevant increase in QTc of ?30 ms with TKI treatment, but as most had a normal baseline QTc interval, only 5% had a QTc of ?470 ms, which is associated with increased risk of arrhythmias. In those diseases where alternative treatment is available, such as in metastatic renal cell carcinoma where sunitinib and pazopanib have equivalent efficacy (MotzerNone, 2013), consideration should be given to use a TKI with less QTc prolongation effects if the QTc is prolonged at baseline or develops during treatment. This was shown in this study, where 14 patients (4%) using such co-medication were more likely to develop QTc prolongation. In those cases, extra awareness may be necessary and switching to drugs that are not likely to have an effect on QTc interval should be considered. In some cases, this increase is clinically relevant, and therefore the QTc interval should be verified in patients before starting TKI treatment and during therapy. Furthermore, during treatment with TKIs physicians should be aware of clinical symptoms, which may be attributed to QTc-interval prolongation.
