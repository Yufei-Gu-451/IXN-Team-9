The QT interval represents the total duration of ventricular depolarisation and repolarisation. Prolongation of the QT interval usually results from delayed repolarisation. The QT interval is usually corrected for heart rate, leading to the corrected QT interval QTc. As with many drugs, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are reported to prolong the QT interval (StrevelNone, 2007;BelloNone, 2009;LeeNone, 2010;TolcherNone, 2011;DoganNone, 2012;DohertyNone, 2013;DongNone, 2013;HeathNone, 2013;ShahNone, 2013). This results in a reduction of the repolarising current (IKr), which can lead to action potential prolongation and subsequent QT-interval prolongation (LeeNone, 2010;DongNone, 2013). The QT interval was measured from the beginning of the QRS complex until the point where the deflection of the T wave crosses the iso-electric line. Since increases in heart rate result in shortening of the QT interval, a correction for heart rate was applied using the Bazett formula (SagieNone, 1992):NoneIn this formula, RR is the interval between two subsequent R waves. Outcome measures used in this study were (i) the quantitative difference in QTc interval between on therapy and baseline ECG measurements (DeltaQTc, ms), (ii) the transition from a condition of normal repolarisation to a condition in which QTc is prolonged to an extent with high risk of arrhythmia as a consequence of the TKI therapy (i.e. All five patients who developed QTc?500 ms after start of therapy had a DeltaQTc of ?100 ms. Still, only the subgroup receiving vemurafenib showed a statistically significant increase in the number of patients with QTc greater than 470 ms. As drugs of a broad variety are known for drug-induced QTc-interval prolongation, it is likely that patients use several drugs which can lead to QTc-interval prolongation and thereby intensifying the effect on the QTc interval. Future prospective studies could improve the current knowledge about TKI-induced QTc prolongation.
