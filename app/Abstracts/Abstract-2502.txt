Prolongation of the QT interval usually results from delayed repolarisation. A total number of 37 patients (10.2%) had a known history of relevant CVD, while 34 patients (9.4%) used co-medication, that can lead to QTc-interval prolongation (StrevelNone, 2007). Patients treated with co-medication known to prolong the QTc interval, such as anti-depressants, anti-epileptics, and anti-emetics, had a statistically significant higher baseline QTc interval than the patients who did not use such co-medication (409 ms (IQR 398-424)vs400 ms (IQR 387-414), respectively,P=0.035). Moreover, 5 patients (1.4%) developed QTc?500 ms (CTCAE grade 3) after therapy start, and 76 patients (20.9%) experienced a clinically relevant QTc increase after TKI start. Similarly, patients who had QTc prolongation to ?470 ms after start of TKI treatment were significantly older than patients who did not (66 years (IQR 60-76) and 60 years (IQR 51-66), respectively,P=0.007) and were more frequently treated with QTc-prolonging co-medication (25%vs8.5%,P=0.030). However, in 76 of the 363 patients the start of TKI treatment resulted in a clinically relevant increase of the QTc interval of ?30 ms. Still, only the subgroup receiving vemurafenib showed a statistically significant increase in the number of patients with QTc greater than 470 ms. Although older patients, patients with low potassium and patients taking co-medication which can prolong the QTc interval are at higher risk of QTc-interval prolongation, it is still not possible to differentiate which patient is at risk at the start of treatment. Possible effects from electrolyte disorders on the QTc interval may have been missed, because of missing data. Future prospective studies could improve the current knowledge about TKI-induced QTc prolongation. Overall, we may conclude that most TKIs tend to cause an increase in QTc intervals. In some cases, this increase is clinically relevant, and therefore the QTc interval should be verified in patients before starting TKI treatment and during therapy.
