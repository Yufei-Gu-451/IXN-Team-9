Overall, we may conclude that most TKIs tend to cause an increase in QTc intervals. In some cases, this increase is clinically relevant, and therefore the QTc interval should be verified in patients before starting TKI treatment and during therapy. Monitoring QTc intervals during TKI treatment is particularly important in patients with a history of QTc-interval prolongation, in patients using co-medication which can prolong the QTc interval, in patients with electrolyte disorders, and in patients with pre-existing CVD. Furthermore, during treatment with TKIs physicians should be aware of clinical symptoms, which may be attributed to QTc-interval prolongation.
