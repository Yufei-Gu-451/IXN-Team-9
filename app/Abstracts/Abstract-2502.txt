In the entire population of 363 patients, the start of a TKI resulted in a statistically significant increase in QTc interval, with a median DeltaQTc of +11 ms (0.00001). The distribution of DeltaQTc was significantly different across TKIs (P=0.0001). A statistically significant increase in CTCAE grade for QTc intervals was observed after start of TKI therapy in the whole cohort (P=0.0003). Of the remaining patients, 321 (88.4%) did not have an increase or decrease in CTCAE grade after start of TKI treatment, while 9 patients (2.5%) had a reduced CTCAE grade for QTc interval (Table 3). When focusing on specific TKI subgroups, we observed that individuals treated with vemurafenib (N=67) were characterised by a statistically significant increase both in terms of CTCAE grade for QTc intervals (P=0.008) and in the probability of becoming high-risk patients (P=0.023), also showing the greatest probability of clinically relevant QTc increase (34.3%). Still, only the subgroup receiving vemurafenib showed a statistically significant increase in the number of patients with QTc greater than 470 ms. Although older patients, patients with low potassium and patients taking co-medication which can prolong the QTc interval are at higher risk of QTc-interval prolongation, it is still not possible to differentiate which patient is at risk at the start of treatment. As drugs of a broad variety are known for drug-induced QTc-interval prolongation, it is likely that patients use several drugs which can lead to QTc-interval prolongation and thereby intensifying the effect on the QTc interval. Monitoring QTc intervals during TKI treatment is particularly important in patients with a history of QTc-interval prolongation, in patients using co-medication which can prolong the QTc interval, in patients with electrolyte disorders, and in patients with pre-existing CVD.
