The QT interval represents the total duration of ventricular depolarisation and repolarisation. Prolongation of the QT interval usually results from delayed repolarisation. The QT interval is usually corrected for heart rate, leading to the corrected QT interval QTc. Several factors such as gender, age, electrolyte disturbances, cardiovascular diseases (CVD), and different types of drugs can affect the duration of the QT interval (YetkinNone, 2001;BenoitNone, 2005). However, for new anticancer drugs these studies are usually not performed in healthy individuals because of their toxicity profile (CuriglianoNone, 2008;de Jonge and Verweij, 2008). As with many drugs, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are reported to prolong the QT interval (StrevelNone, 2007;BelloNone, 2009;LeeNone, 2010;TolcherNone, 2011;DoganNone, 2012;DohertyNone, 2013;DongNone, 2013;HeathNone, 2013;ShahNone, 2013). This results in a reduction of the repolarising current (IKr), which can lead to action potential prolongation and subsequent QT-interval prolongation (LeeNone, 2010;DongNone, 2013). In this multicentre study performed in four centres in the Netherlands and Italy, we describe the incidence and relevance of QTc-interval prolongation in patients with cancer treated with different types of TKIs. Since increases in heart rate result in shortening of the QT interval, a correction for heart rate was applied using the Bazett formula (SagieNone, 1992):NoneIn this formula, RR is the interval between two subsequent R waves. Outcome measures used in this study were (i) the quantitative difference in QTc interval between on therapy and baseline ECG measurements (DeltaQTc, ms), (ii) the transition from a condition of normal repolarisation to a condition in which QTc is prolonged to an extent with high risk of arrhythmia as a consequence of the TKI therapy (i.e. Moreover, 5 patients (1.4%) developed QTc?500 ms (CTCAE grade 3) after therapy start, and 76 patients (20.9%) experienced a clinically relevant QTc increase after TKI start. Future prospective studies could improve the current knowledge about TKI-induced QTc prolongation.
