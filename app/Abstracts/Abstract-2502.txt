The QTc was also categorised according to theCommon terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE) guidelines version 4.03(grade 0, QTc less than 450; grade 1, QTc 450-479 ms; grade 2, QTc 480-499 ms; grade 3, QTc?500 ms; grade 4, QTc?500 ms with life-threatening signs or symptoms; grade 5, death). In 262 patients, the time lapse between baseline ECG and start of treatment was more than 1 year and patients were therefore excluded from the analysis. At baseline measurements, QTc was slightly, but significantly greater in females than in males (QTcfemales=404 ms (IQR 392-417)vsQTcmales=399 ms (IQR 385-414),P=0.027), which is consistent with previous studies (StrevelNone, 2007). When analysing subgroups of patients treated with specific TKIs, patients treated with sunitinib (N=110), vemurafenib (N=67), sorafenib (N=52), imatinib (N=41), and erlotinib (N=21) showed a statistically significant increase in QTc interval after start of treatment (median DeltaQTc ranging from +7 to +24 ms,0.004;Figure 1). A statistically significant increase in CTCAE grade for QTc intervals was observed after start of TKI therapy in the whole cohort (P=0.0003). Similarly, a statistically significant increase in the prevalence of high-risk patients was observed after TKI therapy start (QTcbaseline?470 ms=1.7%vsQTctherapy?470 ms=5.8%,P=0.005), with 20 individuals (5.5%) who transitioned from a low-risk to a high-risk condition. However, in 76 of the 363 patients the start of TKI treatment resulted in a clinically relevant increase of the QTc interval of ?30 ms. The incidence of high-risk patients, defined as QTc?470 ms (TrinkleyNone, 2013), increased during treatment with a TKI. Still, only the subgroup receiving vemurafenib showed a statistically significant increase in the number of patients with QTc greater than 470 ms. This was shown in this study, where 14 patients (4%) using such co-medication were more likely to develop QTc prolongation. Also, only patients treated with a TKI were included and there was no control group given non-TKI treatment in which the variation in the QTc interval could be examined. In some cases, this increase is clinically relevant, and therefore the QTc interval should be verified in patients before starting TKI treatment and during therapy. Furthermore, during treatment with TKIs physicians should be aware of clinical symptoms, which may be attributed to QTc-interval prolongation.
