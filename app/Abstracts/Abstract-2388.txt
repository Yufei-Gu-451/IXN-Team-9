Macrophages are early islet-infiltrating cells seen in type 1 diabetes (T1D). While proinflammatory M1 macrophages induce T1D, M2 macrophages have been shown to delay this autoimmune disease in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice, but the environmental cues that govern macrophage polarization and differentiation remain unresolved. We previously demonstrated the importance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in T1D, as NOD mice deficient in NADPH oxidase (NOX)-derived superoxide (
