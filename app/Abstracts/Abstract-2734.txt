There is now a growing body of evidence supporting the use of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) in gynaecological malignancies. Although this molecular imaging technique is becoming increasingly available, PET/CT remains an expensive imaging tool. It is essential to be familiar with the circumstances in which FDG-PET/CT can add value and contribute to patient management and indeed to know when it is unlikely to be of benefit. It is also important to understand and recognize the potential pitfalls. FDG-PET/CT has been most widely adopted for staging patients with suspected advanced disease or in suspected recurrence, offering a whole-body imaging approach. However, there is great potential for this technique to act as a predictive biomarker of response to treatment, as well as a prognostic biomarker. In addition, FDG-PET images may now be incorporated into radiotherapy planning in order to refine the delineation of dose according to metabolically active sites of disease. This article reviews the literature that provides the evidence for the use of FDG-PET in gynaecological malignancies, identifies areas of real benefit and future potential, and highlights circumstances where there is limited value.
