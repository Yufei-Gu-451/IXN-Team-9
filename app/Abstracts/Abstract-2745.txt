Masses can involve the kidney unilaterally or bilaterally. The purpose of this article is to review common and uncommon adult renal masses that present bilaterally. Clinical and imaging findings are described. Renal masses that present in a bilateral fashion can have particular clinical and imaging characteristics and knowledge of their presentation enables appropriate diagnosis and management, especially in a multidisciplinary care setting. More commonly found bilateral renal masses that are discussed include metastasis, lymphoproliferative disorders, adult polycystic kidney disease, angiomyolipomas, renal infracts and renal abscesses. Less common bilateral renal masses include transitional cell carcinoma, oncocytoma, and hematomas.
