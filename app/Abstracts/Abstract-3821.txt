Nucleofection permits efficient transfection even with difficult cell types such as primary and non-dividing cells, and is used to deliver various nucleic acids including DNA, mRNA, and siRNA. Unlike DNA and siRNA, mRNA is subject to rapid degradation, which necessitates instant early translation following mRNA delivery. We examined factors important in translation following nucleofection and observed rapid phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2alpha) following nucleofection, which occurred in the absence of delivered nucleic acid. We studied the involvement of 3 ubiquitous kinases capable of phosphorylating eIF2alpha in mammalian cells and identified that nucleofection-mediated phosphorylation of eIF2alpha was dependent on general control non-derepressible 2 (GCN2) and protein kinase RNA-activated (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK) but not PKR. A reduction in translation due to eIF2alpha phosphorylation was observed post nucleofection demonstrating functional significance. Understanding the impact of nucleofection on translational machinery has important implications for therapeutics currently under development based on the delivery of mRNA, DNA, and siRNA. Strategies to circumvent eIF2alpha phosphorylation and other downstream effects of activating GCN2 and PERK will facilitate further advancement of nucleic acid-based therapies.
