The angiotensin (ANG)-(1-7)/Mas receptor (MasR) pathway activates vascular repair-relevant functions of bone marrow progenitor cells. We tested the effects of ANG-(1-7) on mobilization and vasoreparative functions of progenitor cells that are impaired in diabetes. The study was performed in streptozotocin-induced diabetic (
