Immune intervention trials in recent-onset type 1 diabetes would benefit from biomarkers associated with good therapeutic response. In the previously reported randomized placebo-controlled anti-CD3 study (otelixizumab; GlaxoSmithKline), we tested the hypothesis that specific diabetes autoantibodies might serve this purpose. In the included patients (At baseline, only better preserved AUC C-peptide release and higher levels of IAA were associated with better preservation of beta-cell function and lower insulin needs under anti-CD3 treatment. In multivariate analysis, IAA (There is important specificity of IAA among other diabetes autoantibodies to predict good therapeutic response of recent-onset type 1 diabetic patients to anti-CD3 treatment. If confirmed, future immune intervention trials in type 1 diabetes should consider both relatively preserved functional beta-cell mass and presence of IAA as inclusion criteria.
