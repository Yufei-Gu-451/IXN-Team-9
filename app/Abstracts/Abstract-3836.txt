The omega-hydroxylase CYP4A11 catalyzes the transformation of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids to omega-hydroxylated-epoxyeicosatrienoic acids, endogenous peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) agonists. PPARalpha activation increases high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C). A cytosine-for-thymidine (T8590C) variant of
