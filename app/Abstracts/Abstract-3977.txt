MicroRNAs have been implicated as important mediators of cancer cell homeostasis, and accumulating data suggest compelling roles for them in the apoptosis pathway. X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) is a potent caspase inhibitor and an important barrier to apoptotic cell death, but the mechanisms which determine the diverse range of XIAP expression seen in cancer remains unclear. In this study, we present evidence that miR-24 directly targets the 3'UTR of the XIAP mRNA to exert translational repression. Using a heuristic algorithm of bioinformatics analysis and
