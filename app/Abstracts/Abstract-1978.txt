Loss of CCM1/2 leads to destabilization of ICAP-1 and up-regulation of beta1 integrin, resulting in the destabilization of intercellular junctions due to increased cell contractility and aberrant extracellular matrix remodeling. The endothelial CCM complex regulates blood vessel stability and permeability. Loss-of-function mutations in CCM genes are responsible for human cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs), which are characterized by clusters of hemorrhagic dilated capillaries composed of endothelium lacking mural cells and altered sub-endothelial extracellular matrix (ECM). Association of the CCM1/2 complex with ICAP-1, an inhibitor of beta1 integrin, prompted us to investigate whether the CCM complex interferes with integrin signaling. We demonstrate that CCM1/2 loss resulted in ICAP-1 destabilization, which increased beta1 integrin activation and led to increased RhoA-dependent contractility. The resulting abnormal distribution of forces led to aberrant ECM remodeling around lesions of CCM1- and CCM2-deficient mice. ICAP-1-deficient vessels displayed similar defects. We demonstrate that a positive feedback loop between the aberrant ECM and internal cellular tension led to decreased endothelial barrier function. Our data support that up-regulation of beta1 integrin activation participates in the progression of CCM lesions by destabilizing intercellular junctions through increased cell contractility and aberrant ECM remodeling.
