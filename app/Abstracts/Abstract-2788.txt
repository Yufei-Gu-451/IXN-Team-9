Correct staging of non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is vital for appropriate management. Initial staging is usually performed with computerised tomography (CT), but increasingly functional imaging using integrated positron emission tomography and CT (PET/CT) is being used to provide more accurate staging, guide biopsies, assess response to therapy and identify recurrent disease.
