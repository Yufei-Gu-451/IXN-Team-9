The inner ear contains sensory epithelia that detect head movements, gravity and sound. It is unclear how to derive these sensory epithelia from pluripotent stem cells, a process which will be critical for modeling inner ear disorders or developing cell-based therapies for profound hearing loss and balance disorders
