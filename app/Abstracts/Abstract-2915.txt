Psychotherapy process research examines the content of treatment sessions and their association with outcomes in an attempt to better understand the interactions between therapists and clients, and to elucidate mechanisms of behavior change. A similar approach is possible in technology-delivered interventions, which have an interaction process that is always perfectly preserved and rigorously definable. The present study sought to examine the process of participants' interactions with a computer-delivered brief intervention for drug use, from a study comparing computer- and therapist-delivered brief interventions among adults at two primary health care centers in New Mexico. Specifically, we sought to describe the pattern of participants' (Process variables in eHealth interventions-such as choices made during an interactive intervention-are readily available. Such variables can provide insight into how participants use eHealth interventions. Correlations between choices and outcomes may also guide intervention optimization and future research. Among screen-positive adults in primary care, 108 (60.7%) denied any problems as a result of their drug use. Participant ratings of the importance of change were unrelated to changes in substance use frequency.
