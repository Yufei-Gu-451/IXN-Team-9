NEDD9 is an established marker of invasive and metastatic cancers. NEDD9 downregulation has been shown to dramatically reduce cell invasion and metastasis in multiple tumors. The mechanisms by which NEDD9 regulates invasion are largely unknown. In the current study, we have found that NEDD9 is required for MMP14 enzymatic recovery/recycling through the late endosomes to enable disengagement of tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (TIMP2) and tumor invasion. Depletion of NEDD9 decreases targeting of the MMP14/TIMP2 complex to late endosomes and increases trafficking of MMP14 from early/sorting endosomes back to the surface in a small GTPase Arf6-dependent manner. NEDD9 directly binds to Arf6-GAP, ARAP3, and Arf6 effector GGA3 thereby facilitating the Arf6 inactivation required for MMP14/TIMP2 targeting to late endosomes. Re-expression of NEDD9 or a decrease in Arf6 activity is sufficient to restore MMP14 activity and the invasive properties of tumor cells. Importantly, NEDD9 inhibition by Vivo-Morpholinos, an antisense therapy, decreases primary tumor growth and metastasis in xenograft models of breast cancer. Collectively, our findings uncover a novel mechanism to control tumor cells dissemination through NEDD9/Arf6-dependent regulation of MMP14/TIMP2 trafficking, and validates NEDD9 as a clinically relevant therapeutic target to treat metastatic cancer.
