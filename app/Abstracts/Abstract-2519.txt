Genetic ablation of NEDD9 expression in an MMTV-HER2-driven transgenic model of mammary tumorigenesis led to a 90% decrease in the incidence of cancer (6). Activation of soluble MMPs is triggered by membrane bound MMPs such as MMP14. Activity of MMP14 on the cell surface is regulated by multiple mechanisms, including binding of tissue specific inhibitor of MMP (TIMP2) and endocytosis. It is currently unknown whether TIMP2 follows the similar pattern of recycling and degradation. We have previously reported that depletion of NEDD9 leads to a decrease in MMP14 activity and an accumulation of the MMP14/TIMP2 complex on cell surface. The increase in MMP14 on the cell surface is often due to the deficiency in internalization, which is necessary for proper enzyme function (22,23). Interestingly, the amount of recycled MMP14, as indicated by co-staining with both anti-MMP14 antibodies, was increased up to 40% in the shNEDD9 cells (Fig.3a-c). Surprisingly, the amount of MMP14 protein in shNEDD9 cells was 20% higher than in the control (Fig.S2a-b), suggesting that a decrease in NEDD9 leads to a decrease in the degradation of MMP14. Surprisingly, overexpression of NEDD9 led to a decrease in Arf6 activity (Fig.S4a), while the knockdown of NEDD9 resulted in approximately a two-fold increase in Arf6 (Fig.5a-b) activity. We also noticed a moderate decrease in the total amount of the Arf6 protein in cells with constitutive knockdown of NEDD9 (Fig.5a-b). We found that NEDD9 specifically binds to ARAP3 (Fig.6a). Treatment of the shNEDD9 cells with SecinH3 or re-expression of wtNEDD9 (10) rescued the phenotype leading to a decrease in the amount of PM-MMP14 (Fig.6g). Previously, our group reported an accumulation of an endogenous MMP inhibitor, TIMP2, on the surface of the NEDD9 deficient cells as a potential mechanism for MMP14 inactivation upon depletion of NEDD9 (10). As we previously indicated, NEDD9 depletion leads to a decrease in activation of MMP2 and MMP9, thus affecting the ability of cancer cells to invade (43). Therefore, we decided to check whether NEDD9 regulates MMP14 recycling through small GTPases. Surprisingly, NEDD9, was involved in inactivation of Arf6-GTPase. Arf6 regulates key aspects of endocytic recycling (46), (47). Moreover, in the case of NEDD9 depletion, there is no overexpression of Arf6 protein, but rather a decrease, indicating the existence of a potential feedback loop to reduce the activity of Arf6 via a decrease in protein stability or expression. Previously MMP14 was reported to be recycled through a Rab8 dependent mechanism (55). Ablation of the MMP14 gene causes severe developmental defects (57), suggesting that the activity of MMP14 cannot be substituted by any other MMP. Attempts at developing selective MMP14 small molecule inhibitors have been so far unsuccessful (58).
