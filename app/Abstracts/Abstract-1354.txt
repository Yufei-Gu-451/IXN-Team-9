Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) has a very aggressive clinical course with early metastasis. This study investigated how the distinctive neuroendocrine characteristics contribute to disease progression and invasion in human SCLC. The neuroendocrine phenotype (pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC)) was quantified by ELISA in blood samples from 43 SCLC patients. The neuroendocrine (POMC, chromogranin A, neuron-specific enolase, NCAM) and epithelial (cytokeratin and E-cadherin) phenotypes were investigated, using ELISA and immunocytochemistry/immunohistochemistry. In SCLC patients, 16% had elevated circulating POMC, which was associated with significantly worse survival (Both neuroendocrine and epithelial phenotypes coexist in human SCLC tumours
