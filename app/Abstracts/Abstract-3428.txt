The evaluation of treatment response is an established role for imaging in oncologic research and clinical practice. In early phase trials, imaging response criteria are used to determine the presence and magnitude of the drug effect on tumour to aid decisions concerning progress to late phase trials, and to inform dose selection and scheduling. In late phase trials and clinical practice, the imaging response is used as a surrogate for clinical outcome. Due to the limitations of current anatomic response criteria, there is growing interest in the use of [
