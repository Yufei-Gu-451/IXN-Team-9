The entities included in the highly aggressive group are Burkitt lymphoma and lymphoblastic lymphoma. In the literature, peritoneal lymphomatosis is most commonly reported in association with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma[None]. (B) Reformatted coronal fused PET/CT images show intense FDG uptake in retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy (asterisk) and omental masses (arrows). (A) Axial contrast-enhanced CT image shows multiple small peritoneal nodules and a smudged appearance caused by the infiltrated adjacent omental fat. (B) Axial contrast-enhanced CT image shows additional retroperitoneal enlarged lymph nodes (asterisk) and lymphomatous involvement of the spleen (arrow). A focal area of FDG uptake in the spleen is consistent with lymphoma involvement (arrow, D) and was not seen in the contrast-enhanced CT (A). Peritoneal lymphomatosis can be seen as an initial presentation of lymphoma (Fig. In peritoneal lymphomatosis, FDG-PET/CT not only has greater sensitivity than CT for depicting peritoneal involvement in subtle cases but it also has greater accuracy in identifying extranodal sites other than the peritoneum, even in the absence of CT findings (Fig. There are 2 distinct patterns of glucose metabolism on FDG-PET/CT in peritoneal lymphomatosis: a nodular (Figs. The FDG avidity in lymphoma is variable. 10), in addition to a diffuse distribution of enlarged lymph nodes, are helpful signs of peritoneal lymphomatosis[None]. In peritoneal carcinomatosis, lymphadenopathy is usually located around the primary tumor[None]. Although bulky masses are also usually seen in peritoneal sarcomatosis, they are frequently heterogeneous, hypervascular and may be associated with hemoperitoneum (Fig. Axial contrast-enhanced CT images (A, B) show bulky heterogeneous masses within the greater omentum (asterisks, A, B) with no associated ascites or enlarged lymph nodes.
