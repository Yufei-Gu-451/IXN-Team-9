Postprandial lipemia worsens after menopause, but the mechanism remains unknown. We hypothesized menopause-related postprandial lipemia would be: 1) associated with reduced storage of dietary fatty acids (FA) as triglyceride (TG) in subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT); and 2) improved by short-term estradiol (EWe studied 23 pre- (mean+/-SD; 42+/-4yr) and 22 postmenopausal (55+/-4yr) women with similar total adiposity. A subset of postmenopausal women (n=12) were studied following 2 weeks of EA liquid meal containingCompared to premenopausal, healthy lean postmenopausal women had increased postprandial glucose and insulin and trend for higher TG, but similar dietary FA oxidation and storage. Adipocytes were larger in post- compared to premenopausal women, particularly in femoral SAT. Short-term EShort-term E
