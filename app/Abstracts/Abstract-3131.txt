The liver extracellular matrix (ECM) expands with high-fat (HF) feeding. This finding led us to address whether receptors for the ECM, integrins, are key to the development of diet-induced hepatic insulin resistance. Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is a downstream integrin signaling molecule involved in multiple hepatic processes, including those related to differentiation, wound healing, and metabolism. We tested the hypothesis that deletion of ILK in mice on an HF diet would disrupt the ECM-integrin signaling axis, thereby preventing the transformation into the insulin-resistant liver. To determine the role of ILK in hepatic insulin action in vivo, male C57BL/6J ILK
