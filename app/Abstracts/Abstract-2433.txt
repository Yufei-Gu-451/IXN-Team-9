Cell competition where 'loser' cells are eliminated by neighbors with higher fitness is a widespread phenomenon in development. However, a growing body of evidence argues cells with somatic mutations compete with their wild type counterparts in the earliest stages of cancer development. Recent studies have begun to shed light on the molecular and cellular mechanisms that alter the competitiveness of cells carrying somatic mutations in adult tissues. Cells with a 'winner' phenotype create clones which may expand into extensive fields of mutant cells within normal appearing epithelium, favoring the accumulation of further genetic alterations and the evolution of cancer. Here we focus on how mutations which disrupt the Notch signaling pathway confer a 'super competitor' status on cells in squamous epithelia and consider the broader implications for cancer evolution.
