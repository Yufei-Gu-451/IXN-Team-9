Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) contribute to tumor-mediated immune escape and negatively correlate with overall survival of cancer patients. Nowadays, a variety of methods to target MDSCs are being investigated. Based on the intervention stage of MDSCs, namely development, expansion and activation, function and turnover, these methods can be divided into: (I) prevention or differentiation to mature cells, (II) blockade of MDSC expansion and activation, (III) inhibition of MDSC suppressive activity or (IV) depletion of intratumoral MDSCs. This review describes effective mono- or multimodal-therapies that target MDSCs for the benefit of cancer treatment.
