Mechanisms used by MDSCs to decrease antitumor immunity and contribute to tumor immune escape. Treatment with sunitinib strongly decreases functionality of c-Kit and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), 2 receptors localized on both cancer cells and MDSCs, and involved in skewing of MDSCs toward an immunosuppressive phenotype. NoneThese results have been recapitulated in other tumors models in which treatment with zolendronic acid increased IFNgamma levels,decreased intratumoral MDSC levels and attenuated tumor growth. Various studies showed enhanced MDSC levels in the bone marrow and spleen of vitamin A deficient miceNoneand in mice treated with a pan-retinoic-acid-receptor antagonist. NoneFurthermore, a vaccine targeting the H-2Db-restricted epitope of the human papillomavirus 16 (HPV-16) E7 protein in combinationwith ATRA decreased the growth of implanted C3 fibrosarcomas by 3-fold. NoneLastly, the novelLentinus edodes-derived polysaccharide MPSSS was also found to induce MDSC differentiation, reducing MDSC levels and inhibiting tumor growth. NoneIn cancer patients a substantial increase in MDSCs in the periphery is often seen. Interestingly, during a clinical trial in which cancer patients were treated with antibodies neutralizing VEGF, (termed VEGF-traps), there was no change in MDSC levels. NoneInhibition of MMP-9, a downstream target of STAT3, lowered intratumoral MDSC levels and significantly delayed tumor growth. NoneMechanisms and strategies that may counteract these effects of MDSCs are discussed below. NoneSeveral attempts have been made to inhibit this MDSC-mediated nutrient depletion. NoneIndeed, blockade of PGE2 synthesis in tumor-bearing mice and humans resulted in improved antitumor T-cell responses. This downregulation resulted in MDSC inhibition, induction of antitumor immune responses and delay of tumor progression. These reactive species, which are the result of cooperative activities of NADPH oxidase, ARG1, iNOS and TGFbeta,Nonecause loss of TCR zeta-chain expression and desensitization of the TCR. Moreover, CDDO-Me therapy decreased MDSC-mediated ROS production, enhanced T-cell function and reduced murine tumor growth. NoneVarious studies have shown that MDSCs can also influence lymphocyte tumor trafficking and viability. Furthermore, MDSC suppression was also revealed in bone marrow and blood harvested 24 and 48 h after gemcitabine treatment. Five-FU administration to tumor-bearing mice increased survival, possibly due to enhanced cytotoxic T-cell activation. Intravenous peptibody administration completely depleted intratumoral, intrasplenic and circulating MDSC subsets. NoneSimilarly, a significant increase in tumor-specific T-cell responses and a prolonged antitumor effect was observed in various tumor models after combined treatment of ATRA with 2 different cancer vaccines. Additionally, this multi-therapy induced a regression of tumor growth, thereby leading to 75% of mice exhibiting tumor-free survival in a pre-clinical model of HPV-induced cancer (None, unpublished data). NoneCurrent knowledge indicates MDSC-mediated immune suppression as a main hallmark of cancer development.
