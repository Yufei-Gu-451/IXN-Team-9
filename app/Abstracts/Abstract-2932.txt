The study examined young adult smokers' neural response to graphic warning labels (GWLs) on cigarette packs using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Nineteen young adult smokers (GWLs produced significantly greater self-reported MTQ than control warnings (In this sample of young adult smokers, GWLs promoted neural activation in brain regions involved in cognitive and affective decision-making and memory formation and the effects of GWLs did not differ on branded or plain cigarette packaging. These findings complement other recent neuroimaging GWL studies conducted with older adult smokers and with adolescents by demonstrating similar patterns of neural activation in response to GWLs among young adult smokers. Novel data on the neurobiological effect of graphic cigarette warning labels (GWLs)GWLs produced activation indicating emotional and cognitive decision-making. Activation in response to GWLs also indicates memory formation. No differences in neural activity for GWLs on branded or plain cigarette packages
