Accumulated evidence shows that EZH2 is deregulated in a wide range of cancer types, and it has a crucial role in stem cell maintenance and tumour development. Therefore, blocking EZH2 expression or activity may represent a promising strategy for anticancer treatment. In this review, we address the current understanding of the mechanisms underlying EZH2 regulation alongside the function of EZH2 gene targets that are involved in cancer progression. Finally, we will describe cancer therapies that target EZH2 or its downstream cascades, which could potentially reverse the oncogenic and stemness properties of the tumour cells to suppress cancer progression and recurrence.
