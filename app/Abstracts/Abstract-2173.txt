Neuroimaging studies have revealed abnormalities in brain structure, including the striatum, in obese people. We aimed to investigate the cellular and parenchymal basis for these findings in post-mortem brain tissue. Design-based (unbiased) stereology combined with histochemical and immunocytochemical staining were used to quantify total number of neurons and astrocytes in post-mortem striatal brain samples from 9 obese (BMI 40.2+/-6.1 kg*mThere were no differences in mean total numbers of neurons (obese: 7.60E+06; SD 2.50E+06; lean: 7.85E+06; SD 8.26E+05; p less than 0.78) or astrocytes (obese: 7.42E+06; SD 2.27E+06; lean: 7.43E+06; SD 2.50E+06; p less than 0.99). A higher variance was found for number of neurons (p less than 0.007) but not astrocytes (p less than 0.72) in the obese group. Neuron/glia ratios were similar in both groups (obese: 1.07; SD 0.39; lean: 1.15; SD 0.37; p less than 0.70) with an overall striatal neuron/glia ratio of 1.11 (SD 0.37) across the entire study population (n=17). We found no difference in the average numbers of neurons and astrocytes in the anterior striatum between lean and obese people. The morphological basis for structural brain changes in obesity requires further investigation.
