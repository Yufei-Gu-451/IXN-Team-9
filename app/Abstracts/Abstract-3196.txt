The pancreas in type 1 diabetes exhibits decreased size (weight/volume) and abnormal exocrine morphology. Serum trypsinogen levels are an established marker of pancreatic exocrine function. As such, we hypothesized that trypsinogen levels may be reduced in patients with pre-type 1 diabetes and type 1 diabetes compared with healthy control subjects. Serum trypsinogen levels were determined in 100 persons with type 1 diabetes (72 new-onset, 28 established), 99 autoantibody-positive (AAbTrypsinogen levels increased significantly with age in control subjects (These findings further support the interplay between pancreatic endocrine and exocrine dysfunction. Longitudinal studies are warranted to validate trypsinogen as a predictive biomarker of type 1 diabetes progression.
