Activating mutations in theTo localize and quantify the effect of glibenclamide administration, we performed single-photon emission computed tomography in seven patients with different mutations inSignificant changes in single-photon emission computed tomography signal intensity after transfer to SU therapy were restricted to the cerebellum, consistent with previous data showing high Kir6.2 expression in this brain region. Cerebellar perfusion improved for both left (We conclude it is likely that at least some of the beneficial effects of SU treatment on neurodevelopment in iDEND patients result from improved cerebellar perfusion.
