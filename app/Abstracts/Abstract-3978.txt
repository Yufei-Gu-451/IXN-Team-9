Lung adenocarcinoma, the most common type of human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), frequently overexpresses EGFR. However, the mechanisms underlying EGFR overexpression are not completely understood. Recent studies have identified that decreased expression of TIP30 is associated with the metastasis of human NSCLCs, but a causative relationship between TIP30 deficiency and NSCLC development remains unclear. We show here that
