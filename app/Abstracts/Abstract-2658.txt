Simultaneous chemotherapy with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibition has not shown additional benefit over chemotherapy alone in advanced melanoma. We tested administration of the potent VEGF inhibitor axitinib followed by paclitaxel/carboplatin to determine whether enhanced tumour proliferation during axitinib withdrawal leads to sustained chemosensitivity. We conducted a prospective phase II trial in metastatic melanoma patients with ECOG performance status 0-1 and normal organ function. Axitinib 5 mg PO b.i.d. was taken on days 1-14 of each 21-day treatment cycle, and carboplatin (AUC=5) with paclitaxel (175 mg mThe treatment was well tolerated. The most common grade 3 AEs were hypertension, neutropenia, and anaemia. Grade 4 non-haematologic AEs were not observed. Four of five patients completingAxitinib followed by carboplatin and paclitaxel was well tolerated and effective in BRAF wild-type metastatic melanoma. 3'-Deoxy-3'-
