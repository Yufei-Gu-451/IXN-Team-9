In this study, the role of sucrose non-fermenting-related kinase (SNRK) in white adipocyte biology was investigated. SNRK is abundantly expressed in adipose tissue, and the expression level is decreased in obese mice. SNRK expression is repressed by inflammatory signals but increased by insulin sensitizer in cultured adipocytes. In vivo, adipose tissue
