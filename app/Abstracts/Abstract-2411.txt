Renal vein thrombosis, a rare complication of renal transplantation, often causes graft loss. Diagnosis includes ultrasound with Doppler, and it is often treated with anticoagulation or mechanical thrombectomy. Success is improved with early diagnosis and institution of treatment. We report here the case of a 29 year-old female with sudden development of very late-onset renal vein thrombosis after simultaneous kidney pancreas transplant. This resolved initially with thrombectomy, stenting and anticoagulation, but thrombosis recurred, necessitating operative intervention. Intraoperatively the renal vein was discovered to be compressed by a large ovarian cyst. Compression of the renal vein by a lymphocele or hematoma is a known cause of thrombosis, but this is the first documented case of compression and thrombosis due to an ovarian cyst. Early detection and treatment of renal vein thrombosis is paramount to restoring renal allograft function. Any woman of childbearing age may have thrombosis due to compression by an ovarian cyst, and screening for this possibility may improve long-term graft function in this population.
