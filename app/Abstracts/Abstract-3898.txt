Management of diabetic foot infection (DFI) has been hampered by limited means of accurately classifying disease severity. New hybrid nuclear/computed tomography (CT) imaging techniques elucidate a combination of wound infection parameters not previously evaluated as outcome prognosticators. Our aim is to determine if a novel standardized hybrid image-based scoring system, Composite Severity Index (CSI), has prognostic value in DFI. Masked retrospectiveCSI ranged from 0-13. Receiver operating characteristic accuracy for predicting favorable outcome was 0.79 (optimal cutoff CSI, less than =2; odds ratio of therapeutic failure for CSI greater than 2, 15.1 [95% CI 4.4-51.5]). CSI of 0 had a 92% chance of favorable outcome, which fell progressively to 25% as indices rose to greater than =7. Image-based osteomyelitis versus no osteomyelitis assessment was less accurate than CSI at predicting outcome (
