Patients with a BMI less than 35 kg/mThe SOS study involved 2,010 obese patients who underwent bariatric surgery (68% vertical-banded gastroplasty, 19% banding, and 13% gastric bypass) and 2,037 contemporaneously matched obese controls receiving usual care. At inclusion, the participant age was 37-60 years and BMI was greater than =34 kg/mCardiovascular risk factors were significantly improved both in noneligible and eligible individuals after 10 years of follow-up. Surgery reduced the diabetes incidence in both the noneligible (adjusted hazard ratio 0.33 [95% CI 0.13-0.82],Bariatric surgery drastically reduced the incidence of type 2 diabetes both in noneligible and eligible patients and improved cardiovascular risk factors in both groups. Our results show that strict BMI cutoffs are of limited use for bariatric surgery prioritization if the aim is to prevent diabetes and improve cardiovascular risk factors.
