BCR-ABL transforms bone marrow progenitor cells and promotes genome instability, leading to development of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). The tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib effectively treats CML, but acquired resistance can develop due to BCR-ABL mutations. Mechanisms for acquisition of BCR-ABL mutations are not fully understood. Using a novel culture model of CML acquired resistance, we show that inhibition of SIRT1 deacetylase by small molecule inhibitors or gene knockdown blocks acquisition of BCR-ABL mutations and relapse of CML cells on tyrosine kinase inhibitors. SIRT1 knockdown also suppresses
