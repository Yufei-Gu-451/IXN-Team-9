Spinophilin, a multifunctional intracellular scaffold protein, is reduced in certain types of cancer and is regarded as a novel putative tumour suppressor protein. However, the role of spinophilin in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has never been explored before. In this study, we determined for the first time the expression pattern of spinophilin in human HCC by immunohistochemistry and quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis. In addition, we performed immunohistochemical analysis of p53, p14In our study, complete loss of spinophilin immunoreactivity was found in 44 of 104 HCCs (42.3%) and reduced levels were found in an additional 37 (35.6%) cases. After adjusting for other prognostic factors, multivariate Cox regression analysis identified low expression of spinophilin as an independent prognostic factor with respect to disease-free (hazard ratio (HR)=1.8; 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.04-3.40;This is the first study of the expression pattern and distribution of spinophilin in HCC. According to our data, the loss of spinophilin is associated with higher proliferation and might be useful as a prognostic marker in patients with HCC.
