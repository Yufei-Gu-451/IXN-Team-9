Metastatic progression, including extravasation and micro-metastatic outgrowth, is the main cause of cancer patient death. Recent studies suggest that cancer cells reprogram their metabolism to support increased proliferation through increased glycolysis and biosynthetic activities, including lipogenesis pathways. However, metabolic changes during metastatic progression, including alterations in regulatory gene expression, remain undefined. We show that transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFbeta1) induced Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) is accompanied by coordinately reduced enzyme expression required to convert glucose into fatty acids, and concomitant enhanced respiration. Over-expressed Snail1, a transcription factor mediating TGFbeta1-induced EMT, was sufficient to suppress carbohydrate-responsive-element-binding protein (ChREBP, a master lipogenic regulator), and fatty acid synthase (FASN), its effector lipogenic gene. Stable FASN knock-down was sufficient to induce EMT, stimulate migration and extravasation
