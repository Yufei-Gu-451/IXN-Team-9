We have previously shown that AAV2 undergoes anterograde axonal transport in rat and non-human primate brain. We screened other AAV serotypes for axonal transport and found that AAV6 is transported almost exclusively in a retrograde direction and, like AAV2, it is also neuron-specific in rat brain. Our findings show that axonal transport of AAV is serotype-dependent and this has implications for gene therapy of neurological diseases such as Huntington's disease.
