Most patients presenting with advanced ovarian cancer (AOC) eventually relapse. Symptom palliation, maintenance of quality of life (QoL) and prolongation of life are primary therapeutic goals. Sixty-six UK oncologists completed an online survey about AOC management. Two hundred and two patients were interviewed about care, treatment experiences and expectations. Prior to diagnosis, 34% (69 out of 202) of women had ?3 symptoms associated with AOC. Twenty-one per cent (43 out of 202) thought poor symptom recognition by general practitioners (GPs) delayed diagnosis. Amelioration of side effects experienced was variable, for example, only 54% (68 out of 127) distressed by alopecia had received sufficient information about it. Clinicians were asked 'What minimum gain in progression-free survival (PFS) would make you feel it worthwhile to offer maintenance therapy?' 48% (24 out of 50) indicated 5-6 months, but 52% (26 out of 50) believed patients would find PFS of 3-4 months acceptable. When patients were presented with hypothetical scenarios, 33% (52 out of 160) would require 1-2 months extra life, 6% (10 out of 160) 3-4 months, 31% (49 out of 160) 5-6 months, and 31% (49 out of 160) ?7 months. However, 86% (173 out of 202) would accept treatment that improved QoL without prolongation of life. When asked what was most important, 33% (67 out of 201) said QoL, 9% (19 out of 201) length of life and 57% (115 out of 201) said both were equally important. Clinicians' and patients' experiences, expectations and priorities about OC management may differ.
