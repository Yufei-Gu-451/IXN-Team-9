To investigate the effect of risperidone on energy expenditure and weight gain in female C57BL/6J mice. Body weight and composition, food intake, energy expenditure, and activity were determined weekly. mRNA expression of uncoupling protein 1 in brown adipose tissue, orexin and brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the hypothalamus were quantified by Real-Time PCR. Risperidone tended to induce a greater body weight gain (Risperidone-induced weight gain is associated with hyperphagia and a reduction in locomotor activity in C57BL/6J mice. Additionally, higher total and resting energy expenditure were accompanied by higher levels of UCP1 mRNA in BAT. The increased total energy expenditure could not offset the total intake of energy through risperidone-induced hyperphagia, therefore resulting in weight gain in female C57BL/6J mice.
