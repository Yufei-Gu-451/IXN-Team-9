Genome-wide association studies allowed the identification of several associations between specific loci and type 1 diabetes (T1D). However, the mechanisms by which most candidate genes predispose to T1D remain unclear. We presently evaluated the mechanisms by whichSmall interfering RNAs were used to inhibit PTPN2, STAT1, Bim, and Jun NHPTPN2 knockdown exacerbated type I IFN-induced apoptosis in INS-1E, primary rat, and human beta-cells. PTPN2 silencing and exposure to type I and II IFNs induced BAX translocation to the mitochondria, cytochrome c release, and caspase 3 activation. There was also an increase in Bim phosphorylation that was at least in part regulated by JNK1. Of note, both Bim and JNK1 knockdown protected beta-cells against IFN-induced apoptosis in PTPN2-silenced cells. The present findings suggest that local IFN production may interact with a genetic factor (
