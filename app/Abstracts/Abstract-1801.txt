To evaluate the value of post-treatment follow-up in osteosarcoma patients. Data were collected through a clinical record, with socio-demographic and clinical data, and information relating to the medical appointment. Descriptive analysis of the data was carried out. The Chi-squared test was used to associate the independent variables with attendance at scheduled follow-up appointments. We found a recurrence in 59.6% of cases, of which 58% were lung related; 44% presented clinical complaints and arrived on the scheduled date of the appointment. There was no statistically significant association between the demographic characteristics and early attendance of follow-up visits. 81.3% of the cases who came for the appointment earlier than originally scheduled presented complaints compared to those who did not (p=0.005). Of the cases who presented recurrence, 12.9% attended an appointment late and those who did not present recurrence, 47.6% were late for the appointment (p=0.006). It is seen that the patients who came for an earlier appointment presented more complaints and were associated with the positive result of the exams carried out. The patients who had recurrence and came for an earlier appointment did not present a statistically significant difference in recurrence-free survival. It was observed that distance was not a predominant factor in late attendance at appointments.
