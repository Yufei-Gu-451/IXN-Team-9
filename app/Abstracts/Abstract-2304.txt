To improve resiliency and reduce burnout in nurses through implementation of the Healing Pathways program (University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore). Aims of this study include assessment of feasibility and acceptability and to explore changes in stress, coping, burnout, and mindfulness. A single-group, pre-, posttest design of an 8-week program in which participants attended weekly sessions that included Reiki, yoga, and meditation. Sample included 8 nurses with 1 advanced practice nurse, all female, ages ranging from 22 to 49 years, experience levels ranging from less than 1 year to 26 years. Participants completed the Perceived Stress Scale, Coping Self-Efficacy Scale, Maslach Burnout Inventory, and Mindful Attention Awareness Scale before intervention, at last session, and 1 month after last session. Data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance and qualitative narrative inquiry. Improvements were noted in perceived stress, coping, burnout exhaustion subscale, and mindfulness. Healing Pathways was effective at reducing stress and improving coping and mindfulness in nurses. Nurses who invest time in self-care techniques including Reiki, yoga, and meditation improve their overall wellbeing and may provide higher-quality patient care. Implementation of an 8-week program in integrative self-care is feasible and important for the health of nurses.
