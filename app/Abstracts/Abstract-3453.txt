A proportional balance between alphabeta and gammadelta T cell subsets in the periphery is exceedingly well maintained via a homeostatic mechanism. However, a cellular mechanism underlying the regulation remains undefined. We recently reported that a subset of developing gammadelta T cells spontaneously acquire IL-17-producing capacity even within naive animals via a TGFbeta1-dependent mechanism, thus considered 'einnate' IL-17-producing cells. Here we report that gammadelta T cells generated within alphabeta T cell (or CD4 T cell)-deficient environments displayed altered cytokine profiles; particularly, 'einnate' IL-17 expression was significantly impaired compared to those in wild type mice. Impaired IL-17 production in gammadelta T cells was directly related to the CD4 T cell deficiency, because depletion of CD4 T cells in wild type mice diminished and adoptive CD4 T cell transfer into TCRbeta-/- mice restored IL-17 expression in gammadelta T cells. CD4 T cell-mediated IL-17 expression required TGFbeta1. Moreover, Th17 but not Th1 or Th2 effector CD4 T cells were highly efficient in enhancing gammadelta T cell IL-17 expression. Taken together, our results highlight a novel CD4 T cell-dependent mechanism that shapes the generation of IL-17+ gammadelta T cells in naive settings.
