rs601338A greater than G was genotyped in 8,344 patients with type 1 diabetes, 10,008 control subjects, and 3,360 type 1 diabetic families. Logistic regression models were used to analyze the case-control collection, and conditional logistic regression was used to analyze the family collection. The nonsecretor A/A genotype of rs601338A greater than G was found to confer susceptibility to type 1 diabetes in both the case-control and family collections (odds ratio for AA 1.29 [95% CI 1.20-1.37] and relative risk for AA 1.22 [95% CI = 1.12-1.32]; combinedOur findings linking
