Stargardt macular dystrophy (STGD) results in early central vision loss. We sought to explain the genetic cause of STGD in a cohort of 88 patients from three different cultural backgrounds. Next Generation Sequencing using a novel capture panel was used to search for disease causing mutations. Unsolved patients were clinically re-examined and tested for copy number variations (CNVs) as well as intronic mutations. We determined the cause of disease in 67% of our patients. Our analysis identified 35 novelThis study expands our knowledge of STGD by identifying dozens of novel STGD causing alleles. The frequency of patients with single mutations in
