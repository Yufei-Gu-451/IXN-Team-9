Diffusion-weighted and diffusion tensor imaging (DWI/DTI) has revolutionized clinical neuroimaging. Pathology may be detected earlier and with greater specificity than with conventional magnetic resonance imaging sequences. In addition, DWI/DTI allows exploring the microarchitecture of the brain. A detailed knowledge of the basics of DWI/DTI is mandatory to better understand pathology encountered and to avoid misinterpretation of typical DWI/DTI artifacts. This article reviews the basic physics of DWI/DTI exemplified by several classical clinical cases.
