8-Oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) is the most abundant marker of DNA damage and it reflects oxidative stress. Human 8-oxoguanine glycosylase (hOGG1) is a DNA-repair enzyme that participates in 8-oxodG removal. hOGG1 protein expression was immunohistochemically studied in 96 patients with local or locally advanced breast cancer and in 20 lesions of non-malignant breast disease. 8-OxodG levels had been previously determined in all patients. hOGG1 was overexpressed in invasiveThe current results imply that absence of hOGG1 expression is associated with features of aggressive breast cancer. Tumours lacking both 8-oxodG and hOGG1 seem to indicate especially poor prognosis.
