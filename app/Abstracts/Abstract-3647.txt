Type 2 diabetes ultimately results from pancreatic beta-cell failure. Abnormally elevated intracellular regeneration of glucocorticoids by the enzyme 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11beta-HSD1) in fat or liver may underlie pathophysiological aspects of the metabolic syndrome. Elevated 11beta-HSD1 is also found in pancreatic islets of obese/diabetic rodents and is hypothesized to suppress insulin secretion and promote diabetes. To define the direct impact of elevated pancreatic beta-cell 11beta-HSD1 on insulin secretion, we generated beta-cell-specific, 11beta-HSD1-overexpressing (MIP-HSD1) mice on a strain background prone to beta-cell failure. Unexpectedly, MIP-HSD1
