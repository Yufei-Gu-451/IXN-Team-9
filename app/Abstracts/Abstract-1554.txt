MDSC-derived nitric oxide supports the development of Th17 cells in ovarian cancer dependent on the induction of endogenous NOS2 and the cGMP-cGK pathway in Th17 cells. Nitric oxide (NO) is a ubiquitous mediator of inflammation and immunity, involved in the pathogenesis and control of infectious diseases, autoimmunity, and cancer. We observed that the expression of nitric oxide synthase-2 (NOS2/iNOS) positively correlates with Th17 responses in patients with ovarian cancer (OvCa). Although high concentrations of exogenous NO indiscriminately suppress the proliferation and differentiation of Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells, the physiological NO concentrations produced by patients' myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) support the development of RORgammat(Rorc)
