Clinical trials under-represent patients (pts) greater than 65 years. Non-interventional studies (NISs) help to evaluate therapies in daily practice. This NIS evaluates efficacy and safety of cetuximab in combination with chemotherapy in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) pts aged greater than 65 yearsA total of 657 pts were recruited into the NIS and analysed applying descriptive statistics andA total of 309 and 305 pts aged ?65 and greater than 65 years, respectively, were documented; 80% showing a reduced ECOG status of 1-2 and 95% having received at least one palliative treatment. Cetuximab was combined with irinotecan according to approval status. Grade III/IV toxicities occurred in 20% of pts without any difference between age groups although the older pts had significantly more pre-existing comorbidities (This NIS reports one of the largest mCRC collectives greater than 65 years and reduced performance status. Cetuximab has a similar efficacy and safety profile for pts aged ?65 and greater than 65 years.
