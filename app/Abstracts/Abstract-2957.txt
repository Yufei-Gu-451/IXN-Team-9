BRCA1 is an important mediator of the DNA damage response, which promotes homologous recombination (HR) and antagonizes 53BP1-dependent non-homologous end joining in S/G2 phase. But how this is achieved remains unclear. Here, we report that the E3 ubiquitin ligase UHRF1 (Ubiquitin-like, with PHD and RING finger domains 1) directly participates in the interplay between BRCA1 and 53BP1. Mechanistically, UHRF1 is recruited to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by BRCA1 in S phase, which requires the BRCT domain of BRCA1 and phosphorylated Ser674 of UHRF1. Subsequently, UHRF1 mediates K63-linked polyubiquitination of RIF1, and results in its dissociation from 53BP1 and DSBs thereby facilitating HR initiation. Thus, UHRF1 is a key regulator of DSB repair choice, which is separate from its role in heterochromatin formation and epigenetic regulator.
