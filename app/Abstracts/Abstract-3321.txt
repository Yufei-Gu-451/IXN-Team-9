To investigate the effect of 4 weeks of treatment with liraglutide on insulin dose and glycemic control in type 1 diabetic patients with and without residual beta-cell function. Ten type 1 diabetic patients with residual beta-cell function (C-peptide positive) and 19 without (C-peptide negative) were studied. All C-peptide-positive patients were treated with liraglutide plus insulin, whereas C-peptide-negative patients were randomly assigned to liraglutide plus insulin or insulin monotherapy. Continuous glucose monitoring with identical food intake and physical activity was performed before (week 0) and during (week 4) treatment. Differences in insulin dose; HbAInsulin dose decreased from 0.50 +/- 0.06 to 0.31 +/- 0.08 units/kg per day (Treatment with liraglutide in type 1 diabetic patients reduces insulin dose with improved or unaltered glycemic control.
