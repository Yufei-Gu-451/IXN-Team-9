Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for thoracic tumours has emerged as a minimally invasive therapy option for primary and secondary lung tumours and has gained increasing acceptance for pain palliation. The procedure is well tolerated and the complication rates are low. RFA provides the opportunity for localized tissue destruction of limited tumour volumes with medium and long term follow-up data suggesting that survival figures do parallel those of non-surgical treatment modalities. The purpose of this article is to review the status of RFA in lung tumours, to emphasize its place in symptomatic palliation and to discuss its potential role in conjunction with radiation or systemic therapy.
