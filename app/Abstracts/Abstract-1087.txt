Low testosterone (T) levels in men have been shown to predict development of the metabolic syndrome, but the effects of T on lipid metabolism are incompletely understood. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, 12 healthy, young males received gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist treatment 1 month prior to 3 of 4 trial days to induce castrate levels of T. On trial days, T gel was applied to the body containing either high or low physiological T dose or placebo. On the 4th trial day, participants constituted their own eugonadal controls. Each study comprised a 5-h basal period and a 3-h hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. Short-term hypogonadism did not affect VLDL triglyceride (TG) secretion, nor did it affect VLDL-TG concentrations. It was, however, characterized by lower total lipid oxidation. In addition, acute rescue with high physiological T increased VLDL-TG secretion during both basal and clamp conditions. These data show that T can act through fast nongenomic pathways in the liver. In addition, the early hypogonadal state is characterized by decreased total lipid oxidation, but whether these changes represent early hypogonadal metabolic dysfunction warrants further investigations. T is not a major determinant of resting VLDL-TG kinetics in men.
