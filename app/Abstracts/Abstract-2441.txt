Death domain-associated protein 6 (DAXX) is a histone chaperone, putative regulator of apoptosis and transcription, and candidate modulator of p53-mediated gene expression following DNA damage. DAXX becomes phosphorylated upon DNA damage, however regulation of this modification, and its relationship to p53 remain unclear. Here we show that in human cells exposed to ionizing radiation or genotoxic drugs etoposide and neocarzinostatin, DAXX became rapidly phosphorylated in an ATM kinase-dependent manner. Our deletion and site-directed mutagenesis experiments identified Serine 564 (S564) as the dominant ATM-targeted site of DAXX, and immunofluorescence experiments revealed localization of S564-phosphorylated DAXX to PML nuclear bodies. Furthermore, using a panel of human cell types, we identified the p53-regulated Wip1 protein phosphatase as a key negative regulator of DAXX phosphorylation at S564, both
