No analytic epidemiological study has examined the relationship between use of muscle-building supplements (MBSs) and testicular germ cell cancer (TGCC) risk. We conducted a population-based case-control study including 356 TGCC cases and 513 controls from Connecticut and Massachusetts. The odds ratio (OR) for ever use of MBSs in relation to risk of TGCC was significantly elevated (OR=1.65, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.11-2.46). The associations were significantly stronger among early users, men with more types of MBSs used, and longer periods of use. MBS use is a potentially modifiable risk factor that may be associated with TGCC.
