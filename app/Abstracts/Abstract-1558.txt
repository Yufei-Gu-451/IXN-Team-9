Absence of the phosphatase Shp1 in T cells does not affect the TCR signaling threshold but results in IL-4 sensitivity and memory phenotype cells. The protein-tyrosine phosphatase Shp1 is expressed ubiquitously in hematopoietic cells and is generally viewed as a negative regulatory molecule. Mutations in
