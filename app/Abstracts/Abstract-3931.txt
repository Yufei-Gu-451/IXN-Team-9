Radical resection is the only potential cure for patients with locally advanced primary and recurrent rectal cancer and is considered curative only when the histologic margins are clear of tumour. Early diagnosis of the disease is essential as it increases the likelihood of a potentially curative resection and prevention of dissemination. Clinical examination, tumour markers and radiologic modalities such as ultrasonography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography are routinely used in an effort to accurately stage these patients and provide useful information for the selection of patients for further treatment/management. This review describes the methods of staging patients with locally advanced primary and recurrent rectal cancer prior to surgery emphasizing the role that radiologists have in this process.
