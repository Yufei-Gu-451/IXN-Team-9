To evaluate the correlation between radiographic parameters of the proximal femur anatomy and fractures. Three hundred and five digital x-rays of the pelvis were analyzed in the anteroposterior view. Of these x-rays, twenty-seven showed femoral neck or transtrochanteric fractures. The anatomical parameters analyzed were: femoral neck width (FNW), femoral neck length (FNL), femoral axis length (FAL), cervicodiaphyseal angle (CDA), acetabular tear-drop distance (ATD) and great trochanter-pubic symphysis distance (GTPSD). The analysis was performed by comparing the results of the x-rays with and without proximal femoral fracture, to establish a correlation between them. No differences were found between the anatomical parameters of the groups with and without proximal femoral fracture. There was no association between anatomical changes in the proximal femur and greater susceptibility to fractures.
