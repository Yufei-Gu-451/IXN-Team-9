We assessed the growth kinetics of pathologically proven benign neoplastic cystic lesions of the pancreas. The volume and longest axial diameter (LAD) of 20 pathologically proven pancreatic cystic lesions (12 mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCN) and 8 serous cystadenomas (SCN)) on 2 multidetector computed tomography scans, obtained before resection, were measured. Reciprocal of doubling time, doubling time and growth rate based on volume and LAD were calculated. A
