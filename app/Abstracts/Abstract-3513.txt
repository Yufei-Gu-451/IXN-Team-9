To assess public attitudes and interest in pharmacogenetic (PGx) testing, we conducted a random-digit-dial telephone survey of U.S. adults, achieving a response rate of 42% (n=1139). Most respondents expressed interest in PGx testing to predict mild or serious side effects (73% +/-3.29% and 85% +/-2.91%, respectively), guide dosing (91%) and assist with drug selection (92%). Younger individuals (ages 18-34) were more likely to be interested in PGx testing to predict serious side effects (vs. ages 55+), as well as Whites, those with a college degree, and who had experienced side effects from medications. However, most respondents (78% +/-3.14%) were not likely to have a PGx test if there was a risk that their DNA sample or test result could be shared without their permission. Given differences in interest among some groups, providers should clearly discuss the purpose of testing, alternative testing options (if available), and policies to protect patient privacy and confidentiality.
