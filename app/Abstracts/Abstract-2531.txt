The probe (WSP) contains two electrophilic centers. It should be noted that the reaction betweenWSPand biothiols cannot turn the fluorescence on; therefore, the selectivity ofWSPis found to be excellent. NoneAs described above, the possible consumption ofWSPprobes by biothiols is a weakness. Such a trapper should only react with H2S, not react with biothiols. Moreover, ideally the reaction product or intermediate should maintain high reactivity toward H2S which therefore can lead to fluorescence "turn-on" by H2S. None,NoneIt is also known that diselenides can facilitate disulfide formation from thiols. We also expected the diselenide bond should be quite reactive to biothiols (RSH). However, if H2S is present, the reaction should lead to intermediate5, and the following cyclization should produce7and the fluorophore. Overall we expected the probe would specifically react with H2S to release the fluorophore and the presence of biothiols should not interfere with the process. Structures of diselenide-based probes. With these two probes in hand, we tested their fluorescent properties. To this end, human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y) were separately treated withl- andd-cysteine (which are H2S biosynthestic substrates),S-adenosylmethyonine (SAM, a CBS activator), and aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA, a CBS inhibitor).
