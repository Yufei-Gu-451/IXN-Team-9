An increased level of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is correlated with a worse prognosis. IL-6 stimulates tumor-growth and inflammation. We investigated the intricate interaction between the IL-6 signaling pathway and tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells (TIMs) to determine their prognostic impact in EOC. 160 EOC samples were analyzed for the expression of IL-6, its receptor (IL-6R) and downstream signaling via pSTAT3 by immunohistochemistry. Triple color immunofluorescence confocal microscopy was used to identify myeloid cell populations by CD14, CD33, and CD163. The relationship between these markers, tumor-infiltrating immune cells, clinical-pathological characteristics and survival was investigated. EOC displayed a dense infiltration with myeloid cells, in particular of the CD163
