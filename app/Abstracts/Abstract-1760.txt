Inflammation is associated with pancreatic beta-cell apoptosis and reduced insulin sensitivity. Literature suggests that interleukin (IL)-1beta may contribute to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This study aimed to determine the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of LY2189102, a neutralizing IL-1beta antibody, in T2DM patients. Phase II, randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled study of subcutaneous LY2189102 (0.6, 18, and 180 mg) administered weekly for 12 weeks in T2DM patients on diet and exercise, with or without approved antidiabetic medications. LY2189102 reduced HbAWeekly subcutaneous LY2189102 for 12 weeks was well tolerated, modestly reduced HbA
