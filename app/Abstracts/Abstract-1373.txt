This study evaluates the geographic expression pattern of Raf-1 Kinase Inhibitor Protein (RKIP) in colorectal cancer (CRC) in correlation with clinicopathological and molecular features, markers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and survival outcome. Whole-tissue sections of 220 well-characterised CRCs were immunostained for RKIP. NF-RKIP was diffusely expressed in normal mucosa and progressively lost towards tumour centre and front (The clinical relevance of RKIP expression as an independent prognostic factor is restricted to the tumour centre. Loss of RKIP predicts features of EMT and correlates with frequent distant metastasis.
