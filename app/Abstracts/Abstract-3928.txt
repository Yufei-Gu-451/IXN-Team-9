Imaging is important in the decision-making process of how to treat a lung tumour, which ideally should be a multi-disciplinary team decision. Imaging is important during radiofrequency ablation (RFA) treatment with regard to optimal placement of the electrode, the immediate post-treatment criteria and very early detection of complications of the procedure. Imaging is very important in the treatment follow-up. In lung RFA, as in many other interventional procedures, the traditional morphological imaging techniques to evaluate treatment response have difficulties and functional imaging techniques may potentially be more useful. However, larger studies showing this impact have not yet been performed.
