To illustrate the progression of retrograde transsynaptic retinal degeneration using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). A 60 year-old man with a stroke was followed over a 17-month period using SD-OCT of the macula, ganglion cell layer (GCC), and retinal nerve fiber layer. Transsynaptic retinal degeneration progressed over this time. Retrograde transsynaptic retinal degeneration may occur in patients with homonymous visual field loss caused by post-geniculate neurologic disease. This is best detected as homonymous thinning of the retina, corresponding to the pattern of visual field loss, using SD-OCT of the GCC and macula. The retinal changes occur at a variable time following the onset of neurologic disease.
