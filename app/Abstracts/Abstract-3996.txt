To evaluate whether LY2605541 results in lower fasting blood glucose (FBG) versus insulin glargine (GL). This 12-week, randomized, open-label, Phase 2 study enrolled patients with type 2 diabetes (hemoglobin AAt 12 weeks, FBG (mean +/- SE) was similar with LY2605541 and GL (118.2 +/- 2.0 mg/dL [6.6 +/- 0.1 mmol/L] vs. 116.9 +/- 2.7 mg/dL [6.5 +/- 0.2 mmol/L],In patients with type 2 diabetes, LY2605541 and GL had comparable glucose control and total hypoglycemia rates, but LY2605541 showed reduced intraday variability, lower nocturnal hypoglycemia, and weight loss relative to GL.
