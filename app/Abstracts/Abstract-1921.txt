Creatine is important for energy metabolism, yet excitable cells such as cardiomyocytes do not synthesize creatine and rely on uptake via a specific membrane creatine transporter (CrT; SLC6A8). This process is tightly controlled with downregulation of CrT upon continued exposure to high creatine via mechanisms that are poorly understood. Our aim was to identify candidate endogenous CrT inhibitors. In 3T3 cells overexpressing the CrT, creatine uptake plateaued at 3 h in response to 5 mM creatine but peaked 33% higher (
