A clinical registry encompasses a selective set of rigorously collected and stored clinical data focused on a specific condition. Hip fracture is a common complication of osteoporosis in elderly patients. Hip fracture substantially increases the risk of death and major morbidity in the elderly patients. Limited data regarding hip fracture are available from Latin America and Argentina. The purpose of this project is to create an institutional registry of elderly patients with hip fracture in order to obtain data that reveal the impact of this disease in our environment, allowing us to evaluate different strategies of patient's care and clinical outcomes. To describe the implementation of an institutional registry of elderly patients with hip fracture in Argentina. In this article, we described the creation, implementation, and data management of a prospective registry of elderly patients with hip fracture. The registry contains information on baseline demographics, comorbidities, laboratory, and radiological data. Follow-up at 3 and 12 months postfracture is done by phone interview to assess physical function, readmissions, and morbi-mortality. Clinical Trials registry number NCT02279550. In this project, we have created a hip fracture registry. We hope that this registry will provide valuable data that can lead us to new lines of research, addressed to answer questions raised in clinical practice.
