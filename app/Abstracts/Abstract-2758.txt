In patients with advanced ovarian cancer, it can be challenging to evaluate response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy on computed tomography (CT) due to disseminated small volume disease and serosal disease. In addition, measuring the change in size of tumour burden takes time in order to allow tumour shrinkage. Despite these challenges, serum CA-125 levels and CT are the standard tools for the assessment of treatment response in ovarian cancer. New functional imaging techniques may allow the identification of response earlier and with higher accuracy. In this review article, we describe the current literature on functional imaging techniques in ovarian cancer response assessment, focusing on fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography.
