The role of TGF-beta signaling in tumorigenesis is paradoxical: it can be tumor suppressive or tumor promotional, depending on context. The metastatic regulator, Six1, was recently shown to mediate this switch, providing a novel means to explain this elusive "TGF-beta paradox". Herein, we identify a mechanism by which Six1 activates the tumor promotional arm of TGF-beta signaling, via its ability to upregulate the miR-106b-25 microRNA cluster, and further identify a novel function for this cluster of microRNAs. While expression of the miR-106b-25 cluster is known to overcome TGF-beta-mediated growth suppression via targeting p21 and BIM, we demonstrate for the first time that this same cluster can additionally target the inhibitory Smad7 protein, resulting in increased levels of the TGF-beta type I receptor (TbetaRI) and downstream
