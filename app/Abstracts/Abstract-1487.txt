Prolactin is a major stimulus for the beta-cell adaptation during gestation and guards postpartum women against gestational diabetes. Most studies of the role of prolactin on glucose metabolism have been conducted in humans and animals during pregnancy. However, little is known concerning the association between circulating prolactin and glucose metabolism outside pregnancy in epidemiological studies. We aimed to determine whether the variation of circulating prolactin concentration associates with diabetes and impaired glucose regulation (IGR) in a cross-sectional study. We recruited 2,377 participants (1,034 men and 1,343 postmenopausal women) without hyperprolactinemia, aged 40 years and older, in Shanghai, China. Diabetes and IGR were determined by an oral glucose tolerance test. Multinomial logit analyses were performed to evaluate the relationship of prolactin with diabetes and IGR. Prolactin levels decreased from normal glucose regulation to IGR to diabetes. Multinomial logit analyses, adjusted for potential confounding factors, showed that high circulating prolactin was associated with lower prevalence of diabetes and IGR. The adjusted odds ratios (95% CI) for IGR and diabetes for the highest compared with the lowest quartile of prolactin were 0.54 (95% CI 0.33-0.89) and 0.38 (0.24-0.59) in men and 0.54 (0.36-0.81) and 0.47 (0.32-0.70) in women. High circulating prolactin associates with lower prevalence of diabetes and IGR in the current study. Further studies are warranted to confirm this association.
