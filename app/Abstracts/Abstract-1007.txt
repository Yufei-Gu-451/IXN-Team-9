We investigated the factors that might influence the development of severe hypoglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes. From January 2000 to December 2002, patients with type 2 diabetes aged 25-75 years without chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate greater than =60 mL/min/1.73 mAfter a median 10.4 years of follow-up, 111 (12.6%) patients experienced 140 episodes of SH, and the incidence was 1.55 per 100 patient-years. Mean age and duration of diabetes were 55.3 +/- 9.8 and 9.8 +/- 6.5 years, respectively. The incidence of SH events was higher in older patients (The development of SH was independently associated with duration of diabetes and presence of macroalbuminuria, even with normal renal function in patients with type 2 diabetes.
