We assessed the effects of non-HLA gene polymorphisms on the risk of islet autoimmunity (IA) and progression to type 1 diabetes in the Diabetes Autoimmunity Study in the Young. A total of 1,743 non-Hispanic, white children were included: 861 first-degree relatives and 882 general population children identified as having high-risk HLA-DR/DQ genotypes for type 1 diabetes. Of those, 109 developed IA and 61 progressed to diabetes. Study participants were genotyped for 20 non-HLA polymorphisms, previously confirmed as type 1 diabetes susceptibility loci.
