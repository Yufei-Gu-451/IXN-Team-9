Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is suggested to cause hepatic insulin resistance by increasing de novo lipogenesis (DNL) and directly interfering with insulin signaling through the activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and IkappaB kinase (IKK) pathway. The current study interrogated these two proposed mechanisms in a mouse model of hepatic insulin resistance induced by a high fructose (HFru) diet with the treatment of fenofibrate (FB) 100 mg/kg/day, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) agonist known to reduce lipid accumulation while maintaining elevated DNL in the liver. FB administration completely corrected HFru-induced glucose intolerance, hepatic steatosis, and the impaired hepatic insulin signaling (pAkt and pGSK3beta). Of note, both the IRE1/XBP1 and PERK/eIF2alpha arms of unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling were activated. While retaining the elevated DNL (indicated by the upregulation of SREBP1c, ACC, FAS, and SCD1 and [
