To evaluate the effectiveness of a culturally adapted, primary care-based nurse-community health worker (CHW) team intervention to support diabetes self-management on diabetes control and other biologic measures. Two hundred sixty-eight Samoan participants with type 2 diabetes were recruited from a community health center in American Samoa and were randomly assigned by village clusters to the nurse-CHW team intervention or to a wait-list control group that received usual care. Participants had a mean age of 55 years, 62% were female, mean years of education were 12.5 years, 41% were employed, and mean HbAA culturally adapted nurse-CHW team intervention was able to significantly improve diabetes control in the U.S. Territory of American Samoa. This represents an important translation of an evidence-based model to a high-risk population and a resource-poor setting.
