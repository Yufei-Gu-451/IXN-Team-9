Hip fractures are a common emergency among the geriatric population and often requires immediate hospitalization for proper assessment. More than 90% of the time, hip fractures are suffered by individuals older than 65 and are usually precipitated predominantly by falls. Current studies show that the average individual over 65 years falls at least once a year, and roughly 1 out of every 4 of these individuals succumb to their injuries just 12 months following surgical treatment. Moreover, timely treatment and management of these hip fractures have shown to decrease mortality by reducing cardiopulmonary and venous thromboembolic complications that often accompany hip surgeries. As a result, an emphasis on initial preoperative assessment is important to help identify the presence of ancillary factors such as preexisting comorbidities, which can impact the course of treatment. Delaying surgical management of hip fractures has been linked to decreased functional outcomes and increased mortality rates. Time, rather than technique, appears to be a recurring factor that can impact the long-term survival of these patients. The initial preoperative assessment, therefore, presents a window of opportunity where possible interventions can be made in an effort to reduce the delay of surgery, minimize postsurgical complications, and ultimately improve mortality rate among patients with hip fracture.
