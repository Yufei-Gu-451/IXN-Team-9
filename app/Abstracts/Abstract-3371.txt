Although reduced intensity (RIC) and nonmyeloablative (NMA) conditioning regimens have been used for over a decade, their relative efficacy versus myeloablative (MA) approaches to allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and myelodysplasia (MDS) is unknown. We compared disease status, donor, graft and recipient characteristics with outcomes of 3731 MA with 1448 RIC/NMA procedures performed at 217 centers between 1997 and 2004. Five year univariate probabilities and multivariate relative risk (RR) outcomes of relapse, transplant related mortality (TRM), disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) are reported. Adjusted OS at 5 years was 34%, 33%, and 26% for MA, RIC and NMA transplants, respectively. NMA conditioning resulted in inferior DFS and OS but there was no difference in DFS and OS between RIC and MA regimens. Late TRM negates early decreases in toxicity with RIC and NMA regimens. Our data suggest higher regimen intensity may contribute to optimal survival in patients with AML/MDS, suggesting roles for both regimen intensity and graft vs. leukemia in these diseases. Prospective studies comparing regimens are needed to confirm this finding and determine the optimal approach to patients who are eligible for either MA or RIC/NMA conditioning.
