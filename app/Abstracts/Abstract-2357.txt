High-temperature-required protein A2 (HtrA2), a protein relating with apoptosis in a caspases-dependent and non-dependent manner, has been reported to be associated with chemosensitivity in several human cancers. Tissue microarrays made from 142 patients with high-grade serous ovarian adenocarcinoma were evaluated to assess whether HtrA2 expression was related with several clinical parameters. Negative HtrA2 expression was observed in 36 cases (25%) of the patients, and related with significantly lower response rates of primary chemotherapy than those with positive HtrA2 expression (56%HtrA2 expression was a predictor for sensitivity to chemotherapy, and could be a candidate of molecular target in the treatment of high-grade serous ovarian cancers.
