Previous studies have consistently identified maternal obesity and gestational weight gain as risk factors for macrosomia, but little is known about the effects of central adiposity and body fat distribution. Using self-reported data from the Black Women's Health Study (BWHS), a large follow-up study of U.S. black women, we examined the risk of macrosomia in relation to prepregnancy waist circumference, prepregnancy waist-to-hip ratio, prepregnancy body mass index (BMI), and gestational weight gain. During 1995-2003, BWHS participants ages 21 to 44 years delivered 6,687 full-term singleton births (gestational age greater than 37 weeks). We compared mothers of 691 infants weighing greater than =4000g with mothers of 5,996 infants weighing less than 4000g. Generalized estimating equation models that accounted for more than one birth per mother were used to estimate multivariable odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Independent of prepregnancy BMI, prepregnancy waist circumference was positively associated with risk of macrosomia (OR=1.58, 95% CI 1.07-2.32, for greater than =35.0 vs. less than 27.0 inches ( greater than =88.9 vs. less than 68.6 cm); P-trend= 0.04). As expected, prepregnancy BMI was also positively associated with macrosomia (OR=1.74, 95% CI 1.25-2.41 for BMI greater than =35.0 vs. 18.5-24.9 kg/m
