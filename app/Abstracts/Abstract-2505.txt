Previous preclinical and clinical studies have shown that NK cells may efficiently reduce or prevent graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) without any adverse impact on their important graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect. NoneMurine studies demonstrated that allogeneic, interleukin 2 (IL-2) stimulated NK cells protect from GVHD in models of allogeneic as well as haploidentical bone marrow transplantation (BMT). NoneIn addition, adoptively transferred NK cells have been shown to provide an important antitumor effect. To address the impact of different NK cell subsets on acute GVHD, we used a murine model for complete MHC-mismatched bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Based on our previous findings that c-Kit+NK cells are capable of mediating diverse immunoregulatory functions in cancer and autoimmune disease,Nonewe first addressed the possible impact of c-Kit expressing NK cells on GVHD. To this end, we administered either naive cell-sorted or IL-18 induced c-Kit-expressing donor NK cells 1 d prior to the adoptive transfer of alloreactive T cells into recipient mice. Two days after TBI, 7*105T cells from C57Bl/6 origin were injected i.v. We next investigated the specific influence of distinct IL-2 expanded NK cell subsets on GVHD. Following our observation that IL-2 expanded CD11b+NK cells were the only NK cell subset that reduced acute GVHD, we aimed to exclude a possible negative impact on GVL effects. In contrast and of particular importance, mice treated with IL-2 expanded CD11b+NK cells showed efficient GVL response (None) accompanied by a significantly reduced GVHD and improved survival. Transcriptome analysis of phenotypically distinct subsets of natural killer (NK) cells in mice. One day after sublethal total body irradiation (TBI), mice received 2*106freshly isolated bone marrow (BM) and congenic CD45.1+NK subsets. Furthermore, upon adoptive transfer of the four cell-sorted NK subsets from congenic mice based on their phenotypes as described above, we were able to monitor their distinct migratory behavior following BMT. On day 18 after BMT, recipient mice displayed similar NK cell numbers and subset distribution as naive animals. In additional BLI experiments specifically performed with the CD11b+NK subset isolated from Luciferase-expressing transgenic mice (B6-L2G85.CD45.1), we confirmed the migration of the CD11b+NK cells to the GVHD target organs (Fig. Remarkably, in mice developing GVHD following allogeneic BMT plus T cell transfer, a failure in immune reconstitution with significantly reduced numbers of NK cells, specifically mature CD11b+NK cells, could be observed (Fig. We furthermore aimed to address the antitumor capacity of specifically the IL-2 expanded CD11b+NK cells against the allogeneic luc+BCL1 leukemia cell line. As shown inNone, the BLI signal was reduced in mice treated with IL-2 expanded CD11b+NK cells demonstrating their anti-leukemic capacityin vivo(NoneNoneNone). Next, we asked if the mechanism by which NK cells inhibit GVHD,Nonecould also be attributed to the cytotoxic capacity of the subset of CD11b+NK cells. Indeed, donor CD11b+NK cells showed a significantly higher reduction of T-cell proliferation compared to CD27+NK cells in MLR performed with MoFlo sorted, IL-2 expanded donor NK cell subsets and CFSE labelled donor T cells stimulated by allogeneic DCs (None). It has recently been published in a murine model of allogeneic BMT that IL-2 expanded NK cells can diminish GVHD symptoms without any negative impact on GVL in a murine model of allogeneic GVHD. Interestingly, we observed a worsening of GVHD in mice receiving c-Kit-expressing NK cells. In humans, patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that underwent haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) showed improved event-free survival and reduced GVHD in case of killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) ligand mismatch in GVH direction. NoneFurthermore, clinical trials have been performed with adoptive transfer of expanded donor NK cells for different malignancies and for relapse either after immunosuppression or in the setting of haploidentical HSCT.
