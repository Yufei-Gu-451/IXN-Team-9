Natural killer (NK) cells are known to play important roles in innate and adaptive immunity. Previous preclinical and clinical studies have shown that NK cells may efficiently reduce or prevent graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) without any adverse impact on their important graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect. NoneMurine studies demonstrated that allogeneic, interleukin 2 (IL-2) stimulated NK cells protect from GVHD in models of allogeneic as well as haploidentical bone marrow transplantation (BMT). NoneIn addition, adoptively transferred NK cells have been shown to provide an important antitumor effect. Based on our previous findings that c-Kit+NK cells are capable of mediating diverse immunoregulatory functions in cancer and autoimmune disease,Nonewe first addressed the possible impact of c-Kit expressing NK cells on GVHD. All NK cell subsets were expanded by 1,500 U/mL IL-2 for 5 days as described in Methods. Transcriptome analysis of phenotypically distinct subsets of natural killer (NK) cells in mice. (B) Gene profiling of the four pre-dominant NK cell subsets. S2) comparable to the natural distribution of NK cell subsets in naive mice (Fig. These observations indicate that BM stroma did not support NK cell maturation. In sum, CD11b+NK cells possess the ability to traffic to peripheral organs that might be targets of GVHD. Remarkably, in mice developing GVHD following allogeneic BMT plus T cell transfer, a failure in immune reconstitution with significantly reduced numbers of NK cells, specifically mature CD11b+NK cells, could be observed (Fig. This observation highlights that adoptive transfer of this specific NK subset might diminish clinically manifested GVHD symptoms. As the GVL reaction is known to be mainly mediated by alloreactive T cells, we further aimed to investigate the direct cytotoxic capacity of the CD11b+NK cell subset on malignant cells. NoneNoneNoneHigh cytotoxicity and GVL effect mediated by CD11b+NK cells. (C) Luminescence imaging to assess the anti-leukemic capacity of CD11b+NK cellsin vivo. To solve this question, we performed cytotoxicity and mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) experiments (None). NoneNoneNoneCD11b+NK cells efficiently suppress T-cell proliferation by elimination of allogeneic DCs. Indeed, donor CD11b+NK cells showed a significantly higher reduction of T-cell proliferation compared to CD27+NK cells in MLR performed with MoFlo sorted, IL-2 expanded donor NK cell subsets and CFSE labelled donor T cells stimulated by allogeneic DCs (None). Importantly, our data also demonstrate that the CD11b+NK cells support GVL effects by their high antitumor efficiency. It has recently been published in a murine model of allogeneic BMT that IL-2 expanded NK cells can diminish GVHD symptoms without any negative impact on GVL in a murine model of allogeneic GVHD. In our experimental setting, the main mechanism distinguishing the impact of the different NK subpopulations was the cytotoxic capacity of the CD11b+subset directed against allogeneic bone marrow derived DCs, even when inflammatory conditions were mimicked by additional LPS stimulation inducing DC maturation (None). NoneFurthermore, clinical trials have been performed with adoptive transfer of expanded donor NK cells for different malignancies and for relapse either after immunosuppression or in the setting of haploidentical HSCT. It is already known that mature, KIR-expressing CD56dimCD16highNK cells, as the putative counterpart of the murine CD11b+NK subset, require longer time intervals relative to CD56highCD16brightNK cells to recover after HSCT.
