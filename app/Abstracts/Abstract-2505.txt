(E) Colonoscopy on day 14 of mice from the BMT control, GVHD group, and mice that additionally received IL-2 expanded CD27+or CD11b+NK cell subsets. Following our observation that IL-2 expanded CD11b+NK cells were the only NK cell subset that reduced acute GVHD, we aimed to exclude a possible negative impact on GVL effects. In contrast, all mice additionally receiving alloreactive T cells (BM + T), a portion of which further received IL-2 expanded CD27+or CD11b+NK cells (as defined above), were protected from leukemia by a strong GVL effect (None). (B) Influence of additional treatment with IL-2 expanded CD27+or CD11b+NK cells on leukemia growth. In contrast and of particular importance, mice treated with IL-2 expanded CD11b+NK cells showed efficient GVL response (None) accompanied by a significantly reduced GVHD and improved survival. NoneNoneNoneNoneGene profiling of murine NK subsets. (B) Gene profiling of the four pre-dominant NK cell subsets. NoneNoneNoneMigration capacity of specific NK cell subsets. (A) Scheme of murine transplantation model to study migration capacity. These observations indicate that BM stroma did not support NK cell maturation. In additional BLI experiments specifically performed with the CD11b+NK subset isolated from Luciferase-expressing transgenic mice (B6-L2G85.CD45.1), we confirmed the migration of the CD11b+NK cells to the GVHD target organs (Fig. As described above, the adoptive transfer of IL-2 expanded CD11b+NK cells delayed the onset and reduced the severity of acute GVHD, but preserved GVL (NoneandNone). As shown inNone, the BLI signal was reduced in mice treated with IL-2 expanded CD11b+NK cells demonstrating their anti-leukemic capacityin vivo(NoneNoneNone). NoneNoneNoneHigh cytotoxicity and GVL effect mediated by CD11b+NK cells. (C) Luminescence imaging to assess the anti-leukemic capacity of CD11b+NK cellsin vivo. NoneNoneNoneCD11b+NK cells efficiently suppress T-cell proliferation by elimination of allogeneic DCs. Indeed, donor CD11b+NK cells showed a significantly higher reduction of T-cell proliferation compared to CD27+NK cells in MLR performed with MoFlo sorted, IL-2 expanded donor NK cell subsets and CFSE labelled donor T cells stimulated by allogeneic DCs (None). With this work, we succeeded to identify CD11b+NK cells as the main effector NK subset mediating the best improvement of GVHD by specific migration capacity, high cytotoxic potential and inhibition of DC induced alloreactive T-cell proliferation under inflammatory conditions. Importantly, our data also demonstrate that the CD11b+NK cells support GVL effects by their high antitumor efficiency. We transferred highly purified c-Kit+(None), or IL-2 expanded CD27+versus CD11b+NK cells prior to GVHD induction (None). The overall modulation of GVHD by the subset of CD11b+NK cells corresponds well to the effects obtained by the whole NK cell pool following IL-2 stimulation as reported by Olson et al. Multiple reasons might explain the exclusive impact of the CD11b+subset in GVHD prevention as compared to the other NK subsets. Ourin vitroresults indicate that CD11b+NK cells mediate suppression of DC induced T-cell proliferation (None). NoneNK cell subsets showed purity greater than 95%.
