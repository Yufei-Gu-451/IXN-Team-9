Our data in murine models revealed that the subset of c-Kit-CD27-CD11b+NK cells specifically mediates the highest anti-leukemic activities and the most potent GVHD amelioration via its migratory ability and efficient suppression of T-cell proliferation. Based on our previous findings that c-Kit+NK cells are capable of mediating diverse immunoregulatory functions in cancer and autoimmune disease,Nonewe first addressed the possible impact of c-Kit expressing NK cells on GVHD. NoneUnexpectedly, mice receiving freshly sorted (data not shown) or IL-18 induced c-Kit+CD27+CD11b-NK cells (called Kit+NK) showed a slight worsening of GVHD (None). Our data reveal that transfer of IL-2 expanded CD11b+NK cells delayed onset and reduced severity of acute GVHD in comparison to untreated GVHD controls or mice receiving IL-2 expanded CD27+NK cells, displaying a significantly reduced GVHD score as compared to the control group receiving BM and alloreactive T cells (BM+T; *p less than 0.05 on day 28) (None). Following our observation that IL-2 expanded CD11b+NK cells were the only NK cell subset that reduced acute GVHD, we aimed to exclude a possible negative impact on GVL effects. In contrast and of particular importance, mice treated with IL-2 expanded CD11b+NK cells showed efficient GVL response (None) accompanied by a significantly reduced GVHD and improved survival. To determine whether the favorable effect of the CD11b+NK cells in GVL and GVHD is predicted by specific genomic properties, we performed microarray analysis of the four major NK cell subsets that can be phenotypically distinguished by expression of the surface markers c-Kit, CD27 and CD11b (None). As illustrated inNone, when CD45.1+bulk NK cells isolated from splenocytes were transferred together with CD45.2+bone marrow cells into sublethally irradiated CD45.2+recipient mice, the subset of Kit+NK cells migrated to the bone marrow (BM), whereas CD11b+NK cells preferentially settled in peripheral organs such as spleen, blood, lung and intestinal tract (None,Fig. In line with this observation, BM of naive mice (before irradiation) also harbored very few CD11b+NK cells (Fig. Additionally, cytofluorimetric analysis following total body irradiation (TBI) and transfer of congenic BM allowed monitoring of the relative and absolute numbers of all the different NK cell subsets that repopulated the BM (Fig. In additional BLI experiments specifically performed with the CD11b+NK subset isolated from Luciferase-expressing transgenic mice (B6-L2G85.CD45.1), we confirmed the migration of the CD11b+NK cells to the GVHD target organs (Fig. Remarkably, in mice developing GVHD following allogeneic BMT plus T cell transfer, a failure in immune reconstitution with significantly reduced numbers of NK cells, specifically mature CD11b+NK cells, could be observed (Fig. As described above, the adoptive transfer of IL-2 expanded CD11b+NK cells delayed the onset and reduced the severity of acute GVHD, but preserved GVL (NoneandNone). Additionally, we performed time lapse video-microscopy to directly observe the killing of B16 tumor cells by the IL-2 expanded NK subsets over 12 h and were impressed by the velocity with which CD11b+NK cells could induce tumor cell death (Noneand unpublished data). We furthermore aimed to address the antitumor capacity of specifically the IL-2 expanded CD11b+NK cells against the allogeneic luc+BCL1 leukemia cell line. As shown inNone, the BLI signal was reduced in mice treated with IL-2 expanded CD11b+NK cells demonstrating their anti-leukemic capacityin vivo(NoneNoneNone). (B) Photographs from microscopy illustrating the tumor lytic effect induced by either IL-2 expanded CD27+or CD11b+NK cells on B16F10 tumor cells following 24 h of co-incubation. Indeed, donor CD11b+NK cells showed a significantly higher reduction of T-cell proliferation compared to CD27+NK cells in MLR performed with MoFlo sorted, IL-2 expanded donor NK cell subsets and CFSE labelled donor T cells stimulated by allogeneic DCs (None). Of note, while freshly sorted NK cell subsets lack GVHD-reducing effects in our experiments (unpublished data), IL-2 expanded CD11b+NK cells led to a significant reduction of GVHD (None). Of note, while the adoptive transfer of CD11b+NK cells delayed the onset and reduced the severity of acute GVHD, we observed support of the GVL reaction as assessed byin vivoBLI experiments addressing the expansion of luc+BCL1 leukemic cells in the setting of allogeneic BMT with or without induction of GVHD (NoneandNone). The overall modulation of GVHD by the subset of CD11b+NK cells corresponds well to the effects obtained by the whole NK cell pool following IL-2 stimulation as reported by Olson et al.
