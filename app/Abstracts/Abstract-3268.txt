ErbB2 is an attractive target for immunotherapy, as it is a tyrosine kinase receptor overexpressed on tumour cells of different origin, with a key role in the development of malignancy. Trastuzumab, the only humanised anti-ErbB2 antibody currently used in breast cancer with success, can engender cardiotoxicity and a high fraction of patients is resistant to Trastuzumab treatment. A novel human immunoRNase, called anti-Erb-hcAb-RNase retains the enzymatic activity of HP-RNase and specifically binds to ErbB2-positive cells with an affinity comparable with that of the parental Erb-hcAb. Moreover, this novel immunoRNase is endowed with an effective and selective antiproliferative action for ErbB2-positive tumour cells bothErb-hcAb-RNase could be a promising candidate for the immunotherapy of ErbB2-positive tumours.
