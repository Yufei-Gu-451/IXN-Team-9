A 28 amino-acid (aa) cell-penetrating peptide (p28) derived from azurin, a redox protein secreted from the opportunistic pathogenThe L1 loop (aa 112-124), a region within the S7-S8 loop (aa 214-236) and T140, P142, Q144, W146, R282 and L289 of the p53DBD were identified as potential sites for p28 binding. p28 decreased the level of the E3 ligase COP1 greater than 80%, in p53These data identify the specific motifs within the DBD of p53 that bind p28 and suggest that p28 inhibition of COP1 binding results in the sustained, post-translational increase in p53 levels and subsequent inhibition of cancer cell growth independent of an HDM2 pathway.
