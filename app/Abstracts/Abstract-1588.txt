The activity-regulated cytoskeletal protein Arc/Arg3.1 is required for long-term memory formation and synaptic plasticity. Arc expression is robustly induced by activity, and Arc protein localizes both to active synapses and the nucleus. While its synaptic function has been examined, it is not clear why or how Arc is localized to the nucleus. We found that murine Arc nuclear expression is regulated by synaptic activity
