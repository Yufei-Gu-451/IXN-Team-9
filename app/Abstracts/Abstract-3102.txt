11Beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11beta-HSD1) locally amplifies active glucocorticoids within specific tissues including in brain. In the hippocampus, 11beta-HSD1 messenger RNA increases with aging. Here, we report significantly greater increases in intrahippocampal corticosterone (CORT) levels in aged wild-type (WT) mice during the acquisition and retrieval trials in a Y-maze than age-matched 11beta-HSD1We followed intrahippocampal corticosterone (CORT) levels in mice during memory testing in a Y-maze. Aged 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11beta-HSD1A lower dynamic rise in intrahippocampal CORT levels associates with better memory. Acute stress increases intrahippocampal CORT and impairs memory in young mice. 11beta-HSD1 inhibition reduces intrahippocampal CORT and improves memory in aged mice.
