Despite recent advancements in therapy, melanoma still remains a highly lethal skin cancer. A better understanding of the genetic and epigenetic changes responsible for melanoma formation and progression could result in development of more effective treatments. Advanced melanomas are known to exhibit widespread promoter region CpG island methylation leading to inactivation of key tumor suppressor genes. Meta-analyses of relevant microarray data sets revealed the hematopoietic stem cell regulator gene Latexin (
