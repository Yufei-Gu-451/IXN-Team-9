The aim of this study was to evaluate whether diabetes (DM) and impaired fasting glucose (IFG) were associated with early alterations in left ventricular geometry and function in a large population of adolescents and young adults independently of major confounders. We analyzed echocardiographic data of 1,624 14- to 39-year-old participants (mean age 26.6 +/- 7.7 years; 57% female) without prevalent cardiovascular disease from the fourth Strong Heart Study examination; 179 (11%) participants had DM and 299 (18%) had IFG. Participants with DM and IFG were older and more often obese and hypertensive than participants with normal fasting glucose (NFG) (allIn a population of adolescents and young adults, DM is independently associated with early unfavorable cardiovascular phenotype characterized by increased left ventricular mass, concentric geometry, and early preclinical systolic and diastolic dysfunction; early cardiovascular alterations are also present in participants with prediabetes.
