Previous reports from our lab have shown that Skp2 is necessary for p27 degradation and cell cycle progression during adipocyte differentiation. Data presented here demonstrate that the anti-inflammatory, anti-obesity phytochemical curcumin blocked Skp2 protein accumulation during early adipocyte hyperplasia. In addition, curcumin dose-dependently induced p27 protein accumulation and G1 arrest of synchronously replicating 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Of note, p27 protein accumulation occurred in the presence of decreased p27 mRNA suggesting a role for post-transcriptional regulation. In support of this hypothesis, curcumin markedly increased p27 protein half-life as well as attenuated ubiquitin proteasome activity suggesting that inhibition of targeted p27 proteolysis occurred through curcumin-mediated attenuation of Skp2 and 26S proteasome activity. While we observed no cytotoxic effects for curcumin at doses less than 20 uM, it is important to note an increase in apoptotic signaling at concentrations greater than 30 uM. Finally, data presented here demonstrate that the anti-proliferative effect of curcumin was critical for the suppression of adipocyte differentiation and the development of the mature adipocyte. Collectively, our data demonstrate that curcumin-mediated post-transcriptional accumulation of p27 accounts in part for the anti-proliferative effect observed in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Curcumin inhibited early stages of adipogenesis during cell cycle progression. Curcumin increased p27 protein through post-translational mechanisms. Curcumin suppressed Skp2 protein which directs p27 ubiquitylation. p27 accumulation may account for late G1 arrest and suppression of adipogenesis. Potential mechanism regarding anti-obesity effects of curcumin.
