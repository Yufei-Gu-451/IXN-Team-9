To examine the role of hypertension, hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia in potentially accounting for obesity-related brain vulnerability in the form of altered cerebral neurochemistry. Sixty-four adults, ages 40 to 60 years, underwent a health screen and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (Higher BMI was significantly related to higher mI/Cr, independent of age and sex. BMI was also significantly related to two of the proposed mediators, triglyceride and HDL-cholesterol, which were also independently related to increased mI/Cr. Finally, the relationship between BMI and mI/Cr, was significantly attenuated after inclusion of triglyceride and HDL-cholesterol into the model, one at a time, indicating statistical mediation. Higher triglyceride and lower HDL levels statistically account for the association between BMI and
