Nasojejunal tube feeding is considered the current standard of care in patients with severe and critical acute pancreatitis. However, it is not known whether enteral nutrition is best delivered into the jejunum.

Development of a new conceptual framework is warranted to further advance nutritional management of patients with acute pancreatitis.
