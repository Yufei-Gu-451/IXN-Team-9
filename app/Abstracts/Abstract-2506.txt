NoneTo further enhance the efficacy of this treatment modality, a multimodal strategy has been developed that utilizes an oncolytic adenovirus containing two cytotoxic genes (Adv/CD-TK). NoneOne gene, cytosine deaminase (CD), converts the prodrug 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC) into 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and the other, herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-1 TK), converts ganciclovir (GCV) into ganciclovir monophosphate (GCV-MP). Long-term monitoring of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) kinetics suggests that some patients may develop antitumor immunity,Nonehowever, the immune mechanism has not been defined. GM-CSF, rather than IL-12, was evaluated because IL-12 may have direct cytolytic or anti-angiogenic effects to confound the analysis. Oncolytic adenoviral therapy may be streamlined and enhanced by substituting the suicide genes with immune modulating genes to synergize with ionizing radiation or other conventional therapy. The sensitivity of TUBO cells to 5-FU was tested by culturing TUBO cells with 5-FU at 0.1-100 mug/mL (None). Of the five mice receiving a single treatment of Adv/Luc, luciferase activity lasted 7 d in three mice while the remaining two sustained expression until day 11 (None, right panel). Tumor volume (None) and induction of antibodies to the tumor-associated antigen rat neu (None) were monitored. A significant reduction in tumor growth rate was observed when 24 mm3tumors were treated with Adv/CD-TK alone, but not when Adv/CD-TK was administered to 60 mm3tumors. The rapid clearance of the Adv/Luc which correlates with the induction of anti-adenoviral immunity is consistent with the limited therapeutic response with or without prodrug therapy. Adv/CD-TK/mGM-CSF (Adv/GM) encoding mouse GM-CSF was generated to test if the observed antitumor adaptive immunity can be enhanced. Wild-type BALB/c mice were inoculated s.c. with TUBO and were treated i.t. Anti-neu IgG levels were again higher in the Adv/GM group with a significant elevation in both IgG1 and IgG2a subclasses (Fig. All mice receiving Adv/GM were free from secondary tumor growth throughout the entire experiment (six weeks)(Fig. BALB/c mice were inoculated s.c. with D2F2/E2 on day 0. (C) HER2-specific IgG was measured in serum during the course of the experiment and (D) HER2 IgG subclasses were evaluated in serum samples at day 34. TUBO tumor-bearing mice treated with Adv/GM showed significantly delayed tumor growth compared to control group mice. injection of Adv itself induces immune reactivity to tumor-associated antigens and the encoded cytokine, GM-CSF, amplifies that immune response, resulting in tumor growth inhibition. In human trials, a synergistic effect between adenoviral therapy and ionizing radiation has been reported. NoneWhen Adv/CD-TK was used in a phase I study of prostate cancer, the treated patients were sensitized to radiation with extended time to disease progression when compared to radiation alone. NoneThe infectivity and subsequent oncolytic effect of Adv may be more substantial in humans to slow tumor growth. It may be reasonable to replace suicide genes with immune-modulating molecules, such as GM-CSF or IL-12 to amplify long-term immune protection while streamlining the treatment protocol. An adenovirus expressing luciferase (Adv/Luc) contains the transgene in the E3 region. BALB/c mice bearing ?50 mm3TUBO tumors were treated with 108PFU of Adv/Luc.
