Oncolytic viral therapy is an investigational cancer treatment that has generated considerable interest although its efficacy as a monotherapy may be limited. NoneTo further enhance the efficacy of this treatment modality, a multimodal strategy has been developed that utilizes an oncolytic adenovirus containing two cytotoxic genes (Adv/CD-TK). NoneOne gene, cytosine deaminase (CD), converts the prodrug 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC) into 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and the other, herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-1 TK), converts ganciclovir (GCV) into ganciclovir monophosphate (GCV-MP). Each cytotoxic gene system is expected to generate a local chemotherapeutic effect and sensitize cells to radiation. The toxicity and efficacy of this multimodal approach has been evaluated in five phase I/II trials of non-metastatic prostate cancer. NoneThe investigational therapy was well-tolerated and evidence of antitumor activity has emerged. We found that the antitumor effect elicited by Adv/CD-TK was modest and independent of suicide gene activity but that HER2/neu-specific adaptive immunity was induced and could be amplified by GM-CSF to render improved systemic protection. It was first necessary to test whether mouse mammary tumor cells can be infected by Adv to express the encoded transgene. These results established the sensitivity of mammary tumor cells to this suicide gene therapyin vitro. Tumor volume (None) and induction of antibodies to the tumor-associated antigen rat neu (None) were monitored. A significant reduction in tumor growth rate was observed when 24 mm3tumors were treated with Adv/CD-TK alone, but not when Adv/CD-TK was administered to 60 mm3tumors. Since TUBO cells are highly sensitive to anti-neu AbNoneinduction of neu-specific Ab by i.t. Intra-tumoral adenoviral therapy was further tested in the mouse mammary tumor cell line D2F2/E2. Adv/CD-TK therapy using two tumor models, and test the efficacy with GM-CSF gene expression. NoneThe resulting transcription of suicide genes may therefore be at a suboptimal levelin vivo, thus limiting the effects of prodrug therapy. Neu-specific Ab was significantly elevated in TUBO tumor bearing mice that received Adv/CD-TK with and without prodrug therapy. The delivery of the GM-CSF gene by Adv serves as an effective adjuvant. TUBO tumor-bearing mice treated with Adv/GM showed significantly delayed tumor growth compared to control group mice. In human trials, a synergistic effect between adenoviral therapy and ionizing radiation has been reported. NoneSeveral differences between the human trials and mouse mammary tumor studies may contribute to the outcome disparity. NoneThe infectivity and subsequent oncolytic effect of Adv may be more substantial in humans to slow tumor growth. Murine imaging and kinetics studies, however, demonstrate a rapid induction of anti-Adv immunity in Adv/CD-TK-treated naive mice and loss of transgene expression by 11 d after administration (None). Our previous report of IL-12 gene electrotransfer into the mouse mammary tumors also showed the induction of antitumor immunity and tumor rejection. The introduction of GM-CSF via the Adv vector promoted HER2/neu immunity and protected mice from secondary tumor challenge.
