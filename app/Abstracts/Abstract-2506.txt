(C) Toxicity of Adv/CD-TKin vitro. To test if Adv/CD-TK infection of mammary tumor cells enables the conversion of prodrugs 5-FC and GCV to their active, toxic forms, TUBO cells were infected with Adv/CD-TK at an MOI of 1 and incubated with 5-FC and GCV for 48 or 120 h, as previously reported (None). Maximal luciferase expression in all test mice was observed on day 3. (A) Viral transgene persistence was measured by i.t. Within 1 week of Adv/CD-TK injection, Adv-specific Ab was significantly elevated compared to controls (p= 0.038) and it persisted beyond the time when Adv/Luc was detectable by live imaging. Therefore, one time infection of naive mice with Adv/CD-TK promptly induced Adv immunity which may contribute to transient Adv persistence in mice. The ability of Adv/CD-TK itself, without the administration of prodrugs, to induce antitumor activity in TUBO tumor-bearing mice was assessed. three times, every other day with Adv/CD-TK at 108PFU (an estimated MOI of 1 based on tumor volume), without prodrugs. injections of Adv with the following drug dosing regimen. There was no significant difference between the groups in their tumor volume (None). Thus, addition of prodrug therapy did not reduce tumor growth. NoneNoneNoneIn vivotreatment with Adv/CD-TK and 5-FC/GCV prodrugs. (B) Tumor growth was monitored in mice treated as indicated in (A). NoneNoneNoneAdv/GM-CSF induces anti-tumor immunity associated with induction of neu-specific IgG2a antibody. Tumor growth was significantly lower in the Adv/GM group(Fig. Intra-tumoral adenoviral therapy was further tested in the mouse mammary tumor cell line D2F2/E2. Interferon gamma (IFNgamma) production, indicating HER2-specific T-cell activation, was significantly elevated in splenocytes from mice treated with Adv/GM after stimulation with E63 peptide vs. vehicle control (None). Neu-specific Ab was significantly elevated in TUBO tumor bearing mice that received Adv/CD-TK with and without prodrug therapy. Furthermore, Adv/GM therapy conferred complete protection against secondary tumor challenge. Murine imaging and kinetics studies, however, demonstrate a rapid induction of anti-Adv immunity in Adv/CD-TK-treated naive mice and loss of transgene expression by 11 d after administration (None). To determine if tumor immunity can be further enhanced, Adv/CD-TK expressing IL-12 was tested in a preclinical model of prostate cancer. Our previous report of IL-12 gene electrotransfer into the mouse mammary tumors also showed the induction of antitumor immunity and tumor rejection. Thus, tumor immunity induced by Adv is enhanced and tilted toward Th1 by GM-CSF to support the strategy of incorporating immune-modulating genes in Adv vectors. The present study provides an improved understanding of the immune response to i.t.
