Early identification of hip fracture (HF) patients bearing an increased risk for a contralateral occurrence would allow providing preventive measures timely. To summarize the available evidence describing risk scores, prognostic instruments, or (groups of) parameters predicting contralateral HFs at the time point of the first fracture. Searches identified 3560 records, and 47 studies were included in this review. There was a large spectrum of study designs, patient populations, and follow-up periods. Among 11 studies reporting on a set of parameters, female gender was assessed most commonly (7 times), followed by age (5) and parameters of general health, vision, and stroke (each 4 times). We were unable to depict stringent patterns of risk parameters to be used for decision making in clinical practice. The findings of this article call for a conjoint effort to achieve an expert consensus regarding a critical set of parameters for a risk instrument identifying patients bearing an increased risk for contralateral HFs early.
