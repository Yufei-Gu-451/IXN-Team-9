Crossmodal integration is a term applicable to many phenomena in which one sensory modality influences task performance or perception in another sensory modality. We distinguish the term binding as one that should be reserved specifically for the process that underpins perceptual object formation. To unambiguously differentiate binding form other types of integration, behavioral and neural studies must investigate perception of a feature orthogonal to the features that link the auditory and visual stimuli. We argue that supporting true perceptual binding (as opposed to other processes such as decision-making) is one role for cross-sensory influences in early sensory cortex. These early multisensory interactions may therefore form a physiological substrate for the bottom-up grouping of auditory and visual stimuli into auditory-visual (AV) objects. Crossmodal integration and binding have been treated as synonymous in the literature, with no clear delineation between perceptual changes and other interactions such as decision-making. Crossmodal binding is proposed as a distinct form of integration leading to multisensory object formation. Multisensory stimuli are most beneficial in noisy situations, but few studies use stimulus competition to investigate the processes underpinning multisensory integration. Evidence suggests that both visual and auditory attention is object-based - all features within an object are enhanced and there is a cost to attending features across versus within objects. Multisensory interactions can be observed throughout the brain, including early sensory cortex. The role of early sensory cortex in multisensory integration is unknown, but may underlie crossmodal binding.
