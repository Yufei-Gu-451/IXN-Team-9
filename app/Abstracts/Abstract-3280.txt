The clinical course of World Health Organisation grade II gliomas remains variable and their time point of transformation into a more malignant phenotype is unpredictable. Identification of biological markers that can predict prognosis in individual patients is of great clinical value. PROX1 is a transcription factor that has a critical role in the development of various organs. PROX1 has been ascribed both oncogenic and tumour suppressive functions in human cancers. We have recently shown that PROX1 may act as a diagnostic marker for high-grade gliomas. The aim of this study was to address the prognostic value of PROX1 in grade II gliomas. A total of 116 samples were evaluated for the presence of PROX1 protein. The number of immunopositive cells was used as a variable in survival analysis, together with established prognostic factors for this patient group. Higher PROX1 protein was associated with poor outcome. In the multivariate analysis, PROX1 was identified as an independent factor for survival (PROX1 is a novel predictor of survival for grade II gliomas.
