Fatty liver disease (FLD) is characterized by increased intrahepatic triglyceride content with or without inflammation and is associated with obesity, and features of the metabolic syndrome. Several recent GWAS have reported an association between SNP rs738409 in theWe investigated whether missense rs738409We used linear regression to test the additive effect of genotype, abdominal visceral adipose tissue (VAT), and their multiplicative interaction on LA adjusted for age, BMI, HDL-cholesterol, insulin resistance, serum triglycerides, abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue, and alcohol intake. In men and women combined, the interaction between each copy of the rs738409 variant allele (MAF 0.23) and 100cmThe interaction between genotype and VAT volume suggest key differences in the role of
