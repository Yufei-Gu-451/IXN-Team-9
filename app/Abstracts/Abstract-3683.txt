The activation of the complement system may be involved in the pathology of myocardial infarction (MI) and type 2 diabetes. To explore their potential as prognostic markers, we characterized two factors in the complement cascade, the end product sC5b-9 and the mannose-binding lectin-associated Ser protease-2 (MASP-2), in type 2 diabetic patients with suspected MI. Plasma sC5b-9 and MASP-2 were determined in patients with MI and type 2 diabetes (The median sC5b-9 was 134 mug/L (interquartile range [IQR] 101-190 mug/L) and the median MASP-2 was 333 mug/L (IQR 235-463 mug/L), with no significant correlation between them. Women had higher sC5b-9 than men (median 152 vs. 130 mug/L;In type 2 diabetic patients with MI, high levels of sC5b-9 predict future CVE. This indicates that the complement system may play a significant role in the pathology of the subsequent myocardial damage and that the pathways leading to complement activation warrant further exploration as potential therapeutic targets to improve the prognosis for these patients.
