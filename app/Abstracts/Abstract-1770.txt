To determine the correlates of the "metabolically healthy obese" (MHO) phenotype and the longitudinal risks of diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD)/stroke associated with this phenotype. The North West Adelaide Health Study is a prospective cohort study of 4,056 randomly selected adults aged greater than =18 years. Participants free of CVD/stroke and not underweight (Correlates of the MHO ("Healthy" obesity was a transient state for one-third of subjects. Persistence of a MHO phenotype, which was associated with favorable outcomes, was related to younger age and a more peripheral fat distribution. The MHO phenotype may be sustained by promoting lower waist circumferences.
