Since the tissue of children with combined pituitary hormone deficiency (CPHD) is not readily accessible, a new focus in children with CPHD is the blood-based expression profiling of non-protein coding genes, such as microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs), which regulate gene expression by inhibiting the translation of mRNAs. In this study, to address this, we identified potential miRNA signatures for CPHD by comparing genome-wide miRNA expression profiles in the serum of children with CPHD vs. normal (healthy) controls. Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were transfected with miR-593 or miR-511 oligonucleotides. Potential target gene expression was validated by western blot analysis for proteins and by miR-593 or miR-511 reporter assay using
