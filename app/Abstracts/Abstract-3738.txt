The physiological control of feeding behavior involves modulation of the intake inhibitory effects of gastrointestinal satiation signaling via endogenous hindbrain leptin receptor (LepR) and glucagon-like-peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) activation. Using a variety of dose-combinations of hindbrain delivered (4Collectively, the findings reported here show that hindbrain LepR and GLP-1R activation interact in at least an additive fashion to control food intake and body weight. As evidence is accumulating that combination pharmacotherapies offer greater sustained food intake and body weight suppression in obese individuals when compared to mono-drug therapies or lifestyle modifications alone, these findings highlight the need for further examination of combined CNS GLP-1R and LepR signaling as a potential drug target for obesity treatment.
