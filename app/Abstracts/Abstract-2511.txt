Adenosine triphosphate (ATP), an essential metabolic energy source, is released following cell apoptosis or necrosis. It acts as a damage-associated molecule pattern to stimulate innate immune cells. The ectonucleotidase CD39 regulates immune activation by hydrolysis of extracellular ATP. We have shown previously that CD39 expression by donor livers helps protect syngeneic grafts with extended (24 hr) cold preservation time from ischemia reperfusion injury. Given its immune regulatory properties, we hypothesized that CD39 expression in donor livers might modulate transplant tolerance that occurs following mouse allogeneic liver transplantation (LTx). Livers from C57BL/6 (B6) wild-type (WT) or CD39 KO mice were transplanted into normal C3H recipients with minimal (approximately 1 hr) cold ischemia. Serum alanine aminotransferase levels at day 4 post LTx were significantly higher in animals given CD39KO compared with WT livers. Moreover, IFN-gamma production by liver-infiltrating CD8
