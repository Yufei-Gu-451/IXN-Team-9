These observations suggest an enhanced potential of CD39KO liver DCs to stimulate host T cell responses and thus enhanced immunogenicity of CD39-deficient liver allografts. To examine the role of CD39 expression by donor tissue in mouse MHC-mismatched orthotopic liver transplantation, we grafted WT or CD39KO livers into normal C3H recipients and euthanized the recipients at day 4 after LTx. To explore mechanisms underlying the enhanced acute rejection of CD39KO livers, we examined immune cell populations in allografts and recipient spleens at day 4 after LTx. Similarly to the liver grafts, spleens of CD39KO transplant recipients displayed significantly less Treg than those of WT livers (WT: 30.0+/-3.92% vs CD39KO: 24.9+/-1.3%; p less than 0.05) (Figure 2A C). These data suggest that reduced Treg in CD39KO liver transplants may be causally related to the more severe inflammation and tissue injury observed in these grafts. Moreover, the incidence of CD8+IFN-gamma+cells was increased significantly in CD39KO livers compared with WT grafts (WT: 38.8+/-1.7% vs CD39KO: 46.6+/-4.4%; p less than 0.05) (Figure 3 B C). Mouse WT liver allografts are accepted without immunosuppressive therapy. [7] We determined WT and CD39KO liver allograft survival to assess the impact of CD39 deficiency in donor tissue on mouse liver transplant tolerance. Furthermore, CD39 deficiency is associated with a more mature liver DC phenotype and CD39 expression by liver DC plays an important role in regulating the pathogenesis of liver cold I/R injury after syngeneic liver transplantation [40]. In the present study, in which we hypothesized that CD39 might contribute to liver allograft tolerance after LTx, ischemia time was limited to 1 hr and graft injury and histology were examined 4 days post-transplant. Furthermore, sCD39 administration partially reversed allograft rejection in CD39KO liver recipients. Other mechanisms that are not restored by sCD39 may promote indefinite liver allograft survival. Treg regulate immune responses and contribute to liver allograft tolerance [14]. Furthermore, sCD39 administration partially reverses acute rejection in CD39KO liver recipients.
