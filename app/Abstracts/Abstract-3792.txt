The autoimmune liver disease primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is associated with life-altering fatigue in ?50% of patients. Previous work suggests that fatigued PBC subjects have evidence of autonomic dysfunction and may be at a higher risk of sudden cardiac death. The manifestation of this risk is not clear. This pilot study investigated whether alterations in cardiac torsion and strain could be detected in fatigued or nonfatigued early-stage PBC patients. We performed cardiac tissue tagging and anatomical cine-imaging in 13 early-stage PBC patients (including 7 with significant fatigue) and 10 control subjects to calculate cardiac torsion and strain throughout systole and diastole. From the cardiac tagging, we calculated the torsion-to-shortening ratio (TSR), a measure of subepicardial torsion exerting mechanical advantage over subendocardial shortening. Autonomic function testing was performed to evaluate baroreceptor effective index on standing. TSR was markedly increased in the fatigued PBC patients (0.70 +/- 0.13) compared with both controls (0.46 +/- 0.11,
