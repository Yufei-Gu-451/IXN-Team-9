To determine whether a selective increase of visceral adipose tissue content will result in insulin resistance. Sympathetic denervation of the omental fat was performed under general inhalant anesthesia by injecting 6-hydroxydopamine in the omental fat of lean mongrel dogs (n=11). In the conscious animal, whole-body insulin sensitivity was assessed by the minimal model (Denervation of omental fat resulted in increased percentage (and content) of visceral fat [Wk0: 10.2% (8.5-11.4); Wk2: 12.4% (10.4-13.6); P less than 0.01]. Abdominal subcutaneous fat remained unchanged. However, we found no changes inDespite a selective increase in visceral adiposity in dogs, insulin sensitivity
