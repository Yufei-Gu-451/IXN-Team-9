Emerging data implicate activation of the complement cascade in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the relationships between components of the complement system, metabolic risk factors, and family history of type 2 diabetes in healthy South Asians. We recruited 119 healthy, first-degree relatives of South Asian subjects with type 2 diabetes (SARs) and 119 age- and sex-matched, healthy South Asian control subjects (SACs). Fasting blood samples were taken for measurement of complement factors and standard metabolic risk factors. SARs were characterized by significantly higher properdin (mean concentration 12.6 [95% CI 12.2-13.1] mg/L vs. SACs 10.1 [9.7-10.5] mg/L,Increased properdin and complement activation are associated with a family history of type 2 diabetes in South Asians independent of insulin resistance, and predate the development of impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance. Properdin and SC5b-9 may be novel biomarkers for future risk of type 2 diabetes in this high-risk population and warrant further investigation.
