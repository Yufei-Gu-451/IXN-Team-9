Variant-specific zinc transporter 8 autoantibodies (ZnT8A) against either arginine (R) or tryptophan (W) at amino acid (aa) position 325 of the zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8) has been identified in type 1 diabetes (T1D) patients. Reciprocal cross-over tests revealed differences in half-maximal binding to indicate variable affinity of patient ZnT8 autoantibodies. Insufficient recombinant ZnT8 variant proteins have precluded detailed analyses of ZnT8 autoantibody affinity. The aims in the present study were to (i) generate recombinant ZnT8R- and ZnT8W-aa275-369 proteins; (ii) test the ZnT8R- and ZnT8W-aa275-369 proteins in reciprocal competitive radiobinding assays (RBA) against ZnT8R- and ZnT8W-aa268-369 labelled with
