To perform a randomized trial to determine if there is cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk reduction from a plant-based no added fat diet (PB) and the American Heart Association Diet (AHA) in children. Four-week (4/20/2013-5/18/2013) prospective randomized trial in a large Midwestern hospital system's predominantly middle class outpatient pediatric practices. Thirty children (9-18 years old) parent pairs with a last recorded child BMI greater than 95Children on PB had nine and children on AHA had four statistically significant (P less than 0.05) beneficial changes from baseline (mean decreases): BMI Z-scorePB and the AHA in both children and adults demonstrated potentially beneficial changes from baseline in risk factors for CVD. Future larger, long-term randomized trials with easily accessible PB foods will further define the role of the PB in preventing CVD.
