Transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) can act either as a tumor promoter or a tumor suppressor in a context-dependent manner. High levels of TGFbeta are found in prostate cancer tissues and correlate with poor patient prognosis. We recently identified a novel TGFbeta-regulated signaling cascade in which TGFbeta type I receptor (TbetaRI) is activated by the E3 ligase TNF-receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) via the Lys63-linked polyubiquitination of TbetaRI. TRAF6 also contributes to activation of TNF-alpha-converting enzyme and presenilin-1, resulting in the proteolytic cleavage of TbetaRI and releasing the intracellular domain of TbetaRI, which is translocated to the nucleus to promote tumor invasiveness. In this report, we provide evidence that Lys178 of TbetaRI is polyubiquitinated by TRAF6. Moreover, our data suggest that TRAF6-mediated Lys63-linked ubiquitination of the TbetaRI intracellular domain is a prerequisite for TGFbeta regulation of mRNA for cyclin D1 (
