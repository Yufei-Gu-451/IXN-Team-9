To evaluate patient-level glycemic control and facility variation of a proposed out-of-range (OOR) measure (overtreatment [OT] [HbAVeterans Health Administration patients greater than =65 years of age in 2012 who were taking antihyperglycemic agents in 2013 were identified. Patient-level rates and facility-level rates/rankings were calculated by age and comorbid illness burden. We identified 303,097 patients who were taking antiglycemic agents other than metformin only. The study population comprised 193,689 patients with at least one significant medical, neurological, or mental health condition; 98.2% were taking a sulfonylurea and/or insulin; 55.2% were aged 65-75 years; and 44.8% were aged greater than 75 years. The 47.4% of patients 65-75 years met the OOR measure (33.4% OT, 14% UT), and 65.7% met the SM. For patients aged greater than 75 years, rates were 48.1% for OOR (39.2% OT; 8.9% UT) and 73.2% for SM. Facility-level rates for OOR for patients aged 65-75 years ranged from 33.7 to 60.4% (median 47.4%), with a strong inverse correlation (rho = -0.41) between SM and OOR performance rankings. Among the best-performing 20% facilities on the SM, 14 of 28 ranked in the worst-performing 20% on the OOR measure; 12 of 27 of the worst-performing 20% facilities on the SM ranked in the best-performing 20% on the OOR measure. Facility rankings that are based on an SM (potential benefits) and OOR measure (potential risks) differ substantially. An OOR for high-risk populations can focus quality improvement on individual patient evaluation to reduce the risk for short-term harms.
