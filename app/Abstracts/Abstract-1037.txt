Pregnancy in type 1 diabetes requires excellent glycemic control. Most pregnant type 1 diabetic women achieve normoglycemia; however, there is scarce data on their postdelivery characteristics. We aimed to examine postpregnancy glycemic control and weight changes in type 1 diabetes. We identified and followed (median 20 months) 254 women with singleton pregnancies receiving postdelivery medical care at a single institution. Study subjects were 28.3 +/- 4.7 years of age (mean +/- SD), with a diabetes duration of 12.0 +/- 7.7 years. Mean A1C before conception was 6.9 +/- 1.4%, and preconception weight and BMI were 64.4 +/- 10.0 kg and 23.9 +/- 3.3 kg/mIn this clinical observation, type 1 diabetic women showed postpregnancy deterioration in glycemic control and were unable to return to prepregnancy weight. Type 1 diabetic women seem to require special attention after delivery to meet therapeutic targets.
