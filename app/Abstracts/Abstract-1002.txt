The purpose of this analysis was to determine whether there are significant differences in presentation, clinicopathologic features, treatment, and survival rates between non-Hispanic white (NHW) and Asian; and between Asian subgroups in patients with CRC. The purpose of this analysis was to determine whether there are significant differences in presentation, clinicopathologic features, treatment, and survival rates between non-Hispanic white (NHW) and Asian; and between Asian subgroups in patients with CRC. Overweight and obesity proportions in Asian subgroups were much lower than in NHW (Table 3). Advance tumour stages were highly associated with worse DSS in each ethnicity group. We also found that Indian/Pakistani patients had better DSS than did other groups even after adjusted by age, tumour stage, grade, and tumour site. Obese patients have a 50% increased risk of developing CRC and a 30% higher risk of dying from CRC than non-obese patients (CalleNone, 2003). According to our study, overweight and obesity proportions in Asian subgroups were much lower than in NHW. In contrast to the decreasing trends in CRC incidence reported among all major racial/ethnic groups, CRC rates are actually increasing among some Asian subgroups, including the Korean population (GiddingsNone, 2012).
