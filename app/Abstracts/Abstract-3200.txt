Diabetes is prevalent among solid organ transplant recipients and is universal among islet transplant recipients. Whereas diabetes is often considered to result in an immune-compromised state, the impact of chronic hyperglycemia on host alloimmunity is not clear. Potential immune-modifying effects of obesity, autoimmunity, or diabetogenic agents like streptozotocin may confound understanding alloimmunity in experimental models of diabetes. Therefore, we sought to determine the role of chronic hyperglycemia due to insulinopenia on alloimmunity using the nonautoimmune, spontaneously diabetic H-2
