The Leydig tumor cell line, MA-10, expresses the luteinizing hormone receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor that, when activated with luteinizing hormone or chorionic gonadotropin (CG), stimulates cAMP production and subsequent steroidogenesis, notably progesterone. These cells also respond to epidermal growth factor (EGF) and phorbol esters with increased steroid biosynthesis. In order to probe the intracellular pathways along with heterologous receptor down-regulation and cellular desensitization, cells were preincubated with EGF or phorbol esters and then challenged with CG, EGF, dibutryl-cyclic AMP, and a phorbol ester. Relative receptor numbers, steroid biosynthesis, and expression of the early response genes,Leydig tumor cells respond to hCG, cAMP, EGF, and phorbol esters with increased steroidogenesis. These same agents increase expression of the early response genesDown-regulation of EGF receptors reduced hCG receptors and steroidogenesis. Desensitization of the PKC pathway reduced hCG receptors and steroidogenesis. Often expression of
