Release of CaCASQ2-RyR2 regulation was examined at the single RyR2 channel level. Single RyR2s were incorporated into planar lipid bilayers by the fusion of native SR vesicles isolated from either wild-type (WT), CASQ2 knockout (KO), or R33Q-CASQ2 knock-in (KI) mice. KO and KI mice have CPVT-like phenotypes. We show that CASQ2(WT) action on RyR2 function (either activation or inhibition) was strongly influenced by the presence of cytosolic MgATP. Function of the reconstituted CASQ2(WT)-RyR2 complex was unaffected by changes in luminal free [Ca
