Activation of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappaB) results in its translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and binding to the promoters of a large number of genes, including those encoding proinflammatory cytokines and other mediators that can contribute to organ system dysfunction in severe infection. While inhibition of NF-kappaB activation has been proposed as a therapeutic approach in critical illness, several studies have indicated that such an approach may have deleterious effects in persistent infectious states, such as pneumonia. A new report from Devaney and colleagues shows that while inhibition of NF-kappaB may be useful in severe pneumonia associated with rapid progression to mortality, it leads to worsened pulmonary injury with increased bacterial numbers in the lungs in a model of prolonged pneumonia. Such data raise concerns about therapeutic approaches targeting NF-kappaB in critically ill patients with persistent infection.
