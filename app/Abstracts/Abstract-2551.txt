Sestrin proteins have been implicated in multiple biological processes including resistance to oxidative and genotoxic stresses, protection against aging-related pathologies, and promotion of metabolic homeostasis; however, the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. Some evidence suggests that sestrins may inhibit mTORC1 (mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1) through inhibition of RagA/B GTPases or activation of AMPK; however, whether sestrins are also involved in mTORC2 regulation and function is unclear. To investigate the functions and mechanisms of Sestrin 3 (Sesn3), we generated
