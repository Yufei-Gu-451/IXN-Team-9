Impaired parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system activity have been demonstrated in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and correlated with worse prognosis. Few data are available on the effect of DM on cardiac neuropathy in heart failure (HF). The aim of the current study was to assess cardiac sympathetic activity in HF patients with and without DM. Patients with severe HF (DM compared with non-DM patients showed significantly lower early (1.65 +/- 0.21 vs. 1.75 +/- 0.21;Diabetic patients with HF show lower cardiac sympathetic activity than HF patients not having DM or than DM patients with a similar degree of autonomic dysfunction not having HF.
