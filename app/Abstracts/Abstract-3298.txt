To characterise recurrence patterns and survival following pathologic complete response (pCR) in patients who received preoperative therapy for localised gastric or gastrooesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma. A retrospective review of a prospective database identified patients with pCR after preoperative chemotherapy for gastric or preoperative chemoradiation for GEJ (Siewert II/III) adenocarcinoma. Recurrence patterns, overall survival, recurrence-free survival, and disease-specific survival were analysed. From 1985 to 2009, 714 patients received preoperative therapy for localised gastric/GEJ adenocarcinoma, and 609 (85%) underwent a subsequent R0 resection. There were 60 patients (8.4%) with a pCR. Median follow-up was 46 months. Recurrence at 5 years was significantly lower for pCRPatients with gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma who achieve a pCR following preoperative therapy still have a significant risk of recurrence and cancer-specific death following resection. One third of the recurrences in the pCR group were symptomatic CNS recurrences. Increased awareness of the risk of CNS metastases and selective brain imaging in patients who achieve a pCR following preoperative therapy for gastric/GEJ adenocarcinoma is warranted.
