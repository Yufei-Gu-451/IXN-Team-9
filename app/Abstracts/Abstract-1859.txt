Comprehensive analysis of the intranuclear territories and motion of budding yeast chromosome XII loci suggests that long-range chromosome architecture is mainly determined by the physical principles of polymers. Chromosomes architecture is viewed as a key component of gene regulation, but principles of chromosomal folding remain elusive. Here we used high-throughput live cell microscopy to characterize the conformation and dynamics of the longest chromosome of
