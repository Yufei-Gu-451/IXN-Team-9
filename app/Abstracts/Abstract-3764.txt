The 40S ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) is an important regulator of cell growth. Expression of S6K1 is often elevated in breast cancer cells. However, the transcriptional mechanism of S6K1 overexpression is not understood. In this report, we demonstrate that estrogen activates expression of S6K1 via Estrogen Receptor (ER) alpha in ER-positive breast cancer cells. We also show that estrogen acts on the proximal promoter of the S6K1 gene in a mechanism involving the transcriptional factor GATA-3. Finally, we provide data that support the importance of estrogenic regulation of S6K1 expression in breast cancer cell proliferation. S6K1 directly phosphorylates and regulates ligand-independent activity of ERalpha, while ERalpha upregulates S6K1 expression. This S6K1-ERalpha relationship creates a positive feed-forward loop in control of breast cancer cell proliferation. Furthermore, the co-dependent association between S6K1 and ERalpha may be exploited in the development of targeted breast cancer therapies.
