High circulating neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) appears to be prognostic in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). We investigated the relationship of NLR with circulating cytokines and molecular alterations. We performed retrospective analyses on multiple cohorts of CRC patients (metastatic untreated (High NLR was associated with poor prognosis in mCRC (hazard ratio (HR) 1.73; 95% confidence interval (CI):1.03-2.89;High NLR is an independent poor prognostic marker in CRC and correlates with a distinct cytokine profile related to key biological processes involved in carcinogenesis. A composite NLR-cytokine stratification has enhanced prognostic value in mCRC.
