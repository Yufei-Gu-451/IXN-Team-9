Osteoradionecrosis is one of the most serious complications of patients receiving radiation therapy. It is characterized by hypovascularity, hypocellularity, and hypoxia-inducing necrosis of bone and soft tissue following delayed healing. In this case, a 72-year-old man was referred to the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery complaining of trismus following extraction three months before first visit. He had a history of right tonsillectomy, radical neck dissection and radiotherapy performed due to right tonsillar cancer seven years prior. After the diagnosis of osteoradionecrosis on right mandibular body and angle, conservative antibiotic therapy was used first, but an orocutaneous fistula gradually formed, and extensive bony destruction and sequestrum were observed. Sequestrectomy, free particulated iliac bone and umbilical fat pad graft were performed via a submandibular approach under general anesthesia. Preoperative regular exams and delicate wound care led to secondary healing of the wound without vascularized free flap reconstruction.
