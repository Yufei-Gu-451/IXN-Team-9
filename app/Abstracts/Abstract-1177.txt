Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is used to monitor brain and kidney perfusion in at-risk premature and term neonates. Although NIRS holds potential for bedside monitoring of intestinal perfusion, there is insufficient evidence showing correlation with mesenteric blood flow. To determine if an association exists between abdominal regional oxygen saturation (A-rSOA-rSOChange in A-rSOIn very preterm infants, A-rSO
