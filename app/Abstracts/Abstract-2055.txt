N-methyl-d-aspartate glutamate receptors (NMDARs) are classically known as coincidence detectors for the induction of long-term synaptic plasticity, and have been implicated in hippocampal CA3-dependent spatial memory functions that likely rely on dynamic cellular ensemble encoding of space. The unique functional properties of both NMDARs and mossy fiber (MF) projections to CA3 pyramidal cells place MF-NMDARs in a prime position to influence CA3 ensemble dynamics. By mimicking pre and postsynaptic activity patterns observed
