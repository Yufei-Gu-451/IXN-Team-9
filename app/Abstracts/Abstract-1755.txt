To determine the prevalence of people with diabetes who meet hemoglobin AData were cross-sectional from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) from 1988-1994, 1999-2002, 2003-2006, and 2007-2010. Participants were 4,926 adults aged greater than =20 years who self-reported a previous diagnosis of diabetes and completed the household interview and physical examination (In 2007-2010, 52.5% of people with diabetes achieved A1C less than 7.0% ( less than 53 mmol/mol), 51.1% achieved BP less than 130/80 mmHg, 56.2% achieved LDL less than 100 mg/dL, and 18.8% achieved all three ABCs. These levels of control were significant improvements from 1988 to 1994 (allDespite significant improvement during the past decade, achieving the ABC goals remains suboptimal among adults with diabetes, particularly in some minority groups. Substantial opportunity exists to further improve diabetes control and, thus, to reduce diabetes-related morbidity and mortality.
