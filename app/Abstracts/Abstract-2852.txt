Regulator of cullins-1 (ROC1) is a key subunit in the cullin-RING ligase (CRL) protein complex. Our previous study indicated that ROC1 was essential for bladder cancer cell survival and that ROC1 knockdown inhibited CRL activity, triggering G2 phase arrest and senescence. However, the role of ROC1 in the malignant progression of bladder cancer remained unknown. ROC1 expression in cancer cells was knocked down by siRNA silencing. The effects of ROC1 silencing were evaluated byROC1 knockdown suppresses bladder cancer cell migration by inhibiting EMT. ROC1 knockdown inhibited EMT by inhibiting mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity via the accumulation of the mTOR-inhibitory protein DEPTOR, a CRL substrate. DEPTOR knockdown partially rescued ROC1 knockdown-inhibited EMT and the ROC1-induced inhibition of cancer cell migration. Furthermore,ROC1 has an important role in the malignant progression of bladder cancer via the mTOR/DEPTOR pathway. ROC1 may serve as a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of muscle-invasive transitional cell carcinoma.
