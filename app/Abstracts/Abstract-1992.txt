To evaluate cerebral hemodynamics during dopamine treatment in hypotensive (mean arterial blood pressure [MABP] less than gestational age) ELBW infants. Continuous monitoring of cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFv), MABP, and PCOFifteen hypotensive ELBW infants (625 +/- 174 g; 24 [23 to 24.8] weeks) were studied. Mean CBFv increased from 10.9 +/- 3.7 to 15.7 +/- 5.7 cm/s (Mean CBFv increased pressure-passively as MABP was optimized by dopamine treatment in very sick hypotensive ELBW infants on the first day of life.
