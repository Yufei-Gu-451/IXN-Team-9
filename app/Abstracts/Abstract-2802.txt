Carcinoma of the external auditory canal presents a challenge in management, largely due to limited experience in treating this rare disease and the lack of a universally accepted staging system. Prognosis is most dependent on the extent of local disease at presentation, while resection margin status is also a strong determinant of survival in post-operative patients. The intent of this pictorial essay is to review the pattern of tumour spread and highlight the value of imaging, particularly magnetic resonance imaging in pre-operative tumour mapping.
