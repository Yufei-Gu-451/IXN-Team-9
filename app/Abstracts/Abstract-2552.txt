Stimulation of endogenous beta-cell expansion could facilitate regeneration in patients with diabetes. In mice, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is expressed in embryonic beta-cells and in adult beta-cells during periods of expansion. We discovered that in embryos CTGF is necessary for beta-cell proliferation, and increased CTGF in beta-cells promotes proliferation of immature (MafA
