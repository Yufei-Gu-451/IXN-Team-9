The Algorithm Testing and Evaluation Program for Coordinate Measurement Systems (ATEP-CMS) is a Special Test Service offered under the NIST Calibration Program. ATEP-CMS evaluates the performance of geometric fitting software used in coordinate measurement systems. It is a Special Test because it is a new type of NIST service, experimental in nature and unsupported by historical data. This report documents and explains the rationale of the performance measures used in ATEP-CMS and analyzes the uncertainties of those measures.
