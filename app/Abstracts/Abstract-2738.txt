This article describes the features on sonography, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of mucinous tubular and spindle cell carcinoma of the kidney. Six pathologically proven cases of mucinous tubular and spindle cell carcinoma of the kidney were identified (5 females, 1 male); all patients underwent preoperative imaging. The mean age of the patients was 58.5 years. Thirteen imaging studies were available for review: 2 sonograms, 1 unenhanced CT scan, 5 contrast-enhanced CT scans, 1 unenhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination, and 4 contrast-enhanced MRI examinations. Two abdominal radiologists evaluated all images retrospectively on a PACS workstation using a standardized data collection sheet until consensus was reached. All mucinous tubular and spindle cell carcinomas presented as well-marginated, small (mean 2.6 cm, range 1.9-3.2 cm) predominantly solid masses. No intratumoral fat or calcification was identified. Unenhanced CT and MRI appearances were variable as was the degree of enhancement following intravenous contrast material administration. There was no evidence of perinephric extension, renal vein involvement or metastatic disease in any of the cases. The radiological appearance of mucinous tubular and spindle cell carcinoma is diverse and therefore indistinguishable from the more common subtypes of renal cell carcinoma.
