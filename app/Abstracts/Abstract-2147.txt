Disease-associated T-cell autoreactivities are seen in most type 1 diabetic patients and are thought to emerge before islet autoantibodies, but host factors that impact autoimmune elements remain uncertain. We assessed if adiposity and measures of insulin sensitivity impact T- and B-cell autoimmunity in children with insulin-requiring diabetes. Insulin-requiring children and adolescents diagnosed between January 2004 and June 2008 were studied (All but one subject had either T- or B-cell autoimmunity. Diabetes-associated T-cell autoreactivities were found in 92% of subjects. Higher amplitude T-cell autoreactivities to neuronal diabetes-associated autoantigens were seen in those with the highest BMIz quintile, BMI greater than =85th percentile (Our observations link obesity and diabetes-related autoimmunity, suggesting an amplification of neuronal T-cell autoimmunity associated with adiposity and/or insulin resistance, with obesity-related inflammation possibly enhancing islet autoimmunity.
