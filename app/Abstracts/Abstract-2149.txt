To evaluate 3- and 6-month weight-loss outcomes achieved when physicians refer overweight/obese patients to an automated 3-month Internet-based behavioral weight-loss intervention. A total of 154 patients age 18-70 years with a BMI between 25 and 45 kg/mIn intent-to-treat analyses with baseline weight carried forward for missing data, IBI produced significantly larger mean (SD) weight losses than IDEA at 3 months (5.5 kg [4.4] vs. 1.3 kg [2.1]) and 6 months (5.4 kg [5.6] vs. 1.3 kg [4.1]) (Physician referral to an Internet-based behavioral weight-loss intervention produced clinically significant weight loss for over half of the patients studied. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of implementing this intervention more broadly within diverse health care settings.
