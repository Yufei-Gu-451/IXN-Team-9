Several studies showed low bone mineral density (BMD) and elevated risk of symptomatic fractures in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D). To our knowledge, there has been no investigation on the prevalence of asymptomatic vertebral fractures (VFx) in T1D. In the current study, we assessed BMD and the prevalence of VFx in T1D. We evaluated 82 T1D patients (26 males and 56 females, aged 31.1 +/- 8.6 years, BMI 23.5 +/- 3.3 kg/mT1D patients had lower Z-LS and Z-FN than controls (-0.55 +/- 1.3 vs. 0.35 +/- 1.0,T1D patients have low BMD and elevated prevalence of asymptomatic VFx, which is associated with the presence of T1D independently of BMD.
