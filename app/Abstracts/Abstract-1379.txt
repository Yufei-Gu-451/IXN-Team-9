Molecular pathways determining the malignant potential of premalignant breast lesions remain unknown. In this study, alterations in DNA methylation levels were monitored during benign, premalignant and malignant stages of ductal breast cancer development. To study epigenetic events during breast cancer development, four genomic biomarkers (Methylated-IN-Tumour (MINT)17, MINT31, RARMethylation levels increased significantly during the progressive stages of breast cancer development;DNA hypermethylation of selected biomarkers occurs early in breast cancer development, and may present a predictor of malignant potential.
