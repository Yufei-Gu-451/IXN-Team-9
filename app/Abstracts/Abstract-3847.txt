This study investigated the efficacy of a combination gene therapy to repress IL-1 and RANKL for the treatment of particulate debris-induced aseptic loosening, and tried to explore the molecular mechanism the exogenous gene modifications on osteoclastogenesis. RAW cells activated by titanium particles were transduced with DFG-IL-1Ra and AAV-OPG individually or in combination for 4 weeks. Pro-inflammatory cytokines in culture media were determined by ELISA, and gene expressions of RANK, IL-1beta, c-Fos, TRAF6, JNK1, and CPK were examined using real-time PCR. An established knee-implant-failure mouse model was employed to evaluate the efficacy of the
