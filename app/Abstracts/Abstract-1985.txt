Dephosphorylation of MEI-1 activates katanin during meiosis, whereas ubiquitin-mediated degradation of both MEI-1 and its activator PPFR-1 ensure efficient katanin inactivation during mitosis. Katanin is an evolutionarily conserved microtubule (MT)-severing complex implicated in multiple aspects of MT dynamics. In
