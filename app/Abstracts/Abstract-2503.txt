To elucidate how neuronal ensembles interactively encode higher brain processes, new and improved methods for both recording and manipulating neuronal activity will be required. None-NoneDREADDs, first revealed in 2005,Nonewere developed using directed molecular evolution of human muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. NoneSince the introduction of the DREADD technology, a large number of papers have independently validated the utility of excitatory and inhibitory DREADDs. None,None-NoneIn addition, no effect related to the ectopic expression of hM3Dq or hM4Di has been observed. However, a small fraction of CNO is apparently metabolized to clozapine in humans, nonhuman primates and guinea pigs. We describe the design, synthesis, and pharmacological evaluation of new CNO analogues and discuss the interesting SAR trends revealed from the studies. To understand the SAR of CNO analogues as hM3Dq agonists, we explored several regions of the CNO scaffold. In particular, we focused on investigating the R1and R2substituents as well as modifications to the piperazine ring (highlighted in red in Figure1). Reduction of the nitro moiety of compound17yielded compound18, which was refluxed in xylene to generate the benzodiazepine19. EC50values are the average of at least two duplicate experiments with standard deviation (SD) values that are 3-fold less than the average. Because compound13contains an alpha,alpha-dideutero ethyl group, it is likely that theN-dealkylation, the major metabolic pathway that converts clozapine to des-methyl clozapine,None,Nonewill be significantly reduced on the basis of the well-documented primary kinetic isotope effectNonein similar systems. None,NoneCompounds13and21are potent hM3Dq agonists and do not activate hM3 being similar to compound5a(CNO). We were also pleased to find that the 8-chloro group was not required to maintain high agonist potency and efficacy for hM3Dq. In particular, compound21was a potent full agonist (EC50= 1.7 nM,Emax= 100%) of hM3Dq (Figure2). We next selected a subset of the above hM3Dq agonists that are inactive against hM3 and assessed their binding affinities to other aminergic GPCRs. Because compound4a(clozapine) showed high binding affinities to 5HT2Aand 5HT2Cserotonin, alpha1Aadrenergic, and H1histamine receptors withKivalues of 5.4, 9.4, 1.6, and 1.1 nM, respectively (Table2), we tested compounds4b,4c,5b,5c,13, and21in 5HT2A, 5HT2C, alpha1A, and H1radioligand binding assays. On the other hand, theN-oxide5bdisplayed weak binding affinities for 5HT2A, 5HT2C, and alpha1A(Ki greater than 1000 nM) and was about 8-fold selective for hM3Dq over H1, while theN-oxide5cdisplayed poor binding affinities to 5HT2A, 5HT2C, and H1(Ki greater than 5000 nM) but was only about 2-fold selective for hM3Dq over alpha1A. Interestingly, compound13, a deuterated analogue of compound4b, exhibited reduced binding affinities to all four receptors compared with compound4b. In addition, the selectivity of compound21against a number of aminergic GPCRs is significantly improved compared with clozapine. These SAR studies lay the foundation for developing the next generation of DREADD ligands that can selectively activate defined neuronal populations in primates. Compound5c(0.068 g, 65% yield) was prepared similarly as5bfrom compound4c(0.100 g, 0.282 mmol) and mCPBA (0.063 g, 0.365 mmol) in CH2Cl2(5 mL). A solution of compound3(0.200 g, 0.760 mmol) and 2-oxypiperazine (0.152 g, 1.52 mmol) in a 1:1 mixture of 1,4-dioxane and ethanol (15 mL) was stirred overnight at 99 degrees C. After concentration, the residue was diluted with EtOAc (50 mL) and the solution was washed with 20 mL of aqueous NaHCO3. The reaction mixture was heated under reflux conditions for 2 h. The reaction was quenched with 0.1 mL of CD3OD at 0 degrees C. The resulting mixture was treated with 0.5 mL of NH4OH at 0 degrees C and filtered through Celite and the filtrate was concentrated.
