NoneThe development of the optogenetics technology pioneered by Diesseroth and colleagues to visualize and activate neuronal activity with exquisite temporal resolution using engineered channelrhodopsinNone,Noneand other opsinsNonehas provided an expanding toolbox for decoding the neuronal correlates of brain function. In addition to the loss in potency, the compounds with a longer or bulkierN-alkyl group (e.g., compounds4b-4dand5b-5d) in general displayed lower agonist efficacy for hM3Dq and became partial agonists of hM3Dq rather than full agonists as seen for compounds4aand5a. We were also pleased to find that compounds4b-4dand5b-5ddid not display any agonist activity (EC50 greater than 30 000 nM) for the native human M3 receptor (hM3), in contrast to compound4a(clozapine), which was a hM3 agonist with sub-muM potency. In addition, compounds4a-4dwere in general more potent than their correspondingN-oxides5a-5dat activating hM3Dq, suggesting that the negative charge on theN-oxides is not only not required for activating hM3Dq, but also reduces agonist potency. However, compound6was also a potent full agonist of hM3 (EC50= 9.5 nM,Emax= 92) even though it achieves greater than 100-fold higher potency for hM3Dq over hM3. Taken together, these results suggest that either a basic amino group as in compounds4aand4bor a group with permanent positive charge as in compounds5aand6is required to retain hM3Dq agonist activity. On the other hand, compound11, which is the des-methyl clozapine, showed similar potency and efficacy for hM3Dq and hM3 as clozapine, suggesting that theN-methyl group is not required for activating hM3Dq. In particular, compound21was a potent full agonist (EC50= 1.7 nM,Emax= 100%) of hM3Dq (Figure2). We explored multiple regions of the CNO scaffold and observed the following interesting SAR trends: (1) a longer or bulkierN-alkyl group as in compounds4c,4d,5c, and5dreduces both potency and efficacy for hM3Dq; (2) a basic amino group as in compounds4aand4bor a permanent positive charge group as in compounds5aand6is required to retain hM3Dq agonist activity; (3) the negative change on theN-oxides such as5a-5dreduces hM3Dq agonist potency; (4) the 8-chloro group is not required to maintain high agonist potency and efficacy for hM3Dq; and (5) modifications to the benzodiazepine tricyclic core of CNO is tolerated.
