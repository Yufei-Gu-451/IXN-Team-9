None,NoneAfter multiple rounds of random mutagenesis, DREADDs derived from the human muscarinic acetylcholine M3 receptors (hM3Dq) to be insensitive to the endogenous ligand acetylcholine (ACh) but potently and selectively activated by the pharmacologically inert clozapineN-oxide (CNO) were discovered. Importantly, CNO lacks appreciable affinity (Ki greater than 1 muM) for all relevant native CNS (central nervous system) targets. None,None-NoneIn addition, no effect related to the ectopic expression of hM3Dq or hM4Di has been observed. To understand the SAR of CNO analogues as hM3Dq agonists, we explored several regions of the CNO scaffold. We next synthesized the analogues outlined in Scheme2to determine whether the positive charge of CNO is required for activating hM3Dq. Treatment of compound19with POCl3provided the chloride20, which was then displaced with piperazine to afford compound21. None,None,NoneAgonist activities of these compounds in the hM3Dq and hM3 functional assays are summarized in Table1. None,NoneCompounds13and21are potent hM3Dq agonists and do not activate hM3 being similar to compound5a(CNO). We were also pleased to find that the 8-chloro group was not required to maintain high agonist potency and efficacy for hM3Dq. Interestingly, compound13, a deuterated analogue of compound4b, exhibited reduced binding affinities to all four receptors compared with compound4b. We were pleased to find that compound21displayed much improved selectivity compared with compound4a(clozapine). From this screen, we discovered perlapine as a novel, potent agonist of hM3Dq (Figure3). In addition, the selectivity of compound21against a number of aminergic GPCRs is significantly improved compared with clozapine. Different linear gradient for different compounds were used with A being H2O + 0.5% TFA and B being MeOH. HRMS (ESI) calcd for C20H24ClN4+[M + H]+: 355.1689.
