We also report the discovery that perlapine, a hypnotic agent first reported in 1966,None-Noneis a novel, potent, and selective agonist of hM3Dq ( greater than 10 000-fold selective for hM3Dq over hM3). To understand the SAR of CNO analogues as hM3Dq agonists, we explored several regions of the CNO scaffold. We next synthesized the analogues outlined in Scheme2to determine whether the positive charge of CNO is required for activating hM3Dq. None,None,NoneAgonist activities of these compounds in the hM3Dq and hM3 functional assays are summarized in Table1. In addition, compounds4a-4dwere in general more potent than their correspondingN-oxides5a-5dat activating hM3Dq, suggesting that the negative charge on theN-oxides is not only not required for activating hM3Dq, but also reduces agonist potency. On the other hand, compound11, which is the des-methyl clozapine, showed similar potency and efficacy for hM3Dq and hM3 as clozapine, suggesting that theN-methyl group is not required for activating hM3Dq. Interestingly, compound13, which is a deuterated analogue of compound4b, exhibited similar potency and efficacy (EC50= 9.6 nM,Emax= 86%) for hM3Dq as compounds4band5a(CNO) (Figure2). None,NoneCompounds13and21are potent hM3Dq agonists and do not activate hM3 being similar to compound5a(CNO). We were also pleased to find that the 8-chloro group was not required to maintain high agonist potency and efficacy for hM3Dq. In addition, compound22was found to be a potent hM3Dq agonist (EC50= 1.3 nM,Emax= 81%), which was more potent than the corresponding chloro analogue, compound4b(EC50= 7.0 nM,Emax= 91%). Lastly, to identify an alternative compound that might activate hM3Dq, we conducted a screen of the commercially available Library Of Pharmaceutically Active Compounds (LOPAC;N= 1280 compounds) and Prestwick Chemical Library (N= 1280 compounds) using the hM3Dq FLIPR assay. In addition, the selectivity of compound21against a number of aminergic GPCRs is significantly improved compared with clozapine. HPLC purity 100%, RT 4.099 min.
