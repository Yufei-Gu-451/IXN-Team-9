To date, no SAR studies have been reported for any DREADDs including hM3Dq and hM4Di. We extensively explored multiple regions of the scaffold represented by CNO, which resulted in the discovery of compounds13and21that are very potent hM3Dq agonists but do not activate the native human M3 receptor (hM3). To understand the SAR of CNO analogues as hM3Dq agonists, we explored several regions of the CNO scaffold. We next synthesized the analogues outlined in Scheme2to determine whether the positive charge of CNO is required for activating hM3Dq. None,None,NoneAgonist activities of these compounds in the hM3Dq and hM3 functional assays are summarized in Table1. The quaternary ammonium salt6was an extremely potent full agonist of hM3Dq with an EC50value of 69 pM and about 15-fold more potent than compound4a(clozapine). However, compound6was also a potent full agonist of hM3 (EC50= 9.5 nM,Emax= 92) even though it achieves greater than 100-fold higher potency for hM3Dq over hM3. On the other hand, compound11, which is the des-methyl clozapine, showed similar potency and efficacy for hM3Dq and hM3 as clozapine, suggesting that theN-methyl group is not required for activating hM3Dq. Interestingly, compound13, which is a deuterated analogue of compound4b, exhibited similar potency and efficacy (EC50= 9.6 nM,Emax= 86%) for hM3Dq as compounds4band5a(CNO) (Figure2). We were also pleased to find that the 8-chloro group was not required to maintain high agonist potency and efficacy for hM3Dq. In addition, compound22was found to be a potent hM3Dq agonist (EC50= 1.3 nM,Emax= 81%), which was more potent than the corresponding chloro analogue, compound4b(EC50= 7.0 nM,Emax= 91%). From this screen, we discovered perlapine as a novel, potent agonist of hM3Dq (Figure3). Importantly, perlapine was greater than 10 000-fold selective for hM3Dq over hM3.
