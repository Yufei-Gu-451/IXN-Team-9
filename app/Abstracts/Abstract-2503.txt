To elucidate how neuronal ensembles interactively encode higher brain processes, new and improved methods for both recording and manipulating neuronal activity will be required. None,NoneThe ability to selectively modulate the activity of defined neuronal populations and to elucidate the behavioral consequences of this selective neuronal modulation affords powerful approaches for studying mammalian brain function in health and disease. Historically, important methods include Wilder Penfield's pioneering studies of focal electrical stimulation of the human cortex. None,NoneThe DREADDs have no detectable constitutive activity in vitroNoneand, thus, provide an attractive orthologous receptor-effector chemogenetic platform for modifying neuronal activity remotely with minimal invasiveness. NoneSince the introduction of the DREADD technology, a large number of papers have independently validated the utility of excitatory and inhibitory DREADDs. None,None,NoneBecause clozapine modulates the activity of many native CNS receptors,Nonethus interfering with the selective activation of the DREADDs in defined neuronal populations, the "back-metabolism" issue presents a hurdle for translating the DREADD technology forward. Here, we report the first SAR studies of hM3Dq. We extensively explored multiple regions of the scaffold represented by CNO, which resulted in the discovery of compounds13and21that are very potent hM3Dq agonists but do not activate the native human M3 receptor (hM3). We describe the design, synthesis, and pharmacological evaluation of new CNO analogues and discuss the interesting SAR trends revealed from the studies. To understand the SAR of CNO analogues as hM3Dq agonists, we explored several regions of the CNO scaffold. We next synthesized the analogues outlined in Scheme2to determine whether the positive charge of CNO is required for activating hM3Dq. Importantly, compound13did not display any agonist activity for hM3. We were also pleased to find that the 8-chloro group was not required to maintain high agonist potency and efficacy for hM3Dq. Because compound4a(clozapine) showed high binding affinities to 5HT2Aand 5HT2Cserotonin, alpha1Aadrenergic, and H1histamine receptors withKivalues of 5.4, 9.4, 1.6, and 1.1 nM, respectively (Table2), we tested compounds4b,4c,5b,5c,13, and21in 5HT2A, 5HT2C, alpha1A, and H1radioligand binding assays. On the other hand, theN-oxide5bdisplayed weak binding affinities for 5HT2A, 5HT2C, and alpha1A(Ki greater than 1000 nM) and was about 8-fold selective for hM3Dq over H1, while theN-oxide5cdisplayed poor binding affinities to 5HT2A, 5HT2C, and H1(Ki greater than 5000 nM) but was only about 2-fold selective for hM3Dq over alpha1A. Importantly, perlapine was greater than 10 000-fold selective for hM3Dq over hM3. Interestingly, perlapine contains a different tricyclic core in comparison with CNO. The high hM3Dq potency of perlapine suggests that the benzodiazepine tricyclic core of the CNO (compound5a) scaffold is not required for maintaining high hM3Dq agonist activity. In addition, the selectivity of compound21against a number of aminergic GPCRs is significantly improved compared with clozapine. These SAR studies lay the foundation for developing the next generation of DREADD ligands that can selectively activate defined neuronal populations in primates. The resulting solution was washed with 30 mL of aqueous NaHCO3. A solution of compound3(0.200 g, 0.760 mmol) and 2-oxypiperazine (0.152 g, 1.52 mmol) in a 1:1 mixture of 1,4-dioxane and ethanol (15 mL) was stirred overnight at 99 degrees C. After concentration, the residue was diluted with EtOAc (50 mL) and the solution was washed with 20 mL of aqueous NaHCO3. The organic layer was dried over Na2SO4and the filtrate was concentrated.
