Cervical myelopathy is a spinal cord dysfunction related to degeneration typical of aging. Its primary pathology is related to ischemia and spinal cord compression. Patients with myelopathy present many clinical problems; more severe cases may lead to quadriplegia if not treated in a timely manner. Because the primary pathology of this disease is caused by compression, thus generating spinal cord ischemia, we believed there must be a correlation between the degree of compression and the clinical assessment of patients with cervical myelopathy, but we did not find any study in the literature that made this correlation. Because there is doubt the literature we aimed, in our study, to analyze the correlation between the degree of clinical impairment of patients with cervical myelopathy and the Torg index. A prospective, descriptive study, evaluating 46 patients, in which radiographic measurements of the Torg index were performed, with clinical analysis through the Nurick and JOA scale. Of the 46 study patients included in the study, 100% presented a Torg score less than 0.8. The decrease in Torg values was directly proportional to clinical worsening on the Nurick and JOA scale. The degree of clinical impairment in patients with cervical myelopathy is directly related to the degree of spinal canal stenosis.
