To describe the prescription patterns of analgesics during the last 3 months of life in lung cancer and to determine the associated factors. Data on lung cancer patients (The overall prescription prevalences were 50.4% (95% confidence interval (CI): 49.4-51.4%) for level 1 (e.g., paracetamol), 34.1% (95% CI: 33.2-35.0%) for level 2 (weak opioids), and 55.5 % (95% CI: 54.5-56.4%) for level 3 analgesics (strong opioids). Prescription prevalence of analgesics of all levels showed an increasing trend over the period 2000-2008 (annual increases range: 1.1-1.5%) but a decreasing trend with age (average decrease per group range: -5.8 to -1.8%). Patients in the older age groups were less likely to be prescribed level 3 analgesics than those in the younger age groups (PRAnalgesics have been increasingly prescribed in lung cancer. However, analgesics, especially at level 3, were relatively under-prescribed to people older than 70 years, warranting further investigation.
