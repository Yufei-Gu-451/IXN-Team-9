In the liver, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) plays an important role in the suppression of gluconeogenic enzyme expression. While obesity-associated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has been shown to increase hepatic gluconeogenic enzyme expression, the role of ER stress in STAT3-dependent regulation of such expression is unclear. The current study aimed to elucidate the effect of ER stress on the STAT3-dependent regulation of hepatic gluconeogenic enzyme expression. Genetically obese/diabetic
