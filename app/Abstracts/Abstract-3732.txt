Given the transient nature of exercise-induced improvements in insulin sensitivity, it has been speculated that daily exercise is preferred to maximize the benefits of exercise for glycemic control. The current study investigates the impact of daily exercise versus exercise performed every other day on glycemic control in type 2 diabetic patients. Thirty type 2 diabetic patients (age 60 +/- 1 years, BMI 30.4 +/- 0.7 kg/mThe prevalence of hyperglycemia (blood glucose greater than 10 mmol/L) was reduced from 7:40 +/- 1:00 h:min per day (32 +/- 4% of the time) to 5:46 +/- 0:58 and 5:51 +/- 0:47 h:min per day, representing 24 +/- 4 and 24 +/- 3% of the time, when exercise was performed either daily or every other day, respectively (A short 30-min session of moderate-intensity endurance-type exercise substantially reduces the prevalence of hyperglycemia throughout the subsequent day in type 2 diabetic patients. When total work is being matched, daily exercise does not further improve daily glycemia compared with exercise performed every other day.
