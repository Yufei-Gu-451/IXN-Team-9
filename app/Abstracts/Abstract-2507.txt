reported an educational mechanism for human NK cells that involves self-specific inhibitory KIR and cognate HLA ligand interactions. demonstrated that NK cells, which express multiple inhibitory KIRs for self-HLA ligands within variegated NK cell repertoires, show a synergistic effect of licensing, i.e., the expression of progressively higher numbers of self-reactive inhibitory KIRs is correlated with increased effector capacity. also showed a linear effect of KIR gene copy number variation and HLA ligands on the overall functional responsiveness of the NK cell repertoire by analyzing KIR-HLA genotypes of healthy human volunteers. Based on this fact and the evidence of a quantitative effect of NK cell licensing, we wondered whether the multiplicity of functional KIR-HLA compound genotypes might exclusively influence intrahepatic carcinogenesis or metastasis, regardless of their origin. We demonstrated the predictive value of the multiplicity of functional KIR-HLA compound genotypes for HCC recurrence after curative hepatectomy. To this end, the clinical efficacy of adoptive immunotherapy with interleukin-2 and anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody-activated autologous peripheral lymphocytes, such as NK cells, has been evaluated; prolonged relapse-free survival in HCC patients following resection of the primary tumor was analyzed. As liver NK cells display more vigorous cytotoxicity against HCC than peripheral NK cells, we recently proposed a novel type of adjuvant immunotherapy for preventing HCC recurrence in liver transplant recipients.
