NK cells are key components of the innate immune system that act against infectious and neoplastic cells. NoneThe polymorphic genes for KIRs and their cognate HLA ligands generate diverse immune responses. This year, we were the first to report the impact of multiplicity of functional KIR-HLA compound genotypes on HCC recurrence after curative hepatectomy. NoneNoneNoneNK cell licensing depends on the number of functional KIR-HLA compound genotypes. In this immunotherapy, transplant recipients are intravenously injected with lymphokine-activated killer cells, including activated NK cells derived from liver allografts. NoneTo define the long-term benefits of this approach in terms of the control of HCC recurrence after liver transplantation, a phase II trial, which will investigate the influence of the KIR-HLA genotypes in donors and recipients of liver transplants, is currently under consideration.
