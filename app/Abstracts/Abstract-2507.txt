NoneThe polymorphic genes for KIRs and their cognate HLA ligands generate diverse immune responses. NoneRecently, Beziatz et al. also showed a linear effect of KIR gene copy number variation and HLA ligands on the overall functional responsiveness of the NK cell repertoire by analyzing KIR-HLA genotypes of healthy human volunteers. NoneDespite the accumulating evidence suggesting a quantitative effect of NK cell licensing in basic studies, its clinical impact on neoplastic diseases has never been demonstrated. This result matches the previously postulated theory that the number and type of host MHC class I alleles quantitatively tune the responsiveness of individual NK cell subsets expressing the corresponding KIR. NoneHence, the impact of NK cell licensing on the therapeutic outcome of antibody targeting agents may need to be elucidated through further studies.
