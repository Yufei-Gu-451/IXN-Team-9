NK cells are key components of the innate immune system that act against infectious and neoplastic cells. NK cell activation is dependent upon the inhibitory-activating receptor equilibrium. NoneDespite the accumulating evidence suggesting a quantitative effect of NK cell licensing in basic studies, its clinical impact on neoplastic diseases has never been demonstrated. The quantitative effects of NK cell licensing influence the overall functionality of NK cell-mediated tumor surveillance. The difference in NK cell repertoires potentially generates different NK cell surveillance functions, e.g., abundant recruitment of highly licensed NK cells prevents carcinogenesis through attacks on circulating metastatic cells in sinusoid orde novoneoplastic cells. As liver NK cells display more vigorous cytotoxicity against HCC than peripheral NK cells, we recently proposed a novel type of adjuvant immunotherapy for preventing HCC recurrence in liver transplant recipients. A previous report demonstrated that unlicensed NK cells formed the predominant subset of NK cells, which have potent ADCC due to their lack of inhibitory receptors for self.
