Although electrotherapy appears to have particularly interesting applications in the field of postoperative orthopedic rehabilitation, relatively little scientifically based research has been conducted in the area of electrotherapy with regard to safety involving patients with orthopedic implants. Three electrotherapy forms were tested, such as high-volt stimulation (HVS), transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS), and galvanic current (GAL), using a model system containing a metal implant plate to evaluate whether heating in excess of 3 degrees C would occur. All changes in temperature for HVS, GAL, and TENS therapeutic electrical currents observed in our model system fall below the predefined 3 degrees C.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first experimental based observation that prolonged exposure to a direct electrical current at therapeutic strength does not result in heating of metal titanium plates.
