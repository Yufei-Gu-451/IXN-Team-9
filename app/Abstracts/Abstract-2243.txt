Coeliac disease is an autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation localized to the small bowel, but less is known about systemic signs of inflammation. The aim was to measure cytokines of the T helper 1 (Th1) and T helper 2 (Th2) cell patterns in children with screening-detected coeliac disease before and after treatment with a gluten-free diet. Serum samples selected before and after the start of a gluten-free diet from 26 3-year-old children diagnosed with biopsy-proven coeliac disease and from 52 matched controls were assayed in an multiplex enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the 10 cytokines: interferon (IFN)-gamma, interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. Among Th1 cytokines, IFN-gamma and IL-12p70 were elevated significantly in children with coeliac disease compared to controls (
