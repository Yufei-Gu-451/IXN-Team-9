To determine the usefulness of measuring hemoglobin AWe evaluated the status of carbohydrate metabolism by performing the OGTT and fasting glucose and A1C tests in 231 postpartum women with prior GDM 1 year after delivery. The prevalence of abnormal carbohydrate metabolism was 45.89% by the OGTT criterion, 19.05% by the A1C test criterion, 38.10% by the fasting glucose test criterion, and 46.75% by the A1C-fasting glucose test criteria. Using the OGTT as the gold standard, abnormal carbohydrate metabolism according to the A1C test criterion had 22.64% sensitivity and 54.55% positive predictive value; abnormal carbohydrate metabolism by the fasting glucose criterion had 83.02% sensitivity and 100% positive predictive value. The A1C-fasting glucose test criteria classified 18 women with normal carbohydrate metabolism as having abnormal carbohydrate metabolism. Abnormal carbohydrate metabolism by the A1C-fasting glucose test criteria had 83.02% sensitivity and 81.48% positive predictive value. Our results seem to indicate that the A1C test criterion alone or in combination with fasting glucose test criterion does not provide a sensitive and specific diagnosis of abnormal carbohydrate metabolism in women who have had GDM.
