Pancreatic cancer (PC) remains a highly lethal malignancy due to its unusual chemoresistance and high aggressiveness. A subpopulation of pancreatic tumor cells, known as cancer stem cells (CSCs), is considered responsible not only for tumor-maintenance, but also for its widespread metastasis and therapeutic failure. Here we investigated the role of p-21 activated kinase 4 (PAK4) in driving PC stemness properties. Our data demonstrate that triple-positive (CD24
