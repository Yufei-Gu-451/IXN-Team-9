Glioma stem-like cell (GSC) properties are responsible for gliomagenesis and recurrence. GSCs are invasive but its mechanism remains to be elucidated. Here, we attempted to identify the molecules that promote invasion in GSCs. Neurospheres and CD133Neurospheres from surgical specimens attached to fibronectin and laminin, the receptors of which belong to the integrin family. IntegrinOur results suggest that integrin
