The usefulness of positron emission tomography with computed tomography (PET-CT) in the surveillance of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in complete metabolic remission after primary therapy is not well studied. We performed a retrospective review of our database between 2002 and 2009 for patients withFour-hundred and fifty scans were performed in 116 patients, with a median follow-up of 53 (range 8-133) months from completion of therapy. Thirteen patients (11%) relapsed: seven were suspected clinically and six were subclinical (all within first 18 months). The positive predictive value in patients with international prognostic index (IPI) less than 3 was 56% compared with 80% in patients with IPI?3. Including indeterminate scans, PET-CT retained high sensitivity 95% and specificity 97% for relapse. Positron emission tomography with computed tomography is not useful in patients for the majority of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in CMR after primary therapy, with the possible exception of patients with baseline IPI ?3 in the 18 months following completion of primary therapy. This issue could be addressed by a prospective clinical trial.
