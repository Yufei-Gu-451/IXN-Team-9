Despite mounting pre-clinical and clinical evidence of the beneficial effects of cell-based therapy, optimal cell dosing and delivery approaches have not been identified. Cardiospheres are self-assembling three-dimensional (3D) microtissues formed by cardiac stem cells and supporting cell types. The ability of cardiospheres to augment cardiac function has been demonstrated in animal models of ischemic cardiomyopathy. In this study, we studied the dose dependence of the benefits of human cardiospheres, delivered
