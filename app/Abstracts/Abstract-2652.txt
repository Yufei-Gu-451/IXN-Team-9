The objective of this study was to assess whether resident exposure to liver transplantation anesthesia results in improved patient care during a simulated critical care scenario. Our hypothesis was that anesthesia residents exposed to liver transplantation anesthesia care would be able to identify and treat a simulated hyperkalemic crisis after reperfusion more appropriately than residents who have not been involved in liver transplantation anesthesia care. Participation in liver transplantation anesthesia is not a mandatory component of the curriculum of anesthesiology training programs in the United States. It is unclear whether exposure to liver transplantation anesthesia is beneficial for skill set development. A high-fidelity human patient simulation scenario was developed. Times for administration of epinephrine, calcium chloride, and secondary hyperkalemia treatment were recorded. A total of 25 residents with similar training levels participated: 13 residents had previous liver transplantation experience (OLT), whereas 12 residents had not been previously exposed to liver transplantations (non-OLT). The OLT group performed better in recognizing and treating the hyperkalemic crisis than the non-OLT group. Pharmacologic therapy for hyperkalemia was given earlier (OLT 53.3 +/- 27.0 seconds versus non-OLT 148 +/- 104.1 seconds;
