Stem cells and progenitors in many lineages undergo self- renewing divisions, but the extracellular and intracellular proteins that regulate this process are largely unknown. Glucocorticoids stimulate red cell formation by promoting self-renewal of early erythroid burst forming unit-erythrocyte (BFU-E) progenitors
