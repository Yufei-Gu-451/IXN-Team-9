Apolipoprotein (apo) O is a novel apolipoprotein that is present predominantly in high density lipoprotein (HDL). However, overexpression of apoO does not impact on plasma HDL levels or functionality in human apoA-I transgenic mice. Thus, the physiological function of apoO is not yet known. In the present study, we investigated relationships between plasma apoO levels and high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels, as well as other lipid parameters in healthy subjects (n = 111) and patients with established acute coronary syndrome (ACS) (n = 50). ApoO was measured by the sandwich dot-blot technique with recombinant apoO as a protein standard. Mean apoO level in healthy subjects was 2.21 +/- 0.83 ug/ml whereas it was 4.94 +/- 1.59 ug/ml in ACS patients. There were significant differences in plasma level of apoO between two groups (
