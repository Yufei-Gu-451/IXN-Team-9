Pluripotent cells can be derived from various types of somatic cells by nuclear reprogramming using defined transcription factors. It is however unclear whether human cancer cells can be similarly reprogrammed and subsequently terminally differentiated with abrogation of tumorigenicity. Here, using sarcomas we show that human derived complex karyotype solid tumors: (1) can be reprogrammed into a pluripotent-like state as defined by all in vitro criteria used to define pluripotent stem cells generated from somatic cells; (2) can be terminally differentiated into mature connective tissue and red blood cells; and (3) terminal differentiation is accompanied with loss of both proliferation and tumorigenicity. We go on to perform the
