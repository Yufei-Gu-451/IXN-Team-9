Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a spectrum of genetic disorders characterized by bone fragility. It is caused by dominant mutations affecting the synthesis and/or structure of type I procollagen or by recessively inherited mutations in genes responsible for the posttranslational processing/trafficking of type I procollagen. Recessive OI type VI is unique among OI types in that it is characterized by an increased amount of unmineralized osteoid, thereby suggesting a distinct disease mechanism. In a large consanguineous family with OI type VI, we performed homozygosity mapping and next-generation sequencing of the candidate gene region to isolate and identify the causative gene. We describe loss of function mutations in serpin peptidase inhibitor, clade F, member 1 (
