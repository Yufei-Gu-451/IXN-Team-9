Lenalidomide is an active immunomodulatory and antiproliferative agent in multiple myeloma. However, the molecular mechanisms driving these activities are not yet fully elucidated. Therefore, we investigated the modulation of the cytokine/growth factor patterns of myeloma cells under LEN treatment. Lenalidomide effect on myeloma cell proliferation was investigated in a myeloma cell line collection (Lenalidomide inhibits the proliferation of two-thirds of myeloma cell lines independently of their genetic background. We demonstrated that LEN increased TNF-Lenalidomide favours a uniform TNF-
