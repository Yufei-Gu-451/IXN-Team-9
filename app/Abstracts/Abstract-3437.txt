The probability of a mammographic Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) 3 lesion being cancer is considered to be less than 2%. Therefore, the work-up of a mammographic BI-RADS 3 lesion should be biopsy or follow-up mammography after 6 months. However, most patients referred for biopsy have benign disease. Although the negative predictive value (NPV) of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is highest of all imaging techniques, it is not yet common practice to use breast MRI as a problem-solving modality to exclude patients for further diagnostic work-up. Therefore, in this meta-analysis the usefulness of breast MRI as a problem-solving modality in mammographic BI-RADS 3 lesions is investigated. After a systematic search only 5 out of 61 studies met the inclusion criteria. The NPV in 2 of those studies was reported to be 100%. It was concluded that MRI can be used as an adjunctive tool to mammographic BI-RADS 3 findings to exclude patients for further diagnostic work-up. The other 3 studies assessed the accuracy of MRI in mammographic BI-RADS 3 microcalcifications. These studies reported an NPV of MRI between 76% and 97%. Therefore, MRI cannot be implemented as a diagnostic tool to evaluate mammographic microcalcifications at this time. The first solid data indicate that breast MRI might be useful as a problem-solving modality to exclude patients with non-calcified mammographic BI-RADS 3 lesions for further diagnostic work-up. However, further research is needed to verify these results.
