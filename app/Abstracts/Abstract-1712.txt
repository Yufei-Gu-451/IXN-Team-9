Several mechanisms, such as innate immune responses via Toll-like receptor-4, accumulation of diacylglycerols (DAG)/ceramides, and activation of protein kinase C (PKC), are considered to underlie skeletal muscle insulin resistance. In this study, we examined initial events occurring during the onset of insulin resistance upon oral high-fat loading compared with lipid and low-dose endotoxin infusion. Sixteen lean insulin-sensitive volunteers received intravenous fat (iv fat), oral fat (po fat), intravenous endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide [LPS]), and intravenous glycerol as control. After 6 h, whole-body insulin sensitivity was reduced by iv fat, po fat, and LPS to 60, 67, and 48%, respectively (all
