Inadvertent mammalian tissue exposures to low doses of ionizing radiation (IR) after radiation accidents, remediation of radioactive-contaminated areas, space travel, or a dirty bomb represents an interesting trauma to an organism. Possible low dose IR-induced bystander effects could impact our evaluation of human health effects, since cells within tissue are not equally damaged after doses of IR less than =10 cGy. To understand tissue responses after low IR doses, we generated a reporter system using the human clusterin promoter fused to firefly luciferase (hCLUp-Luc). Secretory clusterin (sCLU), an extra-cellular molecular chaperone, induced by low doses of cytotoxic agents, clears cell debris. Low dose IR ( greater than =2 cGy) exposure induced hCLUp-Luc activity with peak levels at 96 h, consistent with endogenous sCLU levels. As doses increased ( greater than =1 Gy), sCLU induction amplitudes increased and time to peak response decreased. sCLU expression was stimulated by IGF-1, but suppressed by p53. Responses in transgenic hCLUp-Luc reporter mice after low IR doses showed that specific tissues (i.e., colon, spleen, mammary, thymus, bone marrow) of female mice induced hCLUp-Luc activity more than male mice after whole body ( greater than =10 cGy) irradiation. Tissue-specific, non-linear dose- and time-responses of hCLUp-Luc and endogenous sCLU levels were noted. Colon maintained homeostatic balance after 10 cGy. Bone marrow responded with delayed, but prolonged and elevated expression. Intraperitoneal administration of alpha-TGFbeta1 (1D11), but not control (13C4) antibodies, immediately following IR exposure abrogated CLU induction responses. Induction
