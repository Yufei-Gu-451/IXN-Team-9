Aberrant activation of Notch signaling plays an essential role in colorectal cancer (CRC) progression. Amplified in breast cancer 1 (AIB1), also known as SRC-3 or NCOA3 is a transcriptional coactivator that promotes cancer cell proliferation and invasiveness. However AIB1 implication in CRC progression through enhancing Notch signaling is unknown. In this study we found that several CRC cell lines expressed high levels of AIB1, and knockdown of AIB1 decreased cell proliferation, colony formation and tumorigenesis of these CRC cells. Specifically, knockdown of AIB1 inhibited cell cycle progression at G1 phase by decreasing the mRNA levels of Cyclin A2, Cyclin B1, Cyclin E2 and Hes1. Furthermore, AIB1 interacted with Notch intracellular domain (NICD) and Mastermind-like 1 (MAMAL1) and was recruited to the Hes1 promoter to enhance Notch signaling. Downregulation of AIB1 also decreased CRC cell invasiveness
