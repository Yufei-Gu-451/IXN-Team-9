Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) is increasingly being used to assess tumour response to a variety of anticancer treatments. The technique is quick to perform without the need for administration of exogenous contrast medium, and enables the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of tissues to be quantified. Studies have shown that ADC increases in response to a variety of treatments including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, minimally invasive therapies and novel therapeutics. In this article, we review the rationale of applying DWI for tumour assessment, the evidence for ADC measurements in relation to specific treatments and some of the practical considerations for using ADC to evaluate treatment response.
