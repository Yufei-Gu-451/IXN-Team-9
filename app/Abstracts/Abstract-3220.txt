Antibodies against citrullinated proteins (ACPAs) are highly specific for RA. Since the discovery of these antibodies, several of studies that focused on the presence and identity of citrullinated proteins in the joints of RA patients have been carried out. The best-known antigens that bind ACPAs are citrullinated filaggrin, Type II collagen (CII), alpha-enolase, fibrinogen and vimentin. This review compares citrullinated filaggrin, CII, alpha-enolase and fibrinogen with vimentin in their contribution to ACPA triggering, and gives an overview of the literature in which the role of citrullinated and non-citrullinated vimentin in the onset of ACPA production and the pathogenesis of RA is discussed.
