Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour (IMFT) is a relatively uncommon neoplasm with unpredictable malignant potential known to occur anywhere in the body. IMFT involving the omentum is a very rare entity with less than 15 cases reported so far. We report a case of omental IMFT in a 15-year-old girl who presented with multiple peritoneal masses on imaging and the diagnosis was confirmed on histopathology. In addition to its uncommon location, its presentation as multiple masses is extremely uncommon. This uncommon presentation as multifocal masses needs to be distinguished from other causes of peritoneal carcinomatosis.
