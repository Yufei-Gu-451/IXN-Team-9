Cotton is a major world crop that is notoriously susceptible to waterlogging damage, particularly when cultivated on fine-textured soils. However, damage is also exacerbated because of inadequate acclimation of roots to low oxygen levels, and secondary effects on shoots. Despite the commercial importance of cotton, very little has been published when compared with waterlogged cereals. This review provides a comprehensive view of the constraints on cotton in low-oxygen conditions, including absence of aerenchyma and the inadequacy of fermentation to overcome waterlogging damage. We emphasise the possibilities of improved tolerance through management practices, manipulation of hormone pathways and gene technologies to modify perception and response to low-oxygen environments. Climatic variability, typified by erratic heavy-rainfall events, causes waterlogging in intensively irrigated crops and is exacerbated under warm temperature regimes on soils with poor internal drainage. Irrigated cotton is often grown in precisely these conditions, exposing it to waterlogging-induced yield losses after substantial summer rainfall. This calls for a deeper understanding of mechanisms of waterlogging tolerance and its relevance to cotton. Hence this review suggests possible causes of waterlogging-induced yield loss in cotton and approaches to improvement of waterlogging tolerance, drawing upon the slight body of published data in cotton and principles from other species. The yield penalty depends on soil type, phenological stage and cumulative period of root exposure to air-filled porosities below 10 %. Events in the soil include O
