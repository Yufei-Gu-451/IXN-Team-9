Growing evidence suggests that microscale pedestrian environment features, such as sidewalk quality, crosswalks, and neighborhood esthetics, may affect residents' physical activity. This study examined whether disparities in microscale pedestrian features existed between neighborhoods of differing socioeconomic and racial/ethnic composition. Using the validated Microscale Audit of Pedestrian Streetscapes (MAPS), pedestrian environment features were assessed by trained observers along 1/4-mile routes (Income and race-based differences in streetscapes may aggravate health disparities. Low-income/high-minority neighborhoods had more negative esthetics/social elements. High-income White neighborhoods had poorer sidewalks, crosswalks, and intersections. Disparities occurred most often in residential, not mixed-use neighborhoods. Local streetscape audits are needed to identify and remediate disparities.
