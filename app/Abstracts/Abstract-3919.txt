To describe the prevalence and determinants of hyperfiltration (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] greater than =120 mL/min/1.73 mWe longitudinally studied 600 hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients with albuminuria less than 200 mug/min and who were retrieved from two randomized trials testing the renal effect of trandolapril and delapril. Target blood pressure (BP) was less than 120/80 mmHg, and HbAOver a median (range) follow-up of 4.0 (1.7-8.1) years, GFR declined by 3.37 (5.71-1.31) mL/min/1.73 mDespite intensified treatment, patients with type 2 diabetes have a fast GFR decline. Hyperfiltration affects a subgroup of patients and may contribute to renal function loss and nephropathy onset or progression. Whether amelioration of hyperfiltration is renoprotective is worth investigating.
