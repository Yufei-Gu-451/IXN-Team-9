SSX2IP promotes centrosome maturation and maintenance at the onset of vertebrate development, preserving centrosome integrity and mitosis during rapid cleavage divisions and in somatic cells. Meiotic maturation in vertebrate oocytes is an excellent model system for microtubule reorganization during M-phase spindle assembly. Here, we surveyed changes in the pattern of microtubule-interacting proteins upon
