We report an extremely rare case of malignant hemangiopericytoma (HPC) of the parotid gland and its metastatic spread to lung, liver, and skeletal muscle. Computed tomography (CT) imaging, histopathological and immunohistochemical methods were employed to study the features of malignant HPC and its metastases. CT imaging was helpful to determine the exact location, involvement of adjacent structures and vascularity, as well as evaluating pulmonary, hepatic, peritoneal, and muscular metastases. Immunohistochemical and histopatholgical features of the primary tumor as well as the metastases were consistent with the diagnosis of malignant HPC.
