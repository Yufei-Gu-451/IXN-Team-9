Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is a fatal syndrome caused by mutations in at least 13 different genes. It is characterized by the absence of T-cells. Immune reconstitution can be achieved through non-ablative related donor bone marrow transplantation. However, the first transplant may not provide sufficient immunity. In these cases, booster transplants may be helpful. A prospective/retrospective study was conducted of 49 SCID patients (28.7 percent of 171 SCIDs transplanted over 30 years) who had received booster transplants to define the long term outcome, factors contributing to a need for a booster and factors that predicted success. Of the 49 patients, 31 (63 percent) are alive for up to 28 years. Age at initial transplantation was found to have a significant effect on outcome (mean of 194 days old for patients currently alive, versus a mean of 273 days old for those now deceased, p=0.0401). Persistent viral infection was present in most deceased booster patients. In several patients, the use of two parents as sequential donors resulted in striking T and B cell immune reconstitution. A majority of the patients alive today have normal or adequate T-cell function and are healthy. Non-ablative booster bone marrow transplantation can be life-saving for SCID.
