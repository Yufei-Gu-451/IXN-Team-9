Oxidized LDL (ox-LDL) activates dendritic cells (DCs), thereby initiating inflammation responses in atherosclerosis, yet the modulatory mechanisms remain unclear. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators for DC functions. This study evaluated the regulation by miRNAs of the ox-LDL-induced DC immune response. In CD11c
