The growing use of cross-sectional imaging has led to increasing detection of incidental lesions that previously remained undiscovered. These incidental lesions are unexpected, usually asymptomatic and are not related to the patient's presenting complaint or past medical history. Incidental findings in the kidneys are common and most of them are renal masses. On detection of such renal lesions, the question arises as to the diagnosis and subsequent management of these abnormalities.
