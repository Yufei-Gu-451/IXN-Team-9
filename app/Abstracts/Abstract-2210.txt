This study was conducted in order to investigate the therapeutic effect of closed reduction according to a classification in patients with nasal bone fracture. The study was conducted retrospectively on 186 patients with a mean age of 38 years (range: 7 to 80 years). All patients were diagnosed by clinical and radiologic examination, and then classified according to Hwang's classification by computed tomography. The patients were further classified by their age, gender, causes of fracture, operation timing after fracture, concurrent facial bone fracture, and complications. All patients underwent the same reduction and treatment protocol and were then followed up regularly for at least three months. The cause of the fracture was slip down, and the highest prevalence was shown in the 20s. The mean operation timing after fracture was 4.1 days (range: 1 to 14 days), and it tended to be longer in the case of defected septal bone or more severe fracture. The most common concurrent facial bone fracture was orbital blow-out fracture, and zygomaticomaxillary complex and maxillary fracture occured frequently. The largest number of complications occurred in class III and IIBs patients, and the main complication was postoperative pain. Results of nasal bone closed reduction on the 186 patients showed that serious complications rarely occurred. Closed reduction is generally an effective treatment for nasal bone fracture. However, in the case of severe concurrent septal bone fracture or comminuted fracture with depression, open reduction should be considered. Further study with a larger number of patients and further classification is required.
