Human papillomavirus (HPV), p16 expression, andHuman papillomavirus DNA was determined using an INNO-LiPA-based assay in tumour tissue of 107 patients with locally advanced SCCAC. Patients were treated with radiotherapy, with or without concurrent chemotherapy consisting of a fluoropyrimidine and mitomycin C. Expression of p16 and p53 was determined using immunohistochemistry. Exons 2-11 ofDNA of high-risk HPV types was detected in 93 out of 107 tumours (87%), all of which overexpressed p16 (HPV+/p16+). Of 14 HPV-negative (HPV-) tumours (13%), 10 (9%) were p16-negative (HPV-/p16-) and 4 (4%) overexpressed p16 (HPV-/p16+). Patients with HPV-/p16- disease had inferior 3-year locoregional control (LRC) (15%) compared with patients with HPV+/p16+ tumours (82%,HPV- tumours are frequently
