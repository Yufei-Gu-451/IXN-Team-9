Diverse proteases cleave protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR2) on primary sensory neurons and epithelial cells to evoke pain and inflammation. Trypsin and tryptase activate PAR2 by a canonical mechanism that entails cleavage within the extracellularWe investigated whether the PAR2 antagonist GB88 inhibits protease-evoked activation of nociceptors and protease-stimulated oedema and hyperalgesia in rodents. Intraplantar injection of trypsin, cathespsin-S or elastase stimulated mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia and oedema in mice. Oral GB88 orGB88 inhibits the capacity of canonical and biased protease agonists of PAR2 to cause nociception and inflammation.
