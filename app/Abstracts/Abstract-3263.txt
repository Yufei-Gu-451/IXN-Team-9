Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescentWe compared IHC and Q-RT-PCR in 466 breast tumours. In discordant or equivocal cases, five additional methods (IHC with two other antibodies, FISH, silverWe observed 97.3% concordance between Q-RT-PCR and non-equivocal IHC. Twelve out of 466 cases (3%) revealed discordances between the two methods. The power of Q-RT-PCR to predict HER2 status (defined by seven methods) was similar to that of IHC. Although rare, some discordances between techniques might be due to HER2 intra-tumour heterogeneity and we report two examples, one tumour containing two distinct clones, another tumour consisting of HER2 amplified and non-amplified subclones. Q-RT-PCR and IHC are highly concordant methods for HER2 status assessment, and Q-RT-PCR allows a highly reliable quantitative assessment and could be a useful adjunct to IHC.
