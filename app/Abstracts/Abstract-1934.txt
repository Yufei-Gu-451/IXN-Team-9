Loss of GGPPS from childhood mumps infection or deletion in mice results in constitutively activated MAPK and NF-kB signaling that induces spermatogonium apoptosis, macrophage invasion into seminiferous tubules, and sterility. Mumps commonly affects children 5-9 yr of age, and can lead to permanent adult sterility in certain cases. However, the etiology of this long-term effect remains unclear. Mumps infection results in progressive degeneration of the seminiferous epithelium and, occasionally, Sertoli cell-only syndrome. Thus, the remaining Sertoli cells may be critical to spermatogenesis recovery after orchitis healing. Here, we report that the protein farnesylation/geranylgeranylation balance is critical for patients' fertility. The expression of
