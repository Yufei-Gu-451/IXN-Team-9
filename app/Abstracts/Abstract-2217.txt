This study evaluated woven silk textile for burn wound dressing materials in an animal model. Ten rats were used in this experiment. Full-thickness 2*2 cm burn wounds were created on the back of the rats under anesthesia. In the experimental group, the wounds were treated with three different dressing materials from woven silk textile. In the control group, natural healing without any dressing material was set as control. The wound surface area was measured at five days, seven days, and 14 days. Wound healing was evaluated by histologic analysis. There were no statistically significant differences among groups at five days post injury. The mean defect size at seven days was largest in Group 3 (462.87 mmThe healing of burn wounds was faster with silk weave textile more than the control group. There was no atypical inflammation with silk dressing materials. In conclusion, silk dressing materials could be used to treat burn wounds.
