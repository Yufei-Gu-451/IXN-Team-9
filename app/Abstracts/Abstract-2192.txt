This study compares the bone formation ability of tricalcium phosphate (TCP) with and without recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) and assesses TCP as a carrier of rhBMP-2. Bilateral round defects (diameter: 8.0 mm) were formed in the cranium of eight New Zealand white rabbits. The defects were grafted with TCP only (control group) or with rhBMP-2-coated TCP (experimental group). The animals were sacrificed at 1st week, 2nd week, 4th week, and 8th week postoperatively; two rabbits sacrificed each time. The skulls were harvested and subjected to radiographic and histological examination. Radiologic evaluation showed faster bone remodeling in the experimental group than in the control group. Histologic evaluation (H E, Masson's trichrome stain) showed rapid bone formation, remodeling and calcification in the 1st and 2nd week in the experimental group. Immunohistochemical evaluation showed higher expression rate of osteoprotegerin, receptor activator of nuclear factorrhBMP-2 coated TCP resulted in rapid bone formation, remodeling, and calcification due to rhBMP-2's osteogenic effect. TCP performed properly as a carrier for rhBMP-2. Thus, the use of an rhBMP-2 coating on TCP had a synergic effect on bone healing and, especially, bone remodeling and maturation.
