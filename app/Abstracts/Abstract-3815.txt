The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) Blood Pressure Trial reported no differences in most cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes between intensive and standard blood pressure therapy in individuals with diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension. Many such individuals are centrally obese. Here we evaluate whether the trial outcomes varied by the level of central obesity. The cohort included 4,687 people (47.7% women) with DM and hypertension. Mean age was 62.2, and mean follow-up was 4.7 years. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two blood pressure treatment strategies: intensive (systolic less than 120 mmHg) or standard (systolic less than 140 mmHg). Sex-specific quartiles of waist-to-height ratio were used as the measure of central obesity. The primary ACCORD outcome (a composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction [MI], nonfatal stroke, or CVD death) and three secondary outcomes (nonfatal MI, fatal or nonfatal stroke, and CVD death) were examined using proportional hazard models. There was no evidence that the effect of intensively lowering blood pressure differed by quartile of waist-to-height ratio for any of the four outcomes (Intensive lowering of blood pressure versus standard treatment does not ameliorate CVD risk in individuals with DM and hypertension. These results did not vary by quartile of waist-to-height ratio.
