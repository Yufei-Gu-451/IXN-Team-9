Glypican-5 (GPC5) belongs to the glypican family of proteoglycans that have been implicated in a variety of physiological processes, ranging from cell proliferation to morphogenesis. However, the role of GPC5 in human cancer remains poorly understood. We report that knockdown of GPC5 in bronchial epithelial cells promoted, and forced expression of GPC5 in non-small lung cancer (NSCLC) cells suppressed, the anchorage-independent cell growth. GPC5 suppresses anchorage-independent growth of lung cancer cells. GPC5 suppresses xenograft growth of lung cancer cells. GPC5 is localized to the membrane and suppresses oncogenic RTKs.
