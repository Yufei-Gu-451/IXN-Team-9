To investigate the influence of adiposity on patterns of sex hormones across the menstrual cycle among regularly menstruating women. The BioCycle Study followed 239 healthy women for 1-2 menstrual cycles, with up to 8 visits per cycle timed using fertility monitors. Serum estradiol (E2), progesterone, luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) were measured at each visit. Adiposity was measured by anthropometry and by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. Differences in hormonal patterns by adiposity measures were estimated using nonlinear mixed models, which allow for comparisons in overall mean levels, amplitude (i.e. lowest to highest level within each cycle), and shifts in timing of peaks while adjusting for age, race, energy intake, and physical activity. Compared to normal weight women (n=154), obese women (BMI greater than =30 kg/mGreater total and central adiposity were associated with changes in mean hormone levels. The greater amplitudes observed among obese women suggest compensatory mechanisms at work to maintain hormonal homeostasis. Central adiposity may be more important in influencing timing of hormonal peaks than total adiposity.
