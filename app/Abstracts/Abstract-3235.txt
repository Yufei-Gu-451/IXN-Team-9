Calcified renal metastases from osteosarcoma are extremely rare. We present a case of a young female with osteosarcoma of the right ulna who developed late recurrence in the form of large metastatic calcified renal and pulmonary lesions. Review of the literature suggests that osteosarcoma metastases of the kidneys usually exhibit aggressive behaviour with poor prognosis. A brief review of the calcified renal metastases including the index case is presented.
