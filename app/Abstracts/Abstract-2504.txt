Intestinal immune homeostasis is maintained through a constant molecular dialogue between commensal microbiota, intestinal tissue cells and the mucosal immune systemNone. Breakdown of this mutualistic relationship results in chronic pathologies of the gastrointestinal tract, including inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD)None. Th17 cells, dependent on the transcription factor retinoic acid-related orphan receptor-gammat (Rorgammat), represent a distinct interleukin (IL)-17A-producing CD4+T cell subset that contribute both to host defense from pathogens and to tissue pathologies in a number of inflammatory diseases and experimental models, including colitisNone. Conversely, Foxp3+regulatory T (Treg) cells prevent systemic and tissue-specific autoimmunity, and are crucial for intestinal immune homeostasisNone. In addition to induction under inflammatory conditions, Th17 cells are present within the gastrointestinal tract under homeostatic conditions. Therefore, the role of IL-18 in intestinal immune regulation, as well as the key cellular sources of this cytokine in the gut, remain unclearNone. Here, we demonstrate that intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) regulate colonic CD4+T cell homeostasis through production of IL-18. Under homeostatic conditions, IL-18R1-signaling limited colonic Th17 cell differentiation whereas during inflammation, Foxp3+Treg cell expression of IL-18R1 was critical for prevention of experimental colitis. In addition, expression of genes encoding the antimicrobial peptides S100A8 and S100A9 induced by IL-17A, but not IL-22-induced Reg3gamma, were significantly elevated in colonic tissue ofIl18r1-/-mice when compared to WT controls (Figure 2e). Furthermore, transcriptional analyses demonstrated thatIl18gene expression by intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) was elevated in the presence of commensal microbesNone. Thus, we hypothesized that IEC might represent the major source of IL-18 within the homeostatic intestine. In contrast, IL-18R1-signaling played a global role in promoting Th1 cell differentiation following lymphopenic expansion in this competitive chimeric environment, as significantly lower frequencies of Th1 cells were derived fromIl18r1-/-CD4+T cells in colonic lamina propria, MLN and spleen (Figure 4c). Together, these data indicate that CD4+T cell intrinsic IL-18R1 signaling is dispensable for induction of intestinal inflammation upon adoptive transfer of naive CD4+T cells into a lymphopenic environment. Although colonic Foxp3+Treg cells expressed IL-18R1 during homeostasis (Figure 1d), IL-18R1-deficiency did not alter the frequency of this cellular population (Figure 2c). To address this question, we utilized a modification of the T cell transfer colitis model, whereby co-transfer of Foxp3+Treg cells prevents naive CD4+T cell-mediated wasting disease and intestinal inflammationNone. By contrast,Rag1-/-mice receiving naive CD4+T cells andIl18r1-/-Foxp3+Treg cells developed wasting disease and severe intestinal inflammation (Figure 6c-e). Thus, the inability ofIl18r1-/-Foxp3+Treg cells to suppress colitis was not due to inefficient reconstitution, loss of Foxp3 expression or failure to produce IL-10. Basal activation of innate immune pathways at mucosal surfaces, particularly within the gastrointestinal tract, is key for maintenance of tissue homeostasis. We focused our investigation to the modulation of intestinal CD4+T cell populations by IL-18, and the functional activities of this pathway during intestinal homeostasis and inflammation. Notably, absence of canonical IL-18R1-signalling resulted in elevated frequencies of colonic Th17 cells under homeostatic conditions. However, we cannot exclude the possibility of a cell-extrinsic role for IL-18R1-signalling, perhaps through Foxp3+Treg cell function, in control of colonic Th1 cell differentiation under homeostatic conditions. These observations may reflect some of the inherent differences between the inflammatory characteristics of experimental T cell transfer colitis in mice and Crohn's disease. Finally, we found that although IL-18R1 signals were dispensable for the differentiation of intestinal Foxp3+Treg cells during steady state, expression of IL-18R1 by Foxp3+Treg cells was essential for Treg cell suppression of intestinal inflammation in the T cell transfer colitis model.
