Under homeostatic conditions, IL-18R1-signaling limited colonic Th17 cell differentiation whereas during inflammation, Foxp3+Treg cell expression of IL-18R1 was critical for prevention of experimental colitis. To confirm these observationsin vivo, we performed flow cytometric analysis of IL-18R1 expression by CD4+T cells present under homeostatic conditions within the colonic lamina propria. Elevated frequencies of colonic effector CD4+T cells were not the result of a diminished Foxp3+Treg cell population, as Foxp3+Treg cell frequencies were equivalent betweenIl18-/-,Il18r1-/-and WT mice (Figure 2c). We next sought to determine the cellular source of IL-18 within the steady state intestine. In contrast to effector CD4+T subsets, Foxp3+Treg cell frequencies were unaffected by the absence of IEC-derived IL-18 (Figure 3d). Equivalent reconstitution of WT andIl18r1-/-B220+B cells, CD8+and CD4+T cells within the spleen, MLN and colonic lamina propria indicated thatIl18r1-deficiency did not generally effect lymphocyte reconstitution (Supplementary Figure 4a). Furthermore, IL-18R1-signaling limited Th17 cell differentiation solely within the colonic lamina propria, asIl18r1-/-CD4+T cells and WT CD4+T cells gave rise to comparable Th17 cell frequencies in the MLN and spleen (Figure 4c). In contrast, IL-18R1-signaling played a global role in promoting Th1 cell differentiation following lymphopenic expansion in this competitive chimeric environment, as significantly lower frequencies of Th1 cells were derived fromIl18r1-/-CD4+T cells in colonic lamina propria, MLN and spleen (Figure 4c). To investigate the mechanism by which IL-18 limits Th17 cell differentiation we performed parallelin vitrostudies. Expression of Rorgammat by IL-17A-producing cells confirmed these as Th17 cells (Supplementary Figure 4b), whereas T-bet and Foxp3 expression remained undetectable (unpublished data). Together, these data confirm that IL-18 acts directly on CD4+T cells to limit Th17 cell differentiation. In line with previous reportsNone,Il1r1-/-orMyd88-/-naive CD4+T cells co-cultured with BMDC under Th17 cell polarizing conditions yielded significantly decreased frequencies of Th17 cells when compared to WT naive CD4+T cells (Figure 4f,g). However, despite continued production of IL-18 by IEC during chronic colitis, we found equivalent levels of wasting disease and severe colitis inRag1-/-recipients of WT orIl18r1-/-naive CD4+T cells (Figure 5b,c). Although colonic Foxp3+Treg cells expressed IL-18R1 during homeostasis (Figure 1d), IL-18R1-deficiency did not alter the frequency of this cellular population (Figure 2c). Importantly, we observed equivalent levels of reconstitution and maintenance of Foxp3 expression by both WT andIl18r1-/-Foxp3+Treg cells (Figure 6f). Furthermore, Foxp3+IL-10+Treg cell frequencies were elevated in the absence of IL-18R1-signaling (Figure 6f), likely in response to the on-going intestinal inflammation (Figure 6d,e). IL-1beta promotes Th17 cell differentiation under homeostatic and inflammatory conditions, whilst IL-33 enhances colonic Foxp3+Treg cell function to limit intestinal inflammationNone,None,None. Homeostatic production of IL-18 by IEC and high IL-18R1 expression by colonic CD4+T cells led us to investigate the role of this axis in immune regulation in the steady state intestine. This indicates that the effects of IL-18 on intestinal T cell responses may vary depending on local conditions within the gut. Enriched IEC fractions were isolated by incubation of total colonic tissue in RPMI 1640, 5% FCS, 25mM EDTA for 15 min before collection of liberated intestinal epithelial cells. Naive CD4+T cell and dendritic cell co-culture was adopted from studies reported previouslyNone. Tissue homogenization was performed using a FastPrep 24 Homogenizer (MP Biomedicals, Burlingame, CA). Quantile normalised signal intensities were used for differential expression analysis implemented in LimmaNone. Total protein extracts were generated by homogenizing snap-frozen colonic tissue in RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Basel, Switzerland).
