Conversely, recent studies in mice lacking key inflammasome components that regulate the processing and secretion of IL-18, have proposed a tissue-protective role for IL-18 following injury to the intestinal epitheliumNone,None. Under homeostatic conditions, IL-18R1-signaling limited colonic Th17 cell differentiation whereas during inflammation, Foxp3+Treg cell expression of IL-18R1 was critical for prevention of experimental colitis. To determine the impact of IL-18 on colonic CD4+T cells, we assessed the frequency of colonic CD4+T cell subsets in bothIl18-/-andIl18r1-/-mice. Furthermore, IL-18R1-signaling limited Th17 cell differentiation solely within the colonic lamina propria, asIl18r1-/-CD4+T cells and WT CD4+T cells gave rise to comparable Th17 cell frequencies in the MLN and spleen (Figure 4c). In contrast, IL-18R1-signaling played a global role in promoting Th1 cell differentiation following lymphopenic expansion in this competitive chimeric environment, as significantly lower frequencies of Th1 cells were derived fromIl18r1-/-CD4+T cells in colonic lamina propria, MLN and spleen (Figure 4c). To assess the role of IL-18R1-signalling on colonic CD4+T cell differentiationin vivounder inflammatory conditions, we isolated colonic lamina propria leukocytes fromRag1-/-recipients that received WT orIl18r1-/-naive CD4+T cells and identified Th1, Th17 and Foxp3+T cell populations by flow cytometry. We observed similar frequencies of IL-17A+Th17 and IL-17A+IFN-gamma+double-producing CD4+T cells in the inflamed colons ofRag1-/-mice that received WT orIl18r1-/-naive CD4+T cells (Supplementary Figure 5a,b). Finally, the differentiation of small numbers of Foxp3+iTreg cells that occurs in this modelNonewas not dependent upon IL-18R1-signalling, asRag1-/-recipient mice receiving WT orIl18r1-/-naive CD4+T cells had equivalent frequencies of colonic Foxp3+iTreg cells (Supplementary Figure 5c). First, we analyzed IL-18R1 expression by Foxp3+Treg cells during control of colitis inRag1-/-mice that received both WT naive CD4+T cell and WT Foxp3+CD4+T cells. We next characterized the effects of IL-18R1-signaling on colonic Foxp3+Treg cells by comparing gene expression profiles of WT andIl18r1-/-Foxp3+Treg cells during prevention of colitis. Four weeks post transfer, colonic CD45.2+WT orIl18r1-/-Foxp3+Treg cells were isolated and comparative whole transcriptome analysis performed. IL-1beta promotes Th17 cell differentiation under homeostatic and inflammatory conditions, whilst IL-33 enhances colonic Foxp3+Treg cell function to limit intestinal inflammationNone,None,None. We now identify complementary roles for IL-18 in limitation of homeostatic Th17 cell differentiation and in promotion of Foxp3+Treg cell function to limit tissue pathology during experimental colitis. The commensal dysbiosis and elevated susceptibility to acute experimental DSS colitis observed in mice lacking Nod-like receptor (NLR) components, demonstrates the crucial role of inflammasome activation in maintenance of intestinal homeostasisNone,None,None. The protective effects of inflammasome activation in the intestine have been partly attributed to the production of IL-18, which may be important in restoring and maintaining epithelial barrier integrityNone,None. Conversely, evidence for a pathogenic role for IL-18 in experimental CD4+T cell mediated colitisNone, together with elevated tissue levels of IL-18 reported in patients with IBDNone,None, suggest this cytokine may contribute to chronic intestinal inflammation. Using both immunofluorescence and Western blotting, we observed production of IL-18 from E-cadherin+intestinal epithelial cells during homeostatic conditions, consistent with previous reports that a non-hematopoietic source of IL-18 promotes tissue protective responses during acute DSS colitisNone,None. A previous study provided evidence of a pathogenic role for IL-18 in the effector phase of T cell transfer colitis, as administration of a recombinant adenovirus expressing IL-18 antisense mRNA to mice with established colitis led to a reduction in intestinal pathologyNone. Finally, we found that although IL-18R1 signals were dispensable for the differentiation of intestinal Foxp3+Treg cells during steady state, expression of IL-18R1 by Foxp3+Treg cells was essential for Treg cell suppression of intestinal inflammation in the T cell transfer colitis model. For transcriptome analysis, 2*105CD45.1 CD4+CD25+cells were also transferred in order to prevent intestinal inflammation in hosts receivingIl18r1-/-Foxp3+Treg cells. Reactions were assayed in triplicate on a Chromo4 detection system (MJ Research, Waltham, MA) with expression levels for individual samples normalized relative toHprt1(Qiagen). Total RNA using RiboPure kit (Ambion, Austin, TX), amplified using TargetAmp 2-Round Biotin-aRNA Amplification Kit (Cambio, Cambridge, UK) and whole genome expression profiled using Single-Color MouseWG-6_V2BeadChip with direct hybridization assay (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Protein levels were normalized by Lowry assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA), resolved by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and analyzed with alpha-IL-18 (Abcam, ab71495) and alpha-tubulin (Santa Cruz, sc5286).
