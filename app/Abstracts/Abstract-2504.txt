Under homeostatic conditions, IL-18R1-signaling limited colonic Th17 cell differentiation whereas during inflammation, Foxp3+Treg cell expression of IL-18R1 was critical for prevention of experimental colitis. To confirm these observationsin vivo, we performed flow cytometric analysis of IL-18R1 expression by CD4+T cells present under homeostatic conditions within the colonic lamina propria. In accordance with elevated frequencies of colonic Th17 cells, colonic lamina propria leukocytes isolated fromIl18r1-/-mice and stimulated with alpha-CD3 produced significantly more IL-17A, but not GM-CSF or IL-22, when compared to WT controls (Figure 2d). We next sought to determine the cellular source of IL-18 within the steady state intestine. Furthermore, transcriptional analyses demonstrated thatIl18gene expression by intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) was elevated in the presence of commensal microbesNone. In contrast to effector CD4+T subsets, Foxp3+Treg cell frequencies were unaffected by the absence of IEC-derived IL-18 (Figure 3d). Equivalent reconstitution of WT andIl18r1-/-B220+B cells, CD8+and CD4+T cells within the spleen, MLN and colonic lamina propria indicated thatIl18r1-deficiency did not generally effect lymphocyte reconstitution (Supplementary Figure 4a). In contrast, IL-18R1-signaling played a global role in promoting Th1 cell differentiation following lymphopenic expansion in this competitive chimeric environment, as significantly lower frequencies of Th1 cells were derived fromIl18r1-/-CD4+T cells in colonic lamina propria, MLN and spleen (Figure 4c). To investigate the mechanism by which IL-18 limits Th17 cell differentiation we performed parallelin vitrostudies. Together, these data confirm that IL-18 acts directly on CD4+T cells to limit Th17 cell differentiation. We therefore sought to address the seemingly opposing roles of IL-1beta and IL-18 on Th17 cell differentiation. We observed similar frequencies of IL-17A+Th17 and IL-17A+IFN-gamma+double-producing CD4+T cells in the inflamed colons ofRag1-/-mice that received WT orIl18r1-/-naive CD4+T cells (Supplementary Figure 5a,b). Furthermore, although the frequencies of IFN-gamma+Th1 cells were slightly decreased in the colons ofRag1-/-mice receivingIl18r1-/-naive CD4+T cells when compared to those receiving WT naive CD4+T cells, this was not statistically significant (Supplementary Figure 5a,b). Finally, the differentiation of small numbers of Foxp3+iTreg cells that occurs in this modelNonewas not dependent upon IL-18R1-signalling, asRag1-/-recipient mice receiving WT orIl18r1-/-naive CD4+T cells had equivalent frequencies of colonic Foxp3+iTreg cells (Supplementary Figure 5c). Although colonic Foxp3+Treg cells expressed IL-18R1 during homeostasis (Figure 1d), IL-18R1-deficiency did not alter the frequency of this cellular population (Figure 2c). IL-1beta promotes Th17 cell differentiation under homeostatic and inflammatory conditions, whilst IL-33 enhances colonic Foxp3+Treg cell function to limit intestinal inflammationNone,None,None. However, we observed discordant levels of IL-18R1 expression by distinct effector and regulatory intestinal CD4+T cell subsets, with highest expression by colonic Th17 cells. The factors that regulate IL-18 production by IEC require additional investigation, but it has been reported that commensal microbes may augmentIl18gene expression by IECNone. Homeostatic production of IL-18 by IEC and high IL-18R1 expression by colonic CD4+T cells led us to investigate the role of this axis in immune regulation in the steady state intestine. In accordance with a cell-intrinsic role for canonical IL-18R1-signalling in limiting Th17 cell differentiation, addition of IL-18 decreased the efficiency of Th17 cell differentiation by acting directly on CD4+T cells. This indicates that the effects of IL-18 on intestinal T cell responses may vary depending on local conditions within the gut. However, our results suggest that, during intestinal inflammation, IEC-derived IL-18 contributes to a negative feedback loop to regulate intestinal inflammation by promoting optimal function of Foxp3+Treg cells. Naive CD4+T cell and dendritic cell co-culture was adopted from studies reported previouslyNone. Total protein extracts were generated by homogenizing snap-frozen colonic tissue in RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Basel, Switzerland).
