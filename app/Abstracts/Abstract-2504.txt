To confirm these observationsin vivo, we performed flow cytometric analysis of IL-18R1 expression by CD4+T cells present under homeostatic conditions within the colonic lamina propria. In accordance with elevated frequencies of colonic Th17 cells, colonic lamina propria leukocytes isolated fromIl18r1-/-mice and stimulated with alpha-CD3 produced significantly more IL-17A, but not GM-CSF or IL-22, when compared to WT controls (Figure 2d). By contrast, colonic lamina propria leukocytes isolated fromIl18r1-/-mice did not produce significantly higher levels of IFN-gammaex vivo(Figure 2d), likely reflecting additional sources of IFN-gamma besides Th1 cells. In addition, expression of genes encoding the antimicrobial peptides S100A8 and S100A9 induced by IL-17A, but not IL-22-induced Reg3gamma, were significantly elevated in colonic tissue ofIl18r1-/-mice when compared to WT controls (Figure 2e). Equivalent reconstitution of WT andIl18r1-/-B220+B cells, CD8+and CD4+T cells within the spleen, MLN and colonic lamina propria indicated thatIl18r1-deficiency did not generally effect lymphocyte reconstitution (Supplementary Figure 4a). Furthermore, IL-18R1-signaling limited Th17 cell differentiation solely within the colonic lamina propria, asIl18r1-/-CD4+T cells and WT CD4+T cells gave rise to comparable Th17 cell frequencies in the MLN and spleen (Figure 4c). In contrast, IL-18R1-signaling played a global role in promoting Th1 cell differentiation following lymphopenic expansion in this competitive chimeric environment, as significantly lower frequencies of Th1 cells were derived fromIl18r1-/-CD4+T cells in colonic lamina propria, MLN and spleen (Figure 4c). To assess the role of IL-18R1-signaling in induction of CD4+T cell mediated intestinal inflammation, we utilized the T cell transfer colitis model, whereby severe colitis and wasting disease are induced by reconstitution of lymphopenic hosts with naive CD4+T cellsNone. Immunofluorescence analysis of colonic tissue fromRag1-/-mice adoptively transferred with WT naive CD4+T cells demonstrated that IEC remain the major source of IL-18 within the inflamed colon, with IL-18 staining largely restricted to E-cadherin+cells of the intestinal epithelium (Figure 5a). To assess the role of IL-18R1-signalling on colonic CD4+T cell differentiationin vivounder inflammatory conditions, we isolated colonic lamina propria leukocytes fromRag1-/-recipients that received WT orIl18r1-/-naive CD4+T cells and identified Th1, Th17 and Foxp3+T cell populations by flow cytometry. Furthermore, although the frequencies of IFN-gamma+Th1 cells were slightly decreased in the colons ofRag1-/-mice receivingIl18r1-/-naive CD4+T cells when compared to those receiving WT naive CD4+T cells, this was not statistically significant (Supplementary Figure 5a,b). Finally, the differentiation of small numbers of Foxp3+iTreg cells that occurs in this modelNonewas not dependent upon IL-18R1-signalling, asRag1-/-recipient mice receiving WT orIl18r1-/-naive CD4+T cells had equivalent frequencies of colonic Foxp3+iTreg cells (Supplementary Figure 5c). Although colonic Foxp3+Treg cells expressed IL-18R1 during homeostasis (Figure 1d), IL-18R1-deficiency did not alter the frequency of this cellular population (Figure 2c). Four weeks post transfer, 86.0 +/- 8.1% of colonic Foxp3+Treg cells were IL-18R1+(Figure 6a,b), suggesting a functional role for IL-18R1-signalling in control of colitis. Furthermore, Foxp3+IL-10+Treg cell frequencies were elevated in the absence of IL-18R1-signaling (Figure 6f), likely in response to the on-going intestinal inflammation (Figure 6d,e). Homeostatic production of IL-18 by IEC and high IL-18R1 expression by colonic CD4+T cells led us to investigate the role of this axis in immune regulation in the steady state intestine. Although expression of IL-18R1 by colonic Th17 cells suggested that IL-18 could act directly on this cell population to limit their differentiation, we also considered the possibility that the absence of functional IL-18R1-signaling in another leukocyte population (for example, in Foxp3+Treg cells) may have indirectly led to the increased frequency of colonic Th17 cells. In contrast to the clear inhibitory effects of IL-18R1 signaling on intestinal Th17 differentiation, we observed opposing effects of IL-18R1 ablation on colonic Th1 cell development under homeostatic conditions and in the competitive bone marrow chimeras. We also addressed the role of the IL-18/IL-18R1-signaling axis in the induction and regulation of CD4+T cell mediated intestinal inflammation. Mechanistic analyses demonstrated that although IL-18R1 signaling did not affect Treg cell reconstitution, maintenance of Foxp3 expression or IL-10 production, canonical IL-18R1-signaling promoted expression of a number of key Foxp3+Treg cell effector molecules previously demonstrated to be critical for control of colitis by Treg cells, includingFurin, Bcl11b, Tnfrsf4andStat3None-None.
