Demonstrate that the tendon of palmar long can be estimated in relation to its length and width before using it as a graft in surgical procedure. There were examined 60 forearms of 30 corpses of black ethnicity; measure the length and width of the tendon of the palmaris longus muscle and compared the length of the forearm. There are notes their absence unilateral right in two female corpses. The medium length and width were more or less respectively 11.9, 15.2 mm and 4.1 + 1.5 mm. The total average forearm length of 275.4 was more or less 17.9 mm. There is a significant relationship between the length of the tendon and the length of the forearm; so we can evaluate the size of the tendon of the palmaris longus muscle when it is necessary to use it for grafts.
