The relative extent of cell mixing in tissues of mouse chimaeras or mosaics can be studied by comparing the distributions of the two cell populations in the tissues. However, the mean patch size is misleading because it is affected by both the extent of cell mixing and the relative contributions of the two cell populations. Previous work suggested that effects attributable to differences in tissue composition among chimaeras can be factored out either by correcting the mean patch size or by using the median patch size for the minority cell population and restricting the analysis to grossly unbalanced chimaeras. In the present study, computer simulations of two-dimensional mosaic arrays of black and white squares (representing cells) were used to simulate chimaeric tissues. Random arrays simulated tissues with extensive cell mixing, arrays of cell clumps (representing coherent clones) simulated less mixed tissues, and striped arrays simulated tissues with elongated but fragmented descendent clones. The computer simulations predicted that (i) the median patch length (minority cell population) and the corrected mean patch length would both distinguish between random and clumped patterns and (ii) differences in the variation of the composition of two perpendicular series of one-dimensional transects would distinguished between stripes and randomly orientated patches. Both predictions were confirmed by analysis of histological sections of the retinal pigment epithelium from fetal and adult mouse chimaeras. This study demonstrates that two types of non-random two-dimensional variegated patterns (clumps and stripes) can be identified in chimaeras without two-dimensional reconstruction of serial sections.
