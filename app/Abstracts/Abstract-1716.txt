The genesis of beta-cells predominantly occurs through self-replication; therefore, understanding the regulation of cell proliferation is essential. We previously showed that the lack of nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) DNA repair factor ligase IV leads to an accumulation of DNA damage that permanently halts beta-cell proliferation and dramatically decreases insulin production, causing overt diabetes in a hypomorphic p53
