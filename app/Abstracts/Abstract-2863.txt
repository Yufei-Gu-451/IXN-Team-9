Although an association between psychosocial distress (depression, anxiety, somatization, and perceived stress) and voice disorders has been observed, little is known about the relationship between distress and patient-reported voice handicap. Further, the psychological mechanisms underlying this relationship are poorly understood. Perceived control plays an important role in distress associated with other medical disorders. The objectives of this study were to 1) characterize the relationship between distress and patient-reported voice handicap and 2) examine the role of perceived control in this relationship. Cross-sectional study in tertiary care academic voice clinic. Distress, perceived stress, voice handicap, and perceived control were measured using established assessment scales. Association was measured with Pearson's correlation coefficient; moderation was assessed using multiple hierarchical regression. 533 patients enrolled. 34% met criteria for clinically significant distress (i.e., depression, anxiety, and/or somatization). A weak association (r=0.13, p=0.003) was observed between severity of psychosocial distress and vocal handicap. Present perceived control was inversely associated with distress (r=-0.41, p less than 0.0001), stress (r=-0.30, p less than 0.0001), and voice handicap (r=-0.30, p less than 0.0001). The relationship between voice handicap and psychosocial distress was moderated by perceived control (b for interaction term -0.15, p less than 0.001); greater vocal handicap was associated with greater distress in patients with low perceived control. Severity of distress and vocal handicap were positively related, and the relation between them was moderated by perceived control. Vocal handicap was more related to distress among those with low perceived control; targeting this potential mechanism may facilitate new approaches for improved care.
