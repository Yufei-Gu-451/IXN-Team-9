The development of androgen independence, chemo-, and radioresistance are critical markers of prostate cancer progression and the predominant reasons for its high mortality. Understanding the resistance to therapy could aid the development of more effective treatments. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-2 (IGFBP-2) on prostate cancer cell proliferation and its effects on the response to docetaxel. DU145 and PC3 cells were treated with IGFBP-2, insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) alone or in combination with blockade of the IGF-I receptor or integrin receptors. Cells were also treated with IGFBP-2 short interfering ribonucleic acid with or without a PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10) inhibitor or docetaxel. Tritiated thymidine incorporation was used to measure cell proliferation and Trypan blue cell counting for cell death. Levels of IGFBP-2 mRNA were measured using RT-PCR. Abundance and phosphorylation of proteins were assessed using western immunoblotting. The IGFBP-2 promoted cell growth in both cell lines but with PC3 cells this was in an IGF-dependent manner, whereas with DU145 cells the effect was independent of IGF receptor activation. This IGF-independent effect of IGFBP-2 was mediated by interaction withThe IGFBP-2 has a key role in the growth of prostate cancer cells, and silencing IGFBP-2 expression reduced the resistance of these cells to docetaxel. Targeting IGFBP-2 may increase the efficacy of docetaxel.
