In patients presenting with a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can support and substitute clinical information for multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis demonstrating disease dissemination in space (DIS) and time (DIT) and helping to rule out other conditions that can mimic MS. From their inclusion in the diagnostic work-up for MS in 2001, several modifications of MRI diagnostic criteria have been proposed, in the attempt to simplify lesion-count models for demonstrating DIS, change the timing of MRI scanning for demonstrating DIT, and increase the value of spinal cord imaging. Since the last update of these criteria, new data regarding the application of MRI for demonstrating DIS and DIT have become available and improvement in MRI technology has occurred. State-of-the-art MRI findings in these patients were discussed in a MAGNIMS workshop, the goal of which was to provide an evidence-based and expert-opinion consensus on diagnostic MRI criteria modifications.
