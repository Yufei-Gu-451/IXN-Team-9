Guidelines for genetic testing forWe provided both referral-based and Jewish population-based testing between 2008 and 2012. We compared the numbers of BRCA mutation carriers identified through the two streams and estimated the number of genetic counselling hours devoted to each programme. From 2008 to 2012, 38 female carriers were identified through 487 referrals to our genetics centre (29 unaffected with cancer). During the same time, 6179 Jewish women were tested through our population-based programme and 93 mutation carriers were identified (92 unaffected with cancer). Fewer counsellor hours were devoted to the population-based than to the clinical referral-based testing programme. Genetic testing of all Jewish women above the age of 25 years will greatly expand the number of BRCA mutation carriers identified without a commensurate increase in the number of hours required for counselling.
