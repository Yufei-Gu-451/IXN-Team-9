Excess visceral fat accumulation is associated with the metabolic disturbances of obesity. Differential lipid redistribution through lipoproteins may affect body fat distribution. This is the first study to investigate VLDL-triglyceride (VLDL-TG) storage in visceral fat. Nine upper-body obese (UBO; waist circumference 88 cm) and six lean (waist circumference 80 cm) women scheduled for elective tubal ligation surgery were studied. VLDL-TG storage in visceral, upper-body subcutaneous (UBSQ), and lower-body subcutaneous (LBSQ) fat were measured with [9,10-VLDL-TG storage in visceral fat accounted for only ?0.8% of VLDL-TG turnover in UBO and lean women, respectively. A significantly larger proportion of VLDL-TG turnover was stored in UBSQ (?5%) and LBSQ (?4%) fat. The VLDL-TG fractional storage was similar in UBO and lean women for all regional depots. VLDL-TG fractional storage and VLDL-TG concentration were correlated in UBO women in UBSQ fat (VLDL-TG storage efficiency is similar in all regional fat depots, and trafficking of VLDL-TG into different adipose tissue depots is similar in UBO and lean women. Postabsorptive VLDL-TG storage is unlikely to be of major importance in the development of preferential upper-body fat distribution in obese women.
