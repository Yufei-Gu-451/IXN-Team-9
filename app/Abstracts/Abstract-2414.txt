Kruppel-like Factor 14 (KLF14) proteins function as epigenetic reprogramming factors during cell differentiation in many cell populations and in engineered induced pluripotent stem cells. In this study, we determined the function of KLF14 in the regulation of forkhead box protein 3 (FOXP3), a transcription factor critical for T regulatory (Treg) cell differentiation. We studied the effects of KLF14 on FOXP3 expression at the level of the protein and mRNA. We evaluated the functional relevance of KLF14 to FOXP3KLF14, induced upon activation of naive CD4These results outline a novel mechanism by which KLF14 regulates Treg cell differentiation via chromatin remodeling at the FOXP3 TSDR. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence to support a role for KLF14 in maintaining the differentiated state of Treg cells, with an outline of a potential mechanism to modify the expression of immune genes such as FOXP3 that are critical to T-cell fate.
