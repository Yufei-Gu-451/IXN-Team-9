Inflammatory mediators may have decisive roles at different stages of tumour development. Mediators within the pentraxin family may be used as strong biomarkers in prognosis of advanced pancreatic carcinoma patients. Using pancreatic carcinoma cell lines and gene transfectant, we measured long pentraxin (PTX3) level in culture solution and carried out cellular migration assayElevated PTX3 production was observed in several cell lines, and a direct relationship between migratory activity and PTX3 level was identifiedPentraxin family members, especially PTX3, may be used as promising biomarkers in the prognosis of pancreatic carcinoma patients.
