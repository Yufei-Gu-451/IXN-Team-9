Pancreatic cancer is an aggressive cancer of the digestive system, which is becoming a serious health problem worldwide. Overall survival for patients with pancreatic cancer is poor, mainly due to a lack of biomarkers to enable early diagnosis and a lack of prognostic markers that can inform decision-making, facilitating personalized treatment and an optimal clinical outcome. ncRNAs play an important role in pancreatic carcinogenesis. Here we review the literature on the role of ncRNAs as biomarkers in pancreatic cancer. We focus on the significance of ncRNAs as markers for early diagnosis, as prognostic biomarkers able to inform clinical management and as targets for novel therapeutics for patients with pancreatic cancer.
