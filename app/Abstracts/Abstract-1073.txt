Previous studies have demonstrated that Fyn knockout (FynKO) mice on a standard chow diet display increased glucose clearance and whole-body insulin sensitivity associated with decreased adiposity resulting from increased fatty acid use and energy expenditure. Surprisingly, however, despite a similar extent of adipose tissue (AT) mass accumulation on a high-fat diet, the FynKO mice remained fully glucose tolerant and insulin sensitive. Physiologic analyses demonstrated that the FynKO mice had a combination of skewed AT expansion into the subcutaneous compartment rather than to the visceral depot, reduced AT inflammation associated with reduced T-cell and macrophage infiltration, and increased proportion of anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages. These data demonstrate that Fyn is an important regulator of whole-body integrative metabolism that coordinates AT expansion, inflammation, and insulin sensitivity in states of nutrient excess. These data further suggest that inhibition of Fyn function may provide a novel target to prevent AT inflammation, insulin resistance, and the dyslipidemia components of the metabolic syndrome.
