Few controlled trials compared second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) with first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs) regarding relapse prevention in schizophrenia. We conducted a systematic review/meta-analysis of randomized trials, lasting greater than =6 months comparing SGAs with FGAs in schizophrenia. Primary outcome was study-defined relapse; secondary outcomes included relapse at 3, 6 and 12 months, treatment failure, hospitalization, and dropout due to any cause, non-adherence and intolerability. Pooled relative risk (RR) [+/-95%CIs] was calculated using random-effects model, with numbers-needed-to-treat (NNT) calculations where appropriate. Across 23 studies (n=4,504, mean duration=61.9+/-22.4 weeks), none of the individual SGAs outperformed FGAs (mainly haloperidol) regarding study-defined relapse, except for isolated, single trial-based superiority, and except for risperidone's superiority at 3 and 6 months when requiring greater than /=3 trials. Grouped together, however, SGAs prevented relapse more than FGAs (29.0% vs. 37.5%, RR=0.80, CI:0.70-0.91, p=.0007, I
