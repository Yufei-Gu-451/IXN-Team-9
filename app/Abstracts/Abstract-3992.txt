To determine the effect of adding cilostazol (100 mg b.i.d.) to standard-dose clopidogrel (75 mg/d) (TRIPLE) compared with double-dose clopidogrel (150 mg/d) (DOUBLE) and the influence of the cytochrome P450 (T2DM patients were treated with TRIPLE (TRIPLE versus DOUBLE showed greater DeltaMPAAmong T2DM patients, adding cilostazol achieves greater platelet inhibition compared with clopidogrel (150 mg/d), which is not influenced by genetic polymorphisms.
