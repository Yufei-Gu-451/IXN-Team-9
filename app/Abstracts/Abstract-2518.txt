Progesterone (P4) has emerged as an important hormone regulating mammary stem cell populations. In breast cancer, P4 and synthetic analogs increase the number of stem-like cells within luminal estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) positive breast cancers. These cells gain expression of de-differentiated cell markers CD44 and cytokeratin 5 (CK5), lose luminal markers ER and PR, and are more therapy resistant. We previously described that P4-downregulation of microRNA (miR)-29a contributes to the expansion of CD44
