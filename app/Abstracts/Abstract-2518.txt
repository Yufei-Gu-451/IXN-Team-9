We previously demonstrated that progestin suppression of miR-29 family members facilitates induction of the transcription factor KLF4 and potentiates the expansion of CD44+and CK5+breast cancer cells (24). Here we demonstrate that miR-141 inhibition enhanced the P4-mediated increase in CD44highand CK5+cells. miR-141 directly targeted PR and Stat5a, a transcription factor and P4-regulated gene (29,30) that regulates the mammary luminal progenitor population (31). To confirm P4-mediated regulation of miR-141, luminal breast cancer cell lines T47D, BT474, and ZR75-1 were treated with vehicle (ethanol) or 100 nM P4 for 6 or 24 h, and mature miR-141 levels measured by qPCR. qPCR with primers specific to pri-miR-141 or pri-miR-200c (provided inSupplementary Figure 4a) found that both transcripts decreased at 6 h post P4 treatment, and were blocked by RU486 (Figure 1d). P4 treatment alone increased mammosphere formation of SCR-ZIP cells (Figure 3a). PR protein expression significantly increased in three different luminal breast cancer cell lines (T47D, BT474, and ZR75-1) with miR-141 inhibition (141-ZIP) (Figure 4a;Figure 2d). Expression of both PRA and PRB protein was reduced by miR-141 mimic but not control (Figure 4d). These data confirm that PR expression levels can be directly altered by miR-141 targeting of PR transcripts. We therefore investigated Stat5a regulation by miR-141 and its involvement in the P4 expansion of stem-like cells. Treatment with a miR-141 mimic blocked P4-mediated Stat5 upregulation (Figure 5a). We also analyzed a predicted miR-141 site in Stat5b and found no significant regulation (Supplementary Figure 5). The P4-mediated increase in CK5 expression was significantly inhibited in the presence of siSTAT5A (Figure 5d). Likewise, Pimozide reduced the P4 induction of CD44highcells by half (Figure 6c). In breast cancer these include miR-200 or miR-205 targeting of EMT and stem cell promoting transcription factors Zeb1/2, Suz12, TWIST1, and BMI1 (17-21,51,52). Stable inhibition of miR-141 was in fact sufficient to induce PR expression in breast cancer cell lines that typically require E2/ER-dependent PR expression (Figure 4). We also demonstrate that miR-141 targets both PR-A and PR-B at a site within the last coding exon mapped by genome-wide analysis of miRNA binding sites in luminal breast cancer cells (37). Stat5a is also targeted by miR-141 in the bovine mammary gland (53). Stat5 is activated by another P4-regulated gene, prolactin receptor (PRLR). Prolactin (PRL) has been shown to reduce the P4 increase in CK5+breast cancer cells, potentially though blocking induction of the transcriptional repressor BCL6 (55). Thus, interplay between PR-Stat5a-PRLR signaling in regulating the breast cancer CK5+population requires further investigation, and could be a source for therapeutic intervention. Conversely, both PR- and Stat5a-null animals exhibit reduced mammary tumorigenesis in murine models (1,39); this could be due to reduced stem/progenitor cell populations.
