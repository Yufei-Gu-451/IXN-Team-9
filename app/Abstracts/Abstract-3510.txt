To determine the subunit expression and functional activation of phagocyte-like NADPH oxidase (Nox), reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and caspase-3 activation in the Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rat and diabetic human islets. Expression of core components of Nox was quantitated by Western blotting and densitometry. ROS levels were quantitated by the 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate method. Rac1 activation was quantitated using the gold-labeled immunosorbent assay kit. Levels of phosphorylated p47We provide the first in vitro and in vivo evidence in support of an accelerated Rac1-Nox-ROS-JNK1/2 signaling pathway in the islet beta-cell leading to the onset of mitochondrial dysregulation in diabetes.
