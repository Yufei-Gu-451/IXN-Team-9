The effects of androgens on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in men remain unclear. To better characterize the relationship between androgens and HDL, we investigated the effects of testosterone replacement on HDL protein composition and serum HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux in hypogonadal men. Twenty-three older hypogonadal men (ages 51-83, baseline testosterone less than 280 ng/dl) were administered replacement testosterone therapy (1% transdermal gel) with or without the 5alpha-reductase inhibitor dutasteride. At baseline and after three months of treatment, we determined fasting lipid concentrations, HDL protein composition, and the cholesterol efflux capacity of serum HDL. Testosterone replacement did not affect HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) concentrations but conferred significant increases in HDL-associated paraoxonase 1 (PON1) and fibrinogen alpha chain (FGA) (
