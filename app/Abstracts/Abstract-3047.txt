Discontinuous Bessel integrals are applied to a boundary value problem related to chronoamperometry, with zero concentration at the disk satisfied on the average and the zero flux at the shroud satisfied approximately only. Current functions are derived, series expansion at long time and asymptotic expansion at short times are given. Plots of numerical calculations of current functions are presented.
