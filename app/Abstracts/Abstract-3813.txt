A common approach to screening for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is the universal testing of all pregnant women with a 1-h, 50-g glucose challenge test (GCT), followed by a diagnostic oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in those in whom the GCT is positive ( greater than =7.8 mmol/L). More important, the GCT is performed at any time of day, but there has been limited study of the effect of time of day on test performance. Thus, using their subsequent OGTT (performed in the morning), we sought to characterize the metabolic function of women with positive GCTs in relation to the timing of their test. A total of 927 women with positive GCTs underwent a 3-h 100-g OGTT. They were stratified into four groups by time of day (hours) of their GCT: less than 0900 (On the OGTT, the prevalence of GDM progressively decreased across the GCT groups from 0900 h (26.9%) to 0900-1059 h (25.0%) to 1100-1259 h (21.7%) to =1300 h (21.5%;Among women with a positive GCT, those tested in the afternoon have better metabolic function and a lower risk of GDM on subsequent OGTT.
