Genetic diversity assessment plays an important role in plant improvement. It becomes more significant when evaluation is done at different ploidy and geographical origin levels. The present study provides a better understanding of the genetic association of Indian and Turkish hexaploid and tetraploid wheat. The Turkish hexaploid population demonstrated its close association with Indian hexaploid and tetraploid varieties. This confirmed their relatedness within the diverse gene pool. The results revealed in this study can be effectively used by breeders and evolutionary biologists for the development of genetically diverse, promising and healthier wheat varieties. Genetic diversity among plant species offers prospects for improving the plant characteristics. Its assessment is necessary to help tackle the threats of environmental fluctuations and for the effective exploitation of genetic resources in breeding programmes. Although wheat is one of the most thoroughly studied crops in terms of genetic polymorphism studies, phylogenetic affinities of Indian and Turkish
