Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) has been linked to several neurological conditions including: epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, headache, multiple sclerosis, and sleep disturbances, predominantly through case reports and series that lack comparison groups. Our objective was to assess whether specific neurological conditions occur more frequently in individuals with NF1 vs. those without NF1. We used the 2006-2010 MarketScanCompared to the non-NF1 group (n=85,790), the NF1 group (n=8,579) had a significantly higher odds of health insurance claims for epilepsy (OR=7.3; 95% CI 6.4-8.3), Parkinson's disease (OR=3.1; 95% CI 1.3-7.5), headache (OR=2.9, 95% CI 2.6-3.1), multiple sclerosis (OR=1.9, 95% CI 1.2-2.9), and sleep disturbances/disorder (OR=1.4, 95% CI 1.2-3.6). This large study provides strong evidence for positive associations between several neurological conditions and NF1.
