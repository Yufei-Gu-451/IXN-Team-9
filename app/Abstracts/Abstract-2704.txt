Interferon (IFN)-alpha treatment for infectious diseases and cancer is associated with significant depressive symptoms that can limit therapeutic efficacy. Multiple mechanisms have been implicated in IFN-alpha-induced depression including immune, neuroendocrine and neurotransmitter pathways. To further explore mechanisms of IFN-alpha-induced depression and establish associated genetic risk factors, single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes encoding proteins previously implicated in IFN-alpha-induced depression were explored in 2 self-reported ethnic groups, Caucasians (n=800) and African Americans (n=232), participating in a clinical trial on the impact of three pegylated IFN-alpha treatment regimens on sustained viral response in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Prior to treatment, all subjects were free of psychotropic medications and had a score less than =20 on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), which was used to assess depressive symptom severity throughout the study. In Caucasians, a polymorphism (rs9657182) in the promoter region of the gene encoding indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (
