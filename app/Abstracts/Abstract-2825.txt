Increased insulin demand resulting from insulin resistance and/or overnutrition induces a compensatory increase in beta-cell mass. The physiological factors responsible for the compensation have not been fully characterized. In zebrafish, overnutrition rapidly induces compensatory beta-cell differentiation through triggering the release of a paracrine signal from persistently activated beta-cells. We identified Fgf1 signaling as a key component of the overnutrition-induced beta-cell differentiation signal in a small molecule screen. Fgf1 was confirmed as the overnutrition-induced beta-cell differentiation signal, as inactivation of
