Although significant progress has been made in understanding the importance of Wnt signaling in the initiation of colorectal cancer, less is known about responses that accompany the reversal of oncogenic Wnt signaling. The aim of this study was to analyzeA tetracycline-inducible transgenic mouse model expressing truncated beta-catenin (DeltaN89beta-catenin) that exhibited a strong intestinal hyperplasia was analysed during the removal of oncogenic beta-catenin expression both in 3D 'crypt culture' andIn conclusion, these results demonstrate that the reversal of Wnt signaling by inhibitors should ideally be studied within hours of treatment. The reversible system described, involving medium throughput
