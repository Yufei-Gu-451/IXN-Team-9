Transient receptor potential vanilloid type 4 (TRPV4) and calcium-activated potassium channels (KWe investigated osmosensing roles for TRPV4 and KHypotonic saline reduced action current frequency in hypothalamic slices; a response mimicked by TRPV4 channel agonists 4aPDD (1?uM) and GSK1016790A (100?nM), and blocked by inhibitors of either TRPV4 channels (RN1734 (5?uM) and HC067047 (300?nM) or the low-conductance calcium-activated potassium (SK) channel (UCL-1684 30?nM); iberiotoxin and TRAM-34 had no effect. Our model was compatible with coupling between TRPV4 and KThere was functional coupling between TRPV4 and SK channels in parvocellular neurones. This mechanism contributes to osmosensing in the PVN and may provide a novel pharmacological target for the cardiovascular or renal systems.
