To investigate factors associated with bone mineral density (BMD) in type 1 diabetes by classic statistic and artificial neural networks. A total of 175 eugonadal type 1 diabetic patients (age 32.8 +/- 8.4 years) and 151 age- and BMI-matched control subjects (age 32.6 +/- 4.5 years) were studied. In all subjects, BMI and BMD (asLS- and F-BMD levels were lower in patients (-0.11 +/- 1.2 and -0.32 +/- 1.4, respectively) than in control subjects (0.59 +/- 1,In type 1 diabetes, low BMD is associated with low BMI and low ClCr and high DID. Chronic complications negatively influence BMD.
