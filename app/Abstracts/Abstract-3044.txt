A closed system hot filament chemical vapor deposition (CVD) reactor has been used to deposit diamond films on silicon substrates. A fixed charge of hydrogen gas is fed into the deposition system until the desired deposition pressure level is reached. A solid graphite cylindrical rod held above the tungsten filament was the carbon source. System parameters for diamond film growth have been determined. The diamond structure of the films has been verified by x-ray diffraction (XRD). Morphology typical of CVD diamond films has been observed in scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The quality of the diamond films has been evaluated by micro-Raman spectroscopy.
