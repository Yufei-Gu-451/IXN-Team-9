A key step in many perceptual decision tasks is the integration of sensory inputs over time, but a fundamental questions remain about how this is accomplished in neural circuits. One possibility is to balance decay modes of membranes and synapses with recurrent excitation. To allow integration over long timescales, however, this balance must be exceedingly precise. The need for fine tuning can be overcome via a "robust integrator" mechanism in which momentary inputs must be above a preset limit to be registered by the circuit. The degree of this limiting embodies a tradeoff between sensitivity to the input stream and robustness against parameter mistuning. Here, we analyze the consequences of this tradeoff for decision-making performance. For concreteness, we focus on the well-studied random dot motion discrimination task and constrain stimulus parameters by experimental data. We show that mistuning feedback in an integrator circuit decreases decision performance but that the robust integrator mechanism can limit this loss. Intriguingly, even for perfectly tuned circuits with no immediate need for a robustness mechanism, including one often does not impose a substantial penalty for decision-making performance. The implication is that robust integrators may be well suited to subserve the basic function of evidence integration in many cognitive tasks. We develop these ideas using simulations of coupled neural units and the mathematics of sequential analysis.
