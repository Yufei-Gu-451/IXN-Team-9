Ubiquitin-specific protease 18 inhibits ubiquitination of TAK1-TAB complexes to restrict IL-2 production and promote Th17 differentiation and autoimmune responses. Reversible ubiquitin modification of cell signaling molecules has emerged as a critical mechanism by which cells respond to extracellular stimuli. Although ubiquitination of TGF-beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) is critical for NF-kappaB activation in T cells, the regulation of its deubiquitination is unclear. We show that USP18, which was previously reported to be important in regulating type I interferon signaling in innate immunity, regulates T cell activation and T helper 17 (Th17) cell differentiation by deubiquitinating the TAK1-TAB1 complex. USP18-deficient T cells are defective in Th17 differentiation and
