Insulin resistance (IR) increases cardiovascular morbidity and is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. IR is now recognized to be present in type 1 diabetes; however, its relationship with mitochondrial function is unknown. We determined the relationship between IR and muscle mitochondrial function in type 1 diabetes using the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp and
