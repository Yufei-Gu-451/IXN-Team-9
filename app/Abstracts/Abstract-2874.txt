Expenditures for postacute care in total joint arthroplasty (TJA) have risen dramatically over recent decades. Therefore, efforts are underway to better identify cost savings in postacute rehabilitation centers, such as skilled nursing facilities (SNFs). The primary purpose of this study was to analyze gait training achievements in post-TJA patients in the interval between hospital discharge and the patients' first 4 days at the SNF. Identification of potential losses in therapeutic progress may lead the way for improved patient care, outcomes, and cost savings. Our hypothesis is that patients discharged to an SNF will have a decline in gait achievements upon transfer from the hospital. A total of 68 patients who underwent TJA were included. The total distance ambulated during physical therapy (PT) was recorded for the last day of hospital therapy and the first 4 days at the SNF as well as the reported visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores. There was a 73% decline in distance ambulated on SNF day 0 (There was a significant decline in ambulatory proficiency in post-TJA patients on the day of and the day following hospital discharge to an SNF. These deficits cannot be attributed to heightened pain levels. Early and progressive ambulation is a recognized component of appropriate PT following TJA. This study therefore highlights the transition from hospital to SNF as a crucial and novel target for improvement in post-TJA care.
