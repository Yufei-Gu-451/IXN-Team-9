In colorectal cancer (CRC), tumour microsatellite instability (MSI) status and CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) status are indicators of patient outcome, but the molecular events that give rise to these outcomes remain largely unknown. Wnt5a is a critical regulator of non-canonical Wnt activity and promoter hypermethylation of this gene has emerging prognostic roles in CRC; however the frequency and prognostic significance of this epigenetic event have not been explored in the context of colorectal tumour subtype. Consequently, we investigated the frequency and prognostic significance ofMethylation was quantified in a large cohort of 1232 colorectal carcinomas from two clinically distinct populations from Canada. Associations were examined between methylation status and clinicopathlogical features, including tumour MSI status, BRAF V600E mutation, and patient survival. In Ontario,Methylation of
