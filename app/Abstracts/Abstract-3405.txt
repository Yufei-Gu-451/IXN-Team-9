Heparanase is an endoglycosidase that specifically cleaves heparan sulphate side chains of heparan sulphate proteoglycans, activity that is strongly implicated in cell migration and invasion associated with tumour metastasis, angiogenesis and inflammation. Heparanase up-regulation was documented in an increasing number of human carcinomas, correlating with reduced post-operative survival rate and enhanced tumour angiogenesis. Expression and significance of heparanase in human sarcomas has not been so far reported. Here, we applied the Ewing's sarcoma cell line TC71 and demonstrated a potent inhibition of cell invasion
