Determine the stability of tibial and femoral components of 20 cementless knee arthroplasties with rotating platform. The 20 patients (20 knees) underwent an analysis of dynamic radiographs with an image amplifier and maneuvers of varus and valgus which were compared to static frontal and lateral radiographs of the knees and analyzed by two experienced surgeons in a double-blind way. We could observe in this study that both methods showed very similar results for the stability of the tibial and femoral components (p less than 0.001) using the Kappa method for comparison. The tibial component was more unstable in relation to the femoral component in both static and dynamic studies.
