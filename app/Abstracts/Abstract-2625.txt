Cellular transformation is associated with altered glutamine (Gln) metabolism. Tumor cells utilize Gln in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle to maintain sufficient pools of biosynthetic precursors to support rapid growth and proliferation. However, Gln metabolism also generates NADPH, and Gln-derived glutamate is used for synthesis of glutathione (GSH). Since both NADPH and GSH are antioxidants, Gln may also contribute to redox balance in transformed cells. The Hace1 E3 ligase is a tumor suppressor inactivated in diverse human cancers. Hace1 targets the Rac1 GTPase for degradation at Rac1-dependent NADPH oxidase complexes, blocking superoxide generation by the latter. Consequently, loss of Hace1 increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels
