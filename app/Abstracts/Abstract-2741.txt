The accurate diagnosis of adult pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma necessitates a multidisciplinary approach that includes clinical history, biochemical testing, and multimodality imaging such as computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and nuclear medicine studies. This review illustrates the different imaging characteristics of primary adult pheochromocytomas as well as both sympathetic and parasympathetic paragangliomas. The review also describes known genetic associations and shows common metastatic patterns. Knowledge of the diverse appearance of pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas can result in early initial diagnosis or detection of disease recurrence thereby affecting patient management and prognosis.
