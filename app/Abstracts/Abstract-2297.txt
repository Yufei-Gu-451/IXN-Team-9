We examined the association between breastfeeding and visceral adiposity postmenopause. Participants were community-dwelling women aged 55-80 from the Caucasian Rancho Bernardo Study, the Filipino Women's Health Study, and the Health Assessment Study of African-American Women who had visceral adipose tissue (VAT) measurements by computed tomography between 2000-2002. Linear regression was used to determine the association between average breastfeeding duration per child and VAT. In Caucasian, Filipino and African-American women, average number of live births was 3, 4 and 3; average breastfeeding duration was 4.3, 1.8 and 5.1 months, respectively. Filipino women had more live births, were more likely to breastfeed, and breastfed shorter durations. African-American women had lower VAT, despite higher subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), BMI and waist girth. Women who breastfed greater than 3 months on average had 8.8 cmResults suggest breastfeeding initiation is associated with reduced BMI and smaller waist girth and breastfeeding greater than 3 month is associated with lower VAT postmenopause.
