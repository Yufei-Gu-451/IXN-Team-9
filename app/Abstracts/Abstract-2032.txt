We aimed to study key signalling proteins involved in angiogenesis and proliferation on the response to inhibitors of tyrosine kinases and mammalian target of rapamycin in first- and in second-line treatment of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). In a panel of human RCC tumours,We demonstrated that, as single agents, sunitinib, sorafenib and everolimus share similar activity in inhibiting cell proliferation, signal transduction and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion in different RCC models, bothWe demonstrated that a panel of angiogenic and signalling proteins can correlate with the onset of resistance to sunitinib and the activity of everolimus in second line.
