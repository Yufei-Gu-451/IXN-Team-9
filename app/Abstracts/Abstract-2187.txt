This study examined the osteoinductive activity of demineralized human dentin matrix for nude mice. Twenty healthy nude mice weighing about 15 to 20 g were used for study. Demineralized human dentin matrix was prepared and implanted into the dorsal portion of nude mice (subcutaneous), which were sacrificed at two, four, and eight weeks after demineralized dentin matrix grafting and evaluated histologically by H E and Masson trichrome staining. The specimens were also evaluated histomorphometrically. The demineralized dentin matrix induced bone and cartilage formation independently in soft tissues. Histological examination showed bone-forming cells such as osteoblasts and fibroblasts at two, four, and eight weeks. These results suggest that demineralized human dentin matrix has osteoinductive ability, and is a good alternative to autogenous bone graft materials.
