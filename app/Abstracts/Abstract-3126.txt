Obesity causes dramatic proinflammatory changes in the adipose tissue immune environment, but relatively little is known regarding how this inflammation responds to weight loss (WL). To understand the mechanisms by which meta-inflammation resolves during WL, we examined adipose tissue leukocytes in mice after withdrawal of a high-fat diet. After 8 weeks of WL, mice achieved similar weights and glucose tolerance values as age-matched lean controls but showed abnormal insulin tolerance. Despite fat mass normalization, total and CD11c
