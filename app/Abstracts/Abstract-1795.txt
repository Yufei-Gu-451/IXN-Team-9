Precise regulation of beta-cell function is crucial for maintaining blood glucose homeostasis. Pax6 is an essential regulator of beta-cell-specific factors like insulin and Glut2. Studies in the developing eye suggest that Pax6 interacts with Mitf to regulate pigment cell differentiation. Here, we show that Mitf, like Pax6, is expressed in all pancreatic endocrine cells during mouse postnatal development and in the adult islet. A
