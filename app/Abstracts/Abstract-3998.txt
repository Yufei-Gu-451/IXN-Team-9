The diagnosis of chronic radiation enteritis (CRE) is considerably challenging both for clinicians and radiologists. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) in the diagnosis of CRE. To the best of our knowledge, there are no reports on the role of MRE in the diagnosis of CRE specifically. In this report, we present MRE findings of 4 patients with CRE. The most important factors in CRE diagnosis are the clinical findings and medical history, but focal abnormal bowel loop in the region of a known radiation field is the most important information. This abnormal loop is generally located in the distal ileum as present in our patients. Other associated findings helpful for the diagnosis are small bowel thickening, contrast material enhancement in a long segment, mesenteric stranding and luminal narrowing. MRE can be sufficient and useful in the diagnosis of CRE and for treatment planning, especially in patients with significant comorbidities who have had radiotherapy in the past. Adding MRE into the diagnostic algorithm can be helpful in post-radiotherapy patients with acute/subacute gastrointestinal symptoms.
