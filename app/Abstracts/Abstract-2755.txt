The purpose of this article is to illustrate the imaging findings of lesions that present as cyst with a mural nodule tumor (CMNT). CMNT is a subtype pattern of intra-axial enhancement in central nervous system tumors, typical of a variety of brain neoplasms, including, as the most common, hemangioblastoma, pilocytic astrocytoma, ganglioglioma and pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma and as less common tanycytic ependymoma, intraparenchymal schwannoma, desmoplastic infantile ganglioglioma and cystic metastasis. A retrospective design was chosen given the rarity of CMNT. Relevant cases were obtained retrospectively to review the different lesions that can present with the appearance of CMNT.
