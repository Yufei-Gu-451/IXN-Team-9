While recent data have supported the capacity for a neonatal heart to undergo cardiomyogenesis, it is unclear whether these new cardiomyocytes arise from an immature cardiomyoblast population or from the division of mature cardiomyocytes. By following the expression of enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (eGFP) in an Nkx2.5 enhancer-eGFP transgenic mice, we have identified a population of immature cells that can undergo cardiomyogenic as well as smooth muscle cell differentiation in the neonatal heart. Here, we examined growth factors and small molecule regulators that potentially regulate the proliferation and cardiomyogenic
