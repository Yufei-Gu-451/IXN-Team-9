Recent studies suggest CD133, a surface protein widely used for isolation of colon cancer stem cells, to be associated with tumor angiogenesis and recurrence. We hypothesized that gene expression levels and germline variations in CD133 will predict clinical outcome in patients with mCRC, treated in first-line setting with 5-FU, oxaliplatin and bevacizumab and we investigated whether there is a correlation with gene expression levels of CD133, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors.
