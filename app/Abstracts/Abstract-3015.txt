Macrophages play a critical role in inflammation and antigen-presentation. Abnormal macrophage function has been attributed in autoimmune diseases and cancer progression. Recent evidence suggests that high salt tissue micro-environment causes changes in macrophage activation. In our current report, we studied the role of extracellular sodium chloride on phenotype changes in peripheral circulating monocyte/macrophages collected from healthy donors. High salt (0.2 M NaCl vs basal 0.1 M NaCl) treatment resulted in a decrease in MPhi1 macrophage phenotype (CD11bHigh salt induced macrophage switch from MPhi1 to MPhi2-like phenotype. High salt induced anti-inflammatory MPhi2-specific cytokine profile. Reduced phagocytic efficiency upon high salt treatment. Inhibition of iNOS activity following high salt stimulation.
