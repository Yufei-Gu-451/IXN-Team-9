Diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy are two important microvascular diabetes complications with a high concordance rate in diabetic patients. A recent genome-wide association study in type 1 diabetic patients of European descent identified four loci to be associated with diabetic nephropathy. The aim of this study was to test the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from these four loci on diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy in Chinese type 2 diabetic patients. In stage 1, we recruited 1,276 type 2 diabetic patients, including 378 patients with diabetic nephropathy but no retinopathy, 374 patients with diabetic retinopathy but no nephropathy, 244 patients with both diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy, and 280 control subjects with diabetes for greater than 10 years and no diabetic retinopathy or nephropathy. Fifty-five SNPs from four loci (SNPs fromIn this study, we found
