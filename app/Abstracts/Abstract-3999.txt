Solid pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas (SPTP) is a rare pancreatic tumor. Rarely does the tumor have a multicentric location. We report this unusual case of a 24-year-old woman who had 2 large synchronous SPTPs detected incidentally by routine physical examination. There was a 4.0*5.0 cm mass in the pancreatic head and a 7.0*8.0 cm mass in the pancreatic tail. To the best of our knowledge, 3 cases of multicentric SPTP have been reported, but none have been described in the radiology literature. We report a case and describe the CT imaging features of multicentric SPTP with a review of the literature.
