Hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, and increased glucose variability have each been shown to be independently associated with increased risk of mortality in the critically ill. Sechterberger and colleagues have completed a large observational cohort study that demonstrates that diabetic status modulates these relationships in clinically meaningful ways. These findings corroborate, in a strikingly consistent manner, those of another very recently published large observational study.
