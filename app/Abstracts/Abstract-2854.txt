Accumulating evidence indicates that dysregulated microRNA-146a (miR-146a) is involved in tumour genesis and cancer progression. We aimed to evaluate its expression level and the potential for the diagnosis and prognosis in oesophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC). We examined miR-146a expression in 62 pairs of ESCC cancerous and matched paracancerous tissue, 115 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples and serum samples from 154 ESCC patients and 154 healthy volunteers using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR). Kaplan-Meier method, Cox regression and receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were applied to analyse its prognostic and diagnostic value. MicroRNA-146a expression level was significantly decreased in ESCC tissue compared with paracancerous tissue (MicroRNA-146a is significantly reduced in cancerous tissue and serum samples of ESCC patients. It is an ideal biomarker for the prognosis and diagnosis of ESCC.
