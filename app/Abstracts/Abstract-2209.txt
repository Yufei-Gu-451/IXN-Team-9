Although there have been several studies of reduced airway space after mandibular setback surgery using the sagittal split ramus osteotomy technique, research on the risk factors for changes of the airway space is lacking. Therefore, this study was performed to examine airway changes and the position of the hyoid bone after orthognathic surgery, and to assess possible risk factors. In this retrospective study, 50 patients who underwent posterior displacement of the mandible by the bilateral sagittal split ramus osteotomy technique were included. Changes of the position of the hyoid bone and the airway space were analyzed over various follow-up periods, using cephalometric radiography taken preoperatively, immediately after surgery, eight weeks after surgery, six months after surgery, and one year after surgery. To identify risk factors, multiple regression analysis of age, gender, body mass index (BMI), posterior mandibular movement, and the presence of genioplasty was performed. Inferor and posterior movement of the hyoid bone was observed postoperatively, but subsequent observations showed regression towards the anterosuperior aspect. The airway space also significantly decreased after surgery (The amount of mandibular set back was significantly associated with postoperative reduction of airway space. It is necessary to establish a treatment plan considering this factor.
