Limited data exist regarding the effect of the growth process on anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury risk in male versus female children. The proportion of ACL injuries/sports injuries presenting to clinic will vary by age, sex, and body mass index (BMI). Cross-sectional epidemiologic study.Level 3. The study group consisted of a randomly selected 5% probability sample of all children 5 to 17 years of age presenting to a sports medicine clinic from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2009; 2133 charts were reviewed. Data collected included demographics, height and weight, injury mechanism, diagnosis, treatment, previous injury, and organized sports. A total of 206 ACL tears were analyzed (104 girls, 102 boys). Girls were slightly older than boys (15.1 +/- 1.7 vs 14.3 +/- 2.1 years;The proportion of ACL injuries/total injuries was similar for boys and girls aged 13 to 17 years. Girls showed a significantly steeper increase in ACL injury proportion versus boys through puberty. This study will increase clinician awareness of ACL injury occurrence in young male and female athletes 5 to 12 years of age. Injury prevention efforts should target young girls before the onset of puberty and before injury occurs.
