The hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/Met signalling pathway is up-regulated in many cancers, with downstream mediators playing a role in DNA double strand break repair. Previous studies have shown increased radiosensitization of tumours through modulation of Met signalling by genetic methods. We investigated the effects of the anti-HGF monoclonal antibody, AMG102, on the response to ionizing radiation in a model of glioblastoma multiforme
