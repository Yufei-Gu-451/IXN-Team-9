During normal translation, binding of a release factor to one of the three stop codons (UGA, UAA or UAG) results in termination of protein synthesis. However, modification of the initial uridine to a pseudouridine (Psi) allows efficient recognition and read-through of these stop codons by a transfer RNA (tRNA), although it requires formation of two normally forbidden purine-purine base pairs
