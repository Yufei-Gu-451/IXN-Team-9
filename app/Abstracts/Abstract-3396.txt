Overweight in youth is associated with the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. We hypothesized that beta-cell function relative to insulin sensitivity decreases with increasing 2-h glucose levels based on an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in overweight youth. A total of 147 overweight (BMI =85th percentile for age and sex) youth, aged 8 to 20 years, undertook three tests:These data in overweight youth demonstrate that impairment in insulin secretion relative to insulin sensitivity is apparent even with normal glucose tolerance. Below the current cutoff of 140 mg/dL for impaired glucose tolerance, there is a greater than 30% decline in beta-cell function relative to insulin sensitivity. Against this back drop of metabolically heightened risk for type 2 diabetes, preventive measures should target the beta-cell alongside insulin sensitization.
