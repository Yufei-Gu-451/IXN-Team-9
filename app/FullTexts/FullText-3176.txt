Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) also known as Forestier disease is a noninflammatory condition predominantly affecting the spine. The condition was first described in 1950, but as of date, the exact cause remains unknown. NoneDiffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis causes calcification and ossification of the anterolateral spinal column and spinal ligaments (anterior longitudinal ligament). NoneThe prevalence of this condition varies by population but appears to increase with age. NoneNone-NoneStudies have also indicated that the disease is common and more severe in men than in women. NoneThe prevalence of DISH ranges from a low of 3.9% among African blacksNoneto nearly 50% in Pima Indian males older than 44 years. NoneThe diagnosis of DISH is obtained via axial radiographic findings according to the Resnick criteria, whereas the newer criteria of Utsinger include the peripheral manifestations of the condition. None,NoneAlthough the relatively newer criteria has lowered the threshold needed to diagnose the condition, it is still frequently diagnosed at a fully developed or late stage. None,NoneThe ankylosis of a vertebral segment causes spinal stiffness and can contribute to a baseline level of pain. This chronic pain can often mask the onset of spinal fracture/instability, causing a delay in diagnosis. None,NoneDiffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis can predispose to spinal fractures from low-energy mechanisms. None,NoneLow-energy trauma is a common method of injury to the fastest growing population (geriatric) in the United States, and this population also have a greater tendency for upper cervical spine fractures. NoneOdontoid fractures comprise 9% to 15% of all cervical spine fractures and are the most common spinal fracture in patients older than 70 years of age. NoneNone-NoneOdontoid fractures are classified as type 1, 2, or 3, depending on the location of the fracture. Type 2, fracture at the base of the odontoid, is the most common type of odontoid fractures. We report a case of a type 2 odontoid fracture in a patient with DISH successfully managed nonoperatively with a long-term follow-up. A 73-year-old male presented to the emergency department after sustaining a ground-level fall due to a syncopal episode. He was experiencing some neck pain. He had no weakness in the upper or lower extremities. He had no numbness and was ambulating with no difficulty. Per the emergency department protocol, a computed tomography (CT) scan of the head and cervical spine was performed. Cervical spine CT demonstrated DISH from C2 to T2 and a minimally displaced type 2 odontoid fracture (Figure 1). There was initial concern whether the fracture is acute or chronic. However, since he was having pain and was neurologically intact, he was offered nonoperative management consisting of a hard cervical collar. At 2-year follow-up, the patient was experiencing mild neck pain. Radiographs and CT of the cervical spine demonstrated a stable fracture nonunion of the odontoid fracture (Figure 2). After discussing nonoperative versus operative options, the patient and treatment team elected to continue with nonoperative management. Sagittal computed tomography (CT) of the cervical demonstrating the odontoid fracture in the setting of diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH). Lateral, flexion, extension radiograph at 2-year follow-up demonstrating a stable nonunion. Radiographs and CT of the cervical spine demonstrated a stable fracture nonunion of the odontoid fracture (Figures 2and3). Sagittal computed tomography (CT) of the cervical spine performed at 2-year follow-up demonstrating the nonunion at the fracture site with minimal displacement. Odontoid fractures are common injuries in the geriatric population. NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNone-NoneOdontoid fractures with minimal displacement can be treated nonoperatively with immobilization. In the setting of severe displacement or neurological changes, there's a role for operative management. Fractures of the cervical spine in the setting of hyperostosis (DISH, ankylosing spondylitis) are often encountered in the subaxial spine, usually at C6-C7.2 Hyperostotic spine fractures often result in 3-column injuries that render the spine unstable and often benefit from surgical intervention. Odontoid fractures in the setting of DISH are rare. Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis and ankylosing spondylitis of the cervical spine lead to a long lever arm similar to a long bone. This predisposes to unstable fractures often with displacement in extension. In our patient, C2 was the proximal extent of his DISH, and he did not sustain a neurological injury due to the minimal displacement of the fracture. He also did not have a 3-column injury or instability that required acute surgical intervention. Nonunions can develop following nonoperative management of odontoid fractures in up to 88% of geriatric odontoid fracture. NoneNoneNone-NoneHowever, the effect of radiographic nonunion on clinical outcome is debatable and does not appear to correlate with patient-reported outcomes. NoneNone-NoneIn patients who fail nonoperative management, there is a role for surgical intervention, with C1-C2 posterior arthrodesis being the most effective. NoneIn a series of geriatric odontoid nonunions, 16 patients undergoing C1-C2 arthrodesis were compared to 28 patients undergoing nonoperative management at 5-year follow-up, and there was no difference in clinical outcomes. NoneSeveral series have reported on the management of hyperostotic spine fractures (DISH and ankylosing spondylitis). None,None,NoneNoneNone-NoneTo our knowledge, we are reporting the first successful nonoperative management of an odontoid fracture in the setting of DISH. Paley et al, in their series of 6 DISH patients with spine fractures, report on 1 patient with an odontoid fracture who was initially managed nonoperatively and 2 years following injury developed myelopathy at the fracture site. NoneHe was successfully managed with C1-C2 arthrodesis and halo immobilization. Whang et al, in their series of 18 DISH patients with spine fractures, had 1 patient with a C2 fracture (unclear whether it was an odontoid fracture). The patient had a complete spinal cord injury and was managed with halo immobilization and subsequently died. NoneLastly, Tsuji et al reported on a 73-year-old male with DISH and undiagnosed odontoid fracture that resulted in torticollis. The patient underwent surgical correction of the deformity and occipitocervical fusion. NoneIn conclusion, we report the first, to our knowledge, successful nonoperative management of an odontoid fracture in the setting of DISH. Inherently, fractures in the setting of DISH or ankylosing spondylitis are highly unstable, and it is seldom that nonoperative management succeeds. However, in the setting of nondisplaced odontoid fracture without neurological deficits, a trial of nonoperative can be attempted and possibly succeeded as demonstrated in our case.
