High proliferative and invasive behavior of malignant tumors of the central nervous system is responsible for inefficacy of existing treatment procedures (1). Glioma malignancy is, in part, attributed to the action of a group of metallo-, cysteine and serine proteases, which degrade extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins (2,3). Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) is a 72 kDa, Zn+2-dependent secreted endopeptidase and its elevated expression is highly correlated with increased tumor progression implicating its multiple roles in tumor cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and angiogenesis (4). Enhanced glioma malignancy is also characterized by aberrant expression of integrins, which comprises 18 alpha and 8 beta subunits that combine to form about 24 heterodimers, and their dynamic interactions with ECM molecules generate intracellular oncogenic signaling events (5). Several studies demonstrated the significance of MMP-2/alphaVbeta3 integrin liaison in the regulation of tumor proliferation, invasion, and angiogenesis (6-9). Along with alphaVbeta3, integrin alpha5beta1 (Very Late Antigen 5, VLA5) is also implicated to enhance tumor progression by triggering various survival signaling pathways including PI3K-AKT, Bcl-2, and NF-kappaB (10-14). Recently accumulating evidences shows alpha5beta1-mediated modulation of MMP-2 activity and suggests a direct interaction between MMP-2 and alpha5 integrin in melanoma and breast cancer cells (15-17). Migrating astrocytes show co-localization of MMP-2 with beta1 integrin at the cell periphery, indicating its significance in pericellular proteolysis (18). However, knowledge on MMP-2/alpha5beta1 interaction and its role in the regulation of alpha5beta1-mediated signaling pathways in glioma is still lacking. Tumor progression is orchestrated by an intricate set of cytokines which play key roles in attenuation of apoptosis and enhanced invasion and metastases of cancer tissue (8,19). Interleukin-6 (IL-6) belongs to a family of cytokines participating in gp130 receptor signaling in the activation of JAK/Stat3 activation in several cancers including glioblastoma and high circulating IL-6 levels are associated with increased tumor malignancy (20-24). Upon stimulation, IL-6 binds to sIL-6R, which then induces gp130 dimerization and Janus kinases (JAKs) phosphorylation which facilitate recruitment, phosphorylation, and subsequent nuclear translocation of STAT (Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription) proteins (25) Persistent Stat3 activation is a hallmark of several human cancers, and it acts as a critical transcriptional mediator of oncogenic signaling, enhancing cancer cell proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis via activation of its target genes, which encode anti-apoptotic and angiogenic factors (26-30). High Stat3 activity is correlated with enhanced MMP-2 activity, which is itself a Stat3 target gene and blockade of Stat3 activity by dominant-negative-Stat3 or treatment with JAK-inhibitor significantly reduced MMP activity (31-33). Specific inhibition of the of Stat3 signaling cascade inhibited invasion and migration in glioma and tumor growth in lung cancer (22,34,35). Our previous studies with MMP-2 knockdown in human lung cancer and glioma cell lines inhibited proliferation, invasion, and migration and led to apoptotic cell death (36) Based on the complexity of integrin signaling and our preliminary cytokine expression analysis of the culture supernatants (which revealed a significant suppression of several cytokines under MMP-2 depleted conditions), we sought to determine the possible modulation of beta1 integrin-mediated IL-6/Stat3 activation and its implication in MMP-2.siRNA-induced cell death in human glioma xenograft cell lines. Taken together, the detailed analysis of constitutive Stat3 inhibition with MMP-2.siRNA and alpha5beta1 blocking treatments confirmed the substantial interaction of MMP-2/alpha5beta1 integrin by immunocomplex formation and further elucidates the mechanistic role of MMP-2/alpha5beta1 in IL-6/Stat3 signaling activation in glioma. The significant inhibition in MMP-2 expression and activity in pM-treated 4910 and 5310 cells in comparison to mock- and pSV- treated cells at 48 h was confirmed by RT-PCR, Western blotting and gelatin zymography (Supplementary Figure S1A). BrDU proliferation assay at pre-determined time intervals indicated that the pM-transfected cells showed a time-dependent decrease in proliferation rate from 24 to 96 hours compared to mock and pSV-treated cells. A significant inhibition in proliferation up to 56.5% (72 hours) and 66.1% (96 hours) was documented in pM-treated 4910 cells. The 5310 cells displayed 56.2% and 65.4% decrease in BrDU incorporation at 72 and 96 hours of post-transfection, respectively (Figure 1A). Immunofluorescence showed decreased nuclear Ki-67 staining in pM-treated cells compared to mock- and pSV-treated controls (Figure 1B). Further, monolayer colony formation assay showed severe hindrance in the colony forming efficiency of pM-treated cells (Figure 1C). After 10 days, there was up to greater than =70.8% and greater than =71.2% inhibition in colony formation in pM-treated 4910 and 5310 cells respectively when compared to their control counterparts (Figure 1D). A possible interaction between MMP-2 and alpha5beta1 has been implicated in the modulation of MMP-2 activity and subsequent tumor cell invasion has been reported previously in melanoma and breast cancer cells (15-17). Several reports suggested the positive regulation of survival signaling by alpha5beta1 integrin and targeting by alpha5beta1 antagonists decreased proliferation in tumor cells (37,38). Based on the previous reports suggesting possible MMP-2/alpha5beta1 integrin interaction and with the prominent proliferation inhibition upon MMP-2 downregulation in our studies we next checked the effect of MMP-2 knockdown on alpha5 and beta1 integrin expression levels. Both alpha5 and beta1 mRNA and protein expression levels were remarkably reduced and densitometric analysis showed up to ~60% reduction in pM-treated 4910 and 5310 cells compared to control counterparts (Supplementary Fig. S1B,Figure 2A). Immunoprecipitation experiments showed immunocomplex formation of MMP-2/alpha5 and MMP-2/beta1 by physical interaction in un-treated 4910 and 5310 cells whereas pM-treated cells show decreased interaction (Figure 2B). Eventually co-IP blots were re-probed with antibody used for immunoprecipitation to check the band specificity, input samples were subjected to Western blotting, and GAPDH levels were estimated to confirm equal loading. Confocal studies signified a strong co-localization of MMP-2 with alpha5beta1 in mock- and pSV-treated 4910 and 5310 cells. On the other hand, pM-transfected cells showed noticeable inhibition in MMP-2 and alpha5beta1 expression, which subsequently led to decreased MMP-2/alpha5beta1 co-localization. Densitometric analysis showed significant reduction (up to ~67%) in MMP-2/alpha5beta1 co-localization upon pM-treatment for 48 hours (Figure 2C). To further verify the MMP-2/alpha5beta1 interaction, we overexpressed siRNA-insensitive Myc-tagged MMP-2 (pM-FL-A141G) in 4910 and 5310 cells. MMP-2 overexpression was confirmed by Western blotting analysis in comparison to mock or pEV controls (Supplementary Fig. S1C). Immunoprecipitation and probing with anti-MMP-2 and anti-Myc antibodies confirmed enhanced MMP-2/alpha5beta1 binding in pM-FL-A141G treated cells compared to mock and pEV control counterparts (Supplementary Fig. S1C). siRNA-insensitive MMP-2 overexpression upon pM-FL-A141G treatment was confirmed by Western blotting (Supplementary Fig. S1D). The prominent decreases in MMP-2 and alpha5beta1 expression levels and interaction in pM treatments and enhancement of MMP-2/alpha5beta1 binding by pM-FL-A141G treatment suggests a role of MMP-2 binding in alpha5beta1 integrin-mediated intracellular signaling. The high expression and co-localization of MMP-2 and alpha5beta1 integrin was also evident in the human glioblastoma tissues implicating the significance of MMP-2/alpha5beta1 binding in glioma malignancy where as normal brain tissues did not show noticeable expression and MMP-2/alpha5beta1 co-localization (Supplementary Figure S2). The tumor microenvironment is characterized by enhanced cytokine levels, which in turn activates signaling pathways facilitating exacerbation of proliferation, differentiation, and invasion of the tumor cells (19). With the prominent reduction of proliferation in MMP-2 knockdown cells, we next sought to evaluate the secretory cytokine profile in the extracellular milieu. As described in Materials and Methods, conditioned media consisting of secretory cytokines and growth factors was collected from pSV- and pM-treated cells and subjected to cytokine array which indicated a prominent modulation in cytokine release pattern with an inhibition in several cytokines including GM-CSF, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-alpha, Angiogenin, VEGF, and PDGF-BB in MMP-2-knockdown cells. Densitometric analysis of cytokine array showed significant (p less than 0.01) and moderate (p less than 0.05) differences among pSV and pM treatments. Upon pM-treatment a significant inhibition in GM-CSF, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, VEGF, and PDGF-BB (atp less than 0.01) and a moderate decrease in TNF-alpha (p less than 0.05) was documented in both 4910 and 5310 cells (Figure 3A). Angiogenin showed a noticeable inhibition of up to ~71% in 4910 and a moderate loss up to ~48% in 5310 cells, respectively. This noticeable reduction in the secretion levels of GM-CSF, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-alpha, Angiogenin, VEGF, PDGF BB was further confirmed by subjecting conditioned media to Western blot analysis in both 4910 and 5310 cell lines (Figure 3B). The significant loss of cytokine secretion is in correlation with the reduction of cellular expression levels of cytokines IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 in MMP-2 knockdown 4910 and 5310 cells (Figure 3C). Interleukin-6 is one of the abundantly expressed cytokine in the tumor microenvironment, which binds to gp130 receptor and subsequently activates JAK/STAT survival signaling. Based on the striking downregulation of cellular and secreted IL-6 levels in pM-treated cells, we further checked the possible modulation Stat3 signaling pathway genes by performing JAK/STAT pathway PCR array and compared gene expression profiles in pSV- and pM- treated cells. The significant fold change deviation from threshold value were indicated which included the genes encoding JAK receptor proteins, other interacting proteins, and Stat3-target proteins. Among the various downregulated Stat3 signaling related genes, the essential receptor proteins such as EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor); IL-6ST (gp130); IL2RG (Interleukin 2 receptor, gamma); IL1-RA (Interleukin 10 receptor, alpha); IL-4R (Interleukin 4 receptor); Tyk2 (Tyrosine kinase 2); JAK2 (Janus kinase 2) and Csf2rb (Colony stimulating factor 2 receptor, beta), showed decreased expression implying a modulation of expression of several receptor proteins in the pM treatment group of both cell lines (Table 1). The PCR array analysis also revealed a noticeable downregulation in Stat3 target genes encoding for c-Myc, Bcl-2L1, CyclinD1 and upregulation in Stat3 signaling suppressors including PIAS1, SOCS1, CDKI1A and PP2Aalpha confirming the potential negative regulation of Stat3 pathway in MMP-2 depleted cells. Western blotting showed considerable decrease in gp130, phospho-JAK1, JAK1, phospho-JAK2, JAK2 and phospho-Stat3 (Tyr-705 and Ser-727) expression levels with no noticeable change in total Stat3 in pM-treated 4910 and 5310 cells whereas constitutive Stat3 activation were documented in both mock- and pSV-treated controls (Figure 4A). Even though the inhibition in Stat3 phosphorylation was evident at 24 h we observed further decrease at 48 hours post pM-transfection indicating that this effect was time-dependent (data not shown). Fluorescence microscopy showed conspicuous reduction in phospho-Stat3 expression and subsequent nuclear translocation in MMP-2 knockdown cells. In contrast, mock- and pSV-treated cells show high expression of phospho-Stat3 distributed throughout cytoplasm, with prominent nuclear localization (Figure 4B). To further assess the effect of pM on Stat3 DNA-binding activity, EMSA was performed which revealed a high Stat3 activity in both mock- and pSV-treated 4910 and 5310 controls. Conversely, a prominent decrease in DNA-binding activity was evidenced in 48 h pM-transfected cells implying that the loss of MMP-2 leads to suppression of constitutive STAT3 activation (Figure 4C). Further, the recruitment of Stat3 was assessed by ChIP assay which showed a strong occupancy of Stat3 at CyclinD1 and c-Myc promoters in both mock- and pSV-treated 4910 and 5310 cells. In contrast, MMP-2 suppression using pM noticeably inhibited the Stat3 recruitment on to CyclinD1 and c-Myc promoters suggesting the downregulation of these proteins (Figure 4D). Western blotting showed a remarkable downregulation in Stat3 target proteins CyclinD1, c-Myc, Bcl-xL, Bcl2 and Survivin in pM-treated 4910 and 5310 cells in comparison to control counterparts (Figure 4E). Eventually, to rule out the off-target effects of pM on negative regulation of alpha5beta1-mediated IL-6/Stat3 activation and proliferation in 4910 and 5310 cell lines, parallel MMP-2 knockdown experiments were also performed using pM-1 (siRNA in pcDNA3.0 targeting the 1073-1094 position in MMP-2 cDNA), pM-2 (sc-29398) and siRNA-specific scrambled vectors pSV-1 and pSV-2. Comparable to pM-induced MMP-2 knockdown, pM-1 and pM-2 treatments also resulted in a noticeable decrease in proliferation compared to respective pSV-1 and pSV-2 controls (Supplementary Fig. S3A). The conditioned media from pM-1 and pM-2 treated cells showed drastic reduction in the secreted levels of IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 in corroboration with the downregulation of cellular expression levels of alpha5 integrin, beta1 integrin, IL-6, phospho-Stat3, (Supplementary Fig. S3B, S3C). The effect of MMP-2 downregulation was also evaluated in another two human glioma cell lines, U251 and U87, which confirmed the noticeable decrease in proliferation and suppression of alpha5, beta1, IL-6, expression and JAK1, JAK2 and Stat3 phosphorylation levels (Supplementary Fig. S4). To further evaluate the significance of MMP-2.siRNA-induced IL-6 inhibition on subsequent JAK/Stat3 pathway attenuation, we overexpressed IL-6 and confirmed the enhanced mRNA and protein expression levels of IL-6 in transfected 4910 and 5310 cells after 24 hours (Supplementary Fig. S5A). There was remarkable elevation of gp130, phopsho-JAK1, JAK1, phospho-JAK2, JAK2 and phospho-Stat3 expression levels in cells treated with pIL-6 alone or pSV+pIL-6 compared to either mock- or pSV-treated cells. In contrast the expression levels of IL-6, phospho-JAK2, and phosho-Stat3 in pM+IL-6 treatments were elevated when compared to pM treatment alone and lesser in comparison to either pIL-6 or pSV+pIL-6 treatments, implying a significant reversal of phospho-Stat3 inhibition by IL-6 overexpression in pM-treated cells. The reversal in gp130, phospho-JAK1, JAK1, phospho-JAK2, JAK2 and phospho-Stat3 expression correlated with IL-6 overexpression in pM-treated cells, further implying that the MMP-2 depletion attenuated the IL-6-mediated Stat3 activation (Figure 5A). Corroborating previous reports showing MMP-2 as a potential Stat3 target gene, IL-6 overexpression in turn resulted in remarkable elevation in MMP-2 gelatinolytic activity, which was suppressed in pM+pIL-6 combination treatment (Supplementary Figure S5B). Additionally, EMSA also showed significant reversal of IL-6-induced Stat3-DNA binding activity in pM+pIL-6 treatment suggesting that the loss of MMP-2 activity inhibited the IL-6 mediated Stat3 activation (Figure 5B). Confocal microscopy also revealed elevation in phospho-Stat3 nuclear localization in pIL-6-treated cells compared to mock-treated cells and pM+pIL-6-treated cells showed an expression pattern similar to either mock or pSV treatment confirming the reversal of pM-inhibited phospho-Stat3 nuclear localization in pIL-6-treated cells (Supplementary Figure S5C). The effect of pM and pM+pIL-6 treatments was further checked on cell proliferation using BrDU assay. IL-6 overexpression restored the pM-inhibited proliferation in pM+pIL-6 treatment (Figure 5C). Additionally, we observed a consistent reversal in pM-induced PARP and caspase-3 cleavage, and inhibition in CyclinD1 and c-Myc expression levels in pM+pIL-6-treated cells, which directly indicates that the loss of MMP-2 leads to the suppression of IL-6/Stat3 proliferation signaling (Figure 5D). To establish specificity of pM-inhibited IL-6/Stat3 activation and to avoid any off-target consequences, we treated mock-, pSV- and pM-treated cells with siRNA-insensitive MMP-2 overexpression plasmid (pM-FL-A141G) or rhMMP-2 as described in Materials and Methods. The expression levels of alpha5, beta1, phospho-Stat3, CyclinD1 and c-Myc were elevated in both pM-FL-A141G and rhMMP-2 treated cells, implicating a possible role of MMP-2 in the regulation of the alpha5beta1-mediated Stat3 activation and cell proliferation (Figure 6A). As shown inFig. 6B, the loss-and-gain of function approach by pM and pM-FL-A141G or rhMMP-2 treatments showed a significantly enhanced MMP-2/alpha5beta1 association by complex formation in rhMMP-2- or pM-FL-A141G-treated cells and decreased association in pM-treated cells. Immunoprecipitation with non-specific (Nsp-IgG) did not show precipitation and re-probing the IP blots with anti-alpha5, anti-beta1 and anti-Myc antibodies further confirmed the band specificity. Densitometric analysis of relative binding confirmed that the pM+rhMMP-2 or pM+pM-FL-A141G combination treatment noticeably counteracted the rhMMP-2- or pM-FL-A141G-elevated MMP-2/alpha5beta1 binding, which further evidences direct substantial MMP-2/alpha5beta1 integrin interaction in both 4910 and 5310 cells. In correlation with MMP-2 overexpression-induced MMP-2/alpha5beta1 binding, EMSA displayed obvious elevation in Stat3 DNA-binding activity in rhMMP-2 treatment which is reduced in pM+rhMMP-2-treated cells confirming the role of MMP-2 in maintaining constitutive Stat3 activity (Figure 6C). A noticeable elevation in Stat3 occupancy on to CylcinD1 and c-Myc promoters was observed in pM-FL-A141G- or rhMMP-2-treated 4910 and 5310 cells. In corroboration with the reversal of MMP-2/alpha5beta1 complex formation in pM+rhMMP-2 and pM+pM-FL-A141G treated cells, a clear reversal in Stat3 promoter recruitment was observed suggesting a role of MMP-2 in alpha5beta1-mediated Stat3 activation and promoter binding (Figure 6D). Additionally, the pM-induced loss of cell proliferation was reversed in pM+rhMMP-2 or pM+pM-FL-A141G treatments whereas individual rhMMP-2 or pM-FL-A141G treatments alone enhanced the proliferation rate in both cell lines indicating the role of MMP-2 in maintenance of tumor cell proliferation (Figure 6E). To further assess the pM-inhibited alpha5beta1 signaling, we elevated the beta1 signaling by FN adhesion in mock-, pSV- and pM-treated cells. Western blotting indicated the alpha5beta1-mediated elevation in phospho-Stat3, CyclinD1 and c-Myc expression levels were decreased in pM-treated cells evidencing the role of MMP-2 in the regulation of alpha5beta1-mediated Stat3 activation (Figure 7A). The essential functional role of MMP-2/alpha5beta1 interaction on rhMMP-2-induced and pM-inhibited activation of IL-6/Stat3 was verified by treating the cells with alpha5beta1 blocking antibody in combination with pM and rhMMP-2 treatments. The effect of alpha5beta1 blocking antibody on pM-inhibited IL-6/Stat3 activation and subsequent cell survival was checked to investigate the role of MMP-2/alpha5beta1 coupling in these tumor cell lines. Blocking of alpha5beta1 integrin further reduced the pM-inhibited recruitment of Stat3 on both CyclinD1 and c-Myc promoters suggesting the functional significance of MMP-2 and alpha5beta1 integrin co-operativity (Figure 7B). Supplementation of alpha5beta1 blocking antibody to rhMMP-2-treated 4910 and 5310 cells substantially decreased the rhMMP-2-induced expression levels of IL-6, phospho-Stat3, CyclinD1 and c-Myc. On the other hand, augmentation of alpha5beta1 blocking antibody to pM-treated cells further decreased the pM-inhibited expression levels of IL-6, phopsho-Stat3, CyclinD1 and c-Myc expression levels implying the significance of MMP-2 binding in alpha5beta1-mediated Stat3 activation and cell survival. The expression levels of Stat3 target proteins CyclinD1 and c-Myc were severely reduced and almost undetectable in pM+anti-alpha5beta1 integrin treatments in both the cell lines when compared to either pM- or anti-alpha5beta1 integrin-treatments indicating that the loss of MMP-2 augments the inhibitory effects of alpha5beta1 blocking antibody (Figure 7C). The combination of pM and alpha5beta1 substantially inhibited the rhMMP-2-induced Stat3 activation and expression of CyclinD1 and c-Myc proteins when compared to either pM or anti-alpha5beta1 treatments alone, which indicates that the disruption of MMP-2 and alpha5beta1 association inhibits IL-6/Stat3 survival signaling leads to decrease in proliferation in 4910 and 5310 glioma xenograft cells. In vivoexperiments showing the effect of pM-treatment on intracranial tumor growth by orthotropic injection of 4910 and 5310 cells showed remarkable decrease in the tumor size when compared to mock- and pSV-treated tumors (Figure 8A). High expression and predominant co-localization MMP-2 and alpha5beta1 integrin at membrane periphery were identified in both mock- and pSV-treated tumors (Figure 8B). In contrast, pM-treated tumors showed substantial decrease in MMP-2 and alpha5beta1 expression, which subsequently led to decreased MMP-2/alpha5beta1 co-localization correlating with reduced IL-6 and phospho-Stat3 expression levels (Figure 8C). Further expression levels of proliferation markers Ki-67 and PCNA were studied to check the number of proliferating cells in sections which revealed the severely inhibition Ki-67 and PCNA positivity in pM-treated tumor sections whereas the mock- and pSV- treated control tumors showed high proliferating cells with intense nuclear Ki-67 and PCNA staining (Supplementary Figure S6). The CyclinD1 and c-Myc expression was significantly decreased in pM-treated tumor sections when compared to pSV-treated control counterparts (Supplementary Figure S7). Thesein vivoobservations corroborate thein vitrofindings confirming the role of MMP-2 in alpha5beta1 mediated IL-6/Stat3 signaling activation in glioma. Apoptotic cell death plays a crucial role in the development of multi-cellular organisms, but it is also a major concern in cancer treatment as cancer is a consequence of aberrant cell proliferation there by manipulation of the extra- and intracellular signals directing intracellular oncogenic signaling activation may serve to drive tumor cells towards cell death (39). MMPs are the extracellular matrix remodeling proteases that act as critical mediators in tumor microenvironment changes (2). Integrins are membrane-spanning proteins, with their extracellular domains bound to the ECM proteins while their cytoplasmic tails facilitate assembly of intracellular proteins and propagate the outside-in signaling. Among other integrins, accumulating evidences indicate the high expression of alpha5beta1 in glioblastoma cells suggesting its potential as a new therapeutic target (37,40). One of the key mechanisms of integrins is their interaction and modulation of MMP activity (16,17). The alpha5beta1 integrin activates NF-kappaB proliferative signaling and elevates the expression of genes involved in angiogenesis and inflammation whereas Chinese hampster ovary (CHO) cells expressing truncated alpha5Deltacbeta1 without the cytoplasmic domain show impaired NF-kappaB activation, leading to cell death (13,41). In a recent report, Shainet al. (42) demonstrated the role of beta1 integrin in IL-6 mediated Stat3 survival signaling in multiple myeloma cells. Studies on the blockade of the IL-6/Stat3 signaling pathway by anti-IL-6 receptor antibody substantially inhibited tumor progression by downregulating Stat3 signaling in human colon carcinoma cells (43). Targeting beta1 integrins with beta1-inhibitory antibody significantly inhibits proliferation by apoptosis in breast cancer cellsin vitroandin vivo(44). A non-RGD-based peptide inhibitor of alpha5beta1 integrin ATN-161 and a functional blocking alpha5beta1 integrin antibody blocksin vivotumor growth and metastasis in breast cancer cells (45). The N-glycosylation of Interaction-like (I-like) domain of beta1 integrin is required for alpha5beta1 heterodimer formation, and the role of alpha5beta1 in tumor cell survival signaling has been elucidated previously (12,13,38,46). On the other hand, the alpha5beta1 integrin functional blocking inhibitory antibody Volociximab significantly reduced tumor growth in mouse and rabbit VX2 carcinoma models (47). Though several studies suggested the effect of various integrins on the manipulation of cytokine levels, the effect of alpha5beta1 integrin heterodimer on IL-6 expression and its downstream signaling is unknown. A functional significance of the MMP-2/beta1 integrin binding was confirmed by immunoprecipitation in the negative regulation of human endothelial cell apoptosis has been reported earlier (48). Association between MMP-2 and alpha5beta1 integrin by direct binding in melanoma and breast cancer cells and co-localization of MMP-2/alpha5beta1 in migrating astrocytes has been indicated previously (16-18). Based on these reports, we sought to determine whether there was any direct interaction of MMP-2/alpha5beta1 integrin by complex formation in glioma. Here, for the first time, we show significant interaction of MMP-2 with alpha5beta1 heterodimer in human glioma xenograft cells bothin vitroandin vivo. However, our co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization studies do not show direct binding between MMP-2 and alpha5beta1 integrin but indicate that they form a complex which may be bridged by unidentified proteins. Recent reports showed the effect of NF-kappaB blockade on inhibition of cancer cell adhesion via downregulation of alpha2, alpha3 and beta1 integrins (49). Previous studies on MMP-2 knockdown showed inhibition of NF-kappaB nuclear localization and DNA-binding activity (50). Our present studies showing pM-inhibited beta1 integrin transcriptional and protein expression suggest a possible indirect role of pM-inhibited NF-kappaB in the downregulation of these integrin molecules. The role of beta1 integrin in enhancing IL-6 mediated Stat3 signaling in multiple myeloma has been previously elucidated (42). Role of IL-6 in JAK/Stat3-mediated MMP-2 activation in pancreatic and glioma cancer cells and MMP-10 activation in lung adenocarcinoma cells has been reported to enhance growth and invasion (32,51,52). Farber,et al. (37) showed that the treatment with alpha5beta1 integrin inhibitor JSM6427 does not have any effect on the cytokine release pattern in microglial cells. However, in our studies with glioma xenograft cell lines, the MMP-2 siRNA-mediated inhibition of alpha5beta1 expression is in correlation with changes in the cytokine release pattern in 4910 and 5310 cells, suggesting the effects of alpha5beta1 inhibition are cell-specific. The significance of IL-6 in tumor progression has been reported (53,54). The specific role of MMP-2 downregulation on inhibition of alpha5, beta1, IL-6 expression and Stat3 phosphorylation were further confirmed by employing 3 different MMP-2.siRNAs and this effect was also checked in U251 and U87 human glioma cell lines. Our studies with alpha5beta1 blocking by functional blocking antibody paralleled with the effect of MMP-2 downregulation inhibiting IL-6 expression and hindered Stat3 phosphorylation and recruitment on to Cyclin D1 and c-Myc promoters indicates high relevance to MMP-2/alpha5beta1 interaction in maintaining IL-6 mediated constitutive Stat3 activation in glioma. The significant inhibition of alpha5beta1-mediated IL-6/Stat3 activation in MMP-2 downregulation was further analyzedin vivowhich indicated significant reduction in IL-6, phospho-Stat3 levels leading to reduced tumor growth. Suppression of IL-6 and IL-8, target genes of NF-kappaB in MMP-2 siRNA treatment in both cell lines, is in parallel with our previous observation of decreased NF-kappaB activation upon MMP-2 downregulation in both 4910 and 5310 cell lines (50). Our observations on alpha5beta1 role in the activation of IL-6 mediated Stat3 signaling activation in glioma xenograft cells also corroborate previous reports on the role of alpha5beta1 integrin adhesion in elevating the IL-6-mediated STAT3 pathway in multiple myeloma cells (42). In summary, our findings on MMP-2.siRNA mediated alpha5beta1 suppression in two human xenograft cell lines 4910 and 5310, imply that role of MMP-2 in the regulation alpha5beta1 mediated cellular signaling. The study provides further insights in to the co-operativity between MMP-2 and alpha5beta1 integrin by indirect physical interaction in the maintenance of constitutive IL-6 mediated Stat3 DNA-binding activity and expression of subsequent downstream effector genes suggesting MMP-2 suppression as a potential therapeutic approach in glioma treatment. Human glioma xenograft cell lines 4910 and 5310 (kindly provided by Dr. David James, University of California, San Francisco) are highly invasive in mouse brain were developed and maintained in mice (55). These cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Mediatech Inc., Herndon, VA) medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA), 50 units/mL penicillin, and 50 ug/mL streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc., Frederick, MD) by incubation in a humidified 5% CO2chamber at 37 degrees C. Human glioma cell lines U251 and U87 (American Type Culture Collection) were grown in RPMI medium 1640 containing glutamate (5mM) and 5% FBS and maintained in CO2incubator. We used antibodies against MMP-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, alpha5-integrin, beta1-integrin, phospho-JAK1 (Tyr1022), phospho-JAK2 (Tyr1007/1008), gp130, Stat3 (sc-482 X; Gel supershift ChIP grade), phopsho-Stat3 (Tyr705), phospho-Stat3 (Ser727), c-Myc, CyclinD1, Bcl-x(L), Bcl-2, Survivin, Ki-67, PCNA, GAPDH, and HRP/Alexa Fluor(r) conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), caspase-3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (Cell Signal Technology). Anti-integrin alpha5beta1, clone HA5 (MAB1999), and alpha5beta1 functional blocking antibody (MAB1969) (Millipore Inc., Billerica, MA) were obtained. Human Brain Tumor Tissue Microarray, GL2082 (US Biomax, Inc, Rockville, MD), IL-6 overexpression (pIL-6) plasmid (Origene technologies, Rockville, MD) and human recombinant-MMP-2 protein (rhMMP-2) were also purchased for this study (EMD Biosciences, San Diego, CA). Transient transfection studies were performed as described previously by Kesanakurtiet al. (50). In brief, cells were transfected with pcDNA3.0 containing MMP-2.siRNA sequence (pM, targets 131-152 nucleotides of MMP-2 cDNA) and specific scrambled siRNA sequence (pSV) cloned as described previously (50) using FuGene HD transfection reagent following manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN). The effect of MMP-2 downregulation was also checked by transient transfection studies using MMP-2.siRNA-1 (pM-1 [caaatatgagagctgcaccag], pcDNA3.0 vector containing siRNA targeting 1073-1094 nucleotides in MMP-2 cDNA) and MMP-2.siRNA-2 (pM-2 [pool of siRNAs targeting different regions of MMP-2, sc-29398], purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) in comparison to specific scrambled vectors pSV-1 and pSV-2. Full-length cDNA of MMP-2 was RT-PCR amplified using sequence specific primers and cloned inEcoRI andXbaI sites of pcDNA3.1(+)/myc-His-A (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA) to construct overexpression plasmid (pM-FL). A silent mutation was introduced within the siRNA-targeted MMP-2 cDNA sequence (nucleotides 131-152, 5'-AACGGACAAAGAGTTGGCAGT-3') without changing the aminoacid sequence (nucleotides 131-152, 5'-AACGGACAAGGAGTTGGCAGT-3') by using pM-FL as a template and QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) following manufacturer's instructions. This siRNA-insensitive plasmid with A141G mutation was verified by DNA sequencing and is designated as pM-FL-A141G. For combination treatments, at 24 h post-transfection with mock (1*PBS), pSV or pM, cells were further transfected with pIL-6 or pM-FL-A141G or recombinant human MMP-2 (rhMMP-2; 25 ng/mL) or alpha5beta1 blocking antibody (10 ul/mL) were added to the medium and cells were incubated for another 24 h. The beta1 integrin activation by Fibronectin (FN) adhesion was achieved by detaching the mock-, pSV- and pM-treated cells by trypsinization after 24 h of transfection and re-plating them on FN-coated culture plates and cells were incubated for another 24 h.Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) following manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was synthesized from 2 ug of total RNA using ImProm-II Reverse Transcription kit (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI). Semi-quantitative PCR was performed using the following set of primers: MMP-2 sense 5'-GTGCTGAAGGACACACTAAAGA-3' and MMP-2 antisense 5'-CCTACAACTTTGAGAAGGATGGCAA-3'; IL-6 sense 5'-GAACTCCTTCTCCACAAG-3' and IL-6 antisense 5'-CTGAAGAGGTGAGTGGCTG-3'; GAPDH sense 5'-GGAGTCAACGGATTTGGTCGTAT-3' and GAPDH antisense 5'-GTCTTCACCACCATGGAGAAGGCT-3' respectively. PCR array was performed using Human JAK/STAT Signaling Pathway RT2ProfilerTM PCR Array kit following manufacturer's instructions (SA Biosciences, Frederick, MD). This array comprises all Stat3 signaling family members including receptors, nuclear co-factors, and co-activators associated with the Stat proteins, STAT-inducible genes, and regulators of STAT pathway. Following PCR conditions using 1 uL of cDNA template were used: 1 cycle of 95 degrees C 10 min and 40 cycles of 95 degrees C 15 s, 60 degrees C 30 s, 72 degrees C 30 s, followed by 1 cycle of 72 degrees C 10 min. Data obtained from three experimental replicates were analyzed using iCycler IQ version 3.1 software (Bio-Rad) and Ct values were converted into fold change, using web-based analysis software (http://pcrdataanalysis.sabiosciences.com/pcr/arrayanalysis.php). Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays was performed using ChIP-ITTM Express Magnetic Chromatin Immunoprecipitation kit following manufacturer's protocol (Active motif, Carlsbad, CA). Briefly, cells were fixed in 37% formaldehyde, and chromatin was sheared by sonication and immunoprecipitated using anti-Stat3 and Normal sheep IgG antibodies by incubation at 4 degrees C for 2-4 hours on a rotor. The immunoprecipitates was collected by using magnetic protein G beads (Millipore, Temecula, CA), which were washed thoroughly to remove non-specific DNA binding. The chromatin was eluted from the beads, and cross-links were removed by overnight incubation at 65 degrees C. DNA was then purified from the beads using the chelating resin solution and about 10 ng of immunoprecipitated DNA was used to detect Stat3 binding to CyclinD1 and c-Myc promoter sequences by standard PCR. The following ChIP primers were used for c-Myc-sense-5'-GAAGCCTGAGCAGGCGGGGCAGG-3'; c-Myc-antisense-5'-GCTTTGATCAAGAGTCCCAG-3' and CyclinD1-sense-5'-AACTTGCACAGGGGTTGTGT-3'; CyclinD1-antisense-5'-GAGACCACGAGAAGGGGTGACTG-3' respectively. The amplification was maintained in a linear range by performing PCR with a serial dilution of input and various cycles (30-40 cycles). Pre-immunoprecipitated input DNA represents 5% of total chromatin used in each reaction before immunoprecipitation. Primers specific to GAPDH, 5'-CGGTGCGTGCCCAGTTG-3' and 5'-GCGACGCAAAAGAAGATG-3' were used for PCR amplification of input samples as a control to monitor equal loading and non-specific IgG immunoprecipitates were also loaded (negative control) as described previously (56). The amplification products were resolved on 2% ethidium bromide agarose gels and visualized under UV light and data represents three experimental replications. Western blotting and immunoprecipitation studies were performed as described previously by Kesanakurti et al. (57). Shortly, whole cell lysates were isolated using radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer and equal amounts of protein were resolved over SDS-PAGE and transferred on to PVDF membrane. Blots were incubated in respective primary and HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies followed by detection using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL). Equal amounts of protein (200ug) were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against MMP-2, alpha5, beta1, alpha5beta1 and non-specific IgG using uMACSTM protein G microbeads and MACS separation columns following manufacturer's protocol and immunoprecipitates were subjected to western blotting. Gelatin zymographic analyses and cytokine array using tumor conditioned media (CM) were performed as described previously (50). Briefly, medium was aspirated from culture plates at 36 h post-transfection, 3 mL of serum-free medium was added and incubated for another 12 h at the end of which tumor-conditioned media (CM) containing the secretory proteins, cytokines and various growth factors was collected. CM was resolved over 0.1% gelatin containing SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Subsequently, gels were washed with 2.5% Triton X-100 to remove SDS, followed by 16- to 20-hour incubation at 37 degrees C in Tris-CaCl2buffer (pH 7.6), stained with Coomassie brilliant blue (0.25%) and destained to visualize the gelatinolytic activity. Cytokine array to detect the secretory levels of various cytokines present in the tumor conditioned media obtained from pSV- and pM-treated cells was performed using a Human Cytokine Array 3 kit following the manufacturer's instructions (Ray Biotech(r), Norcross, GA). The average signal intensity of each cytokine dotted in duplicate on the array was estimated in three independent experimental replicates and denoted as mean+/-SE while biotin-conjugated and unconjugated IgG signals represented positive and negative signals in the analysis. Nuclear proteins were isolated using Biovision Nuclear/Cytosol fractionation Kit (Mountain View, CA) following manufacturer's protocol. EMSA for STAT3 DNA-binding activity was performed using Panomics EMSA Kit (Panomics, Inc. Fremont, CA) as described by Kesanakurtiet al. (50). In brief, nuclear extracts (2*106cells) from different treatments were allowed to bind with biotin-end-labeled DNA in the presence of 2*binding buffer and poly dI-dC (deoxyinosinic-deoxy-cytidylic acid) by incubation at 15 degrees C for 30 min. These DNA-protein complexes were subjected to native gel electrophoresis and transferred onto Hybond-N+membrane (Amersham, Piscataway, NJ). After transfer, DNA was UV cross-linked, and activity was detected by binding with streptavidin-HRP conjugate and chemiluminescent substrate. Proliferation rate in cells was determined by BrDU assay (Roche Applied Science, IN, USA) measuring the incorporation of pyrimidine analogue, 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrDU) during DNA synthesis. Briefly, cells were plated in 96-microwell plates, incubated overnight and subjected to different treatments as described above. Colorimetric estimation of BrDU incorporation was carried out by quantification of antibody-peroxidase reaction product at dual wavelengths of 450/540 nm using multiwell spectrophotometer as described by Ganjiet al. (58). Percentage of BrDU incorporation was compared to mock-treated cells (100%) and represented as mean+/-SE values obtained in at least three independent experiments. Mono-layer colony formation assay was performed as described previously (59). In short, about ~0.5*103cells were seeded in 100 mm plates and different treatments were carried out in triplicate as described above and cells were continued to culture for 10 days to allow colony formation. Hema-3 stained colonies were counted under light microscope to estimate the percentage of colony formation in different treatments. Immunocytochemical and immunohistochemical analyses were performed as described earlier (50). Briefly, after treatments cells in chamber slides were fixed, permeabilized and incubated with respective primary and Alexa Fluor(r)-conjugated secondary antibodies and subsequently mounted. For nuclear counterstaining, 4'-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) was used. For immunohistochemical analysis, de-paraffinized tissue sections (4-5 um) were blocked in 3% BSA in 1*PBS and incubated overnight at 4 degrees C with respective primary antibodies followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor(r)/HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 hour at room temperature. Sections were subsequently counterstained with DAPI, mounted and observed under confocal microscope. For DAB (3,3'-Diaminobenzidine) staining, hematoxylin was used for nuclear staining, mounted and pictured under light microscope. 4910 and 5310 cells (1*106cells per mouse) were injected sterotactically into 4-6-week old femalenu/numice to establish tumor growth as described earlier (50). Tumors were allowed to grow for ten days, the animals were divided into three sets (n=10) and Alzet osmotic pumps (model 2004, ALZET Osmotic Pumps, Cupertino, CA) were implanted for plasmid delivery (dose: 6-8 mg/kg body weight). Brains were excised after 60 days, fixed, paraffinized and the tumor area from every fifth Hematoxylin Eosin (H E) stained tumor section was manually estimated with the aid of a microscope attached to a computer screen, using Image Pro Discovery Program software (Media Cybernatics, Inc., Silver Spring, MD). The tumor volumes were then calculated as summed tumor area on all sections multiplied by width of the sections and plotted as mean+/-SE obtained from a group of ten animals. Data obtained from different sets of treatments were evaluated with one-way ANOVA using Neumann-Keuls method of Sigmastat 3.1. Densitometric analysis was performed using ImageJ 1.42 software (NIH) and data are represented in the form of mean+/-SE obtained from at least three independent repetitions. Significant difference among different treatment groups was denoted by * atp less than =0.05 and ** atp less than =0.01.
