Histone methylation contributes to the regulation of chromatin structure and function, thereby modulating gene expression, including transcription factors. Thus, histone methylation dynamics are critical for numerous biological processes including cell cycle regulation, DNA damage and stress response, as well as development and differentiation12. Histone methylation is tightly regulated by methyltransferases and demethylases that mediate the addition and removal of this modification, and, importantly, dysregulation of histone methylation is implicated in the pathogenesis of cancers, including multiple myeloma (MM)3. For example, the t(4;14) (p16;q32) is present in 15-20% of MM patients, resulting in overexpression ofWHSC1(also known asMMSET/NSD2), a histone H3 lysine 36 (H3K36) methyltransferase. Depletion ofWHSC1expression induces apoptosis in MM cells with t(4;14) translocation4, whereas catalytically active WHSC1 promotes oncogenic transformation in an H3K36 dimethylation-dependent manner5. In addition, ?10% of MM patients without the t(4;14) translocation have inactivating somatic mutations inKDM6A(also known asUTX), an H3K27 demethylase6. Thus, the role of histone methylation modifiers in myelomagenesis is of particular interest. KDM3A (also known as JMJD1A), a member of the Jumonji C-domain-containing histone demethylases, catalyses removal of H3K9 mono- and dimethylation (H3K9me1 and H3K9me2)7and functions as a coactivator for androgen receptor. It is also a crucial regulator of spermatogenesis, embryonic stem cell self-renewal, metabolic gene expression and sex determination789101112. Moreover, recent studies have implicated KDM3A in cancers1314151617. However, little is currently known about the biological role of KDM3A in the pathogenesis of MM. KLF2, a nuclear DNA-binding transcription factor of the Kruppel zinc-finger family, is involved in various biological processes including blood vessel and lung formation, as well as T-cell homeostasis18. KLF2 is also expressed in B cells1920, and absence of KLF2 in B-cell compartment causes abnormalities in B-cell subset identity, cellular trafficking and humoral immunity21222324. Thus, KLF2 plays a crucial role in maintaining homeostasis of B cells and plasma cells; however, the functional significance of KLF2 in MM remains to be defined. IRF4, a member of the interferon regulatory family of transcription factors, is highly expressed in B cells and plasma cells, and has an essential role in controlling B cell to plasma cell differentiation and immunoglobulin class switching252627. Furthermore, IRF4 is involved in myelomagenesis. Specifically, a subset of MM harbours t(6;14)(p25;q32), which results in overexpression ofIRF4(ref. 28). Moreover, not only this subset with translocation ofIRF4but also all other subtypes of MM are dependent on IRF4 (ref. 29). Here we investigate the biological significance of KDM3A in MM pathogenesis. We show that knockdown ofKDM3Aleads to apoptosis in MM cells, and that KDM3A directly upregulatesKLF2andIRF4expression by removing H3K9 methyl marks at their promoters. We further show that knockdown ofKLF2induces apoptosis, and that KLF2 directly transactivatesIRF4promoter. Interestingly,KLF2is also a direct target of IRF4, forming a positive autoregulatory loop in MM cells. In addition, we demonstrate that silencing ofKDM3A,KLF2orIRF4impairs MM cell homing to the bone marrow. These findings suggest that the KDM3A-KLF2-IRF4 axis plays an essential role in MM cell growth and homing to the bone marrow, and therefore represents a potential therapeutic target. We first evaluated expression ofKDM3AmRNA in MM patient samples using publicly available gene expression profiling data because this jumonji demethylase has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several other cancers1314151617. In two independent data sets3031,KDM3Aexpression was significantly elevated in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and MM patient samples compared with normal plasma cells (Fig. 1a). We next examined KDM3A protein expression in MM cells. KDM3A protein was detected by immunoblotting in three patient MM cells and six human MM cell lines tested (Fig. 1b). This signal was increased by overexpression ofKDM3A(Supplementary Fig. 1) and decreased by silencing ofKDM3A(Fig. 2a), confirming specific detection of KDM3A protein. Hence, we hypothesized that KDM3A may also play a role in the pathogenesis of MM. To evaluate the functional role of KDM3A, MM cell lines were transduced with short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targetingKDM3A(shKDM3A #1 and #2) or control shRNA targetingluciferase(shLuc) by lentivirus. Transduction ofKDM3A-specific shRNAs reduced mRNA and protein levels of KDM3A in RPMI8226 and MM.1S cells (Fig. 2aandSupplementary Fig. 2a). Although KDM3A is a demethylase specific to H3K9me1 and me2 (ref. 7), the global H3K9me2 level was not significantly increased in MM cells transduced withKDM3A-specific shRNAs, similar to short interfering RNA-mediatedKDM3Aknockdown in HeLa cells32(Fig. 2a). Importantly, knockdown ofKDM3Asignificantly inhibited MM cell growth (Fig. 2bandSupplementary Fig. 2b), which was partially rescued by expression of theKDM3AcDNA carrying silent mutations in the shKDM3A-targeting sequence (Fig. 2c). Consistent with cell growth inhibition, DNA synthesis was also significantly reduced in MM cells transduced with shRNA targetingKDM3Aversus control shRNA (Supplementary Fig. 2c). To further assess the effect ofKDM3Aknockdown on MM cell growthin vivo, we subcutaneously injected MM.1S cells transduced with shRNA againstKDM3Aor shLuc into severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. As shown inFig. 2d, cell growth was significantly reduced in shKDM3A-treated MM.1S cells compared with shLuc-treated cells. We next examined the molecular mechanism of cell growth inhibition. Quantitative analysis of apoptosis with flow cytometry using apo2.7 staining showed that apoptotic cells were significantly increased inKDM3A-knockdown RPMI8226 cells (Fig. 2e). Furthermore, immunoblot analysis revealed increased cleavage of caspase-8, -7 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) after knockdown ofKDM3Ain RPMI8226, MM.1S and U266 cells (Fig. 2fandSupplementary Fig. 2d). Silencing ofKDM3Ahad little effect on the cell cycle profile (Supplementary Fig. 2e). These results suggest that knockdown ofKDM3Atriggers MM cell cytotoxicity via apoptosis. To identify the downstream effector targets of KDM3A, we next examined gene expression profiles after knockdown ofKDM3Ain RPMI8226 cells. With a cutoff of greater than =1.5-fold downregulation inKDM3A-knockdown cells relative to control cells, a total of 305 probe sets were downregulated inKDM3A-knockdown cells (Fig. 3aandSupplementary Data 1). The list includes genes encoding anti-apoptotic protein BCL2 (ref. 33), essential receptor for plasma cell survival TNFRSF17 (also known as BCMA)3435,BRAF3637andFYN38(Fig. 3a). Among these putative KDM3A targets, a gene of particular interest isKLF2, a key molecule in maintenance of B cell and plasma cell phenotype and function21222324. Another relevant gene isIRF4, given its known crucial role in MM cell survival29. To validate the microarray results, we measuredKLF2andIRF4mRNA using quantitative real-time PCR (QRT-PCR) and confirmed that expression ofKLF2andIRF4was significantly reduced inKDM3A-silenced RPMI8226 cells (Fig. 3b). Immunoblot analysis further confirmed that protein levels of KLF2 and IRF4 were consistently diminished after knockdown ofKDM3A(Fig. 3c,d). We identified a band at ?40 kDa as KLF2 protein, since this signal was increased by overexpression ofKLF2(Supplementary Fig. 3a, right panel) and decreased by silencing ofKLF2(Supplementary Fig. 3b, right panel), reflecting mRNA levels (Supplementary Fig. 3a,b, left panels). Knockdown ofKDM3Aalso decreasedKLF2andIRF4expression at both the mRNA and protein levels in MM.1S and U266 MM cell lines (Fig. 3e,f). To determine whether KDM3A directly regulatesKLF2andIRF4expression, we next analysed KDM3A binding toKLF2andIRF4core promoters (near the transcriptional start sites) using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay in RPMI8226 cells. As a negative control we used theMYOD1promoter region, since this cell line had noMYOD1expression, and silencing ofKDM3Ahad no effect on its expression. As shown inFig. 3g, KDM3A bound to the promoters ofKLF2andIRF4, but not to theMYOD1promoter. Moreover, knockdown ofKDM3Aabrogated KDM3A binding toKLF2andIRF4promoters, indicating that these are specific signals (Fig. 3h). We next evaluated H3K9 methylation levels onKLF2andIRF4promoters after silencing ofKDM3A. H3K9me1 and me2 levels were significantly increased at both promoter regions inKDM3A-knockdown cells compared with control cells (Fig. 3i). Interestingly, we observed an increased trimethyl-H3K9 (H3K9me3) level at theKLF2promoter, as was the case atPrm1andTnp1promoters in the spermatids ofKDM3A-deficient mice8, although KDM3A is unable to demethylate H3K9me3in vitro7. Taken together, these findings suggest that KDM3A directly regulatesKLF2andIRF4expression by demethylating H3K9 methyl marks at their promoters in MM cells. We next confirmed that KLF2 protein was highly expressed in patient MM cells and MM cell lines (Fig. 4a). To investigate the biological significance of KLF2 in MM cells, shRNAs targetingKLF2(shKLF2 #1 and #2) or shLuc were transduced into MM cells by lentivirus. We confirmed that theKLF2expression level was decreased after knockdown ofKLF2using QRT-PCR and immunoblotting (Supplementary Fig. 3b). Importantly, silencing ofKLF2significantly reduced cell growth of MM cell lines (Fig. 4bandSupplementary Fig. 4a), inhibited DNA synthesis (Supplementary Fig. 4b) as well as triggered apoptosis, evidenced by caspase-8, -7 and PARP cleavage (Fig. 4c). Expression ofKLF2cDNA carrying synonymous mutations in the shKLF2-targeting sequence partially rescued RPMI8226 cells from growth inhibition induced by shKLF2 (Fig. 4d). Significantly decreasedin vivogrowth of MM.1S cells transduced with shRNA againstKLF2compared with shLuc-transduced cells was noted in a subcutaneous xenograft model in SCID mice (Fig. 4e). Collectively, these data support the notion that KLF2 sustains MM cell survival. To identify the downstream targets of KLF2 in MM cells, we carried out microarray analysis after knockdown ofKLF2in RPMI8226 cells (Supplementary Data 2). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed significant correlation between the genes downregulated by silencing ofKDM3AandKLF2, indicating that KLF2 is a major downstream effector of KDM3A in MM cells (Fig. 5a). Interestingly, we found that a gene encoding IRF4 was also significantly decreased after knockdown ofKLF2(Supplementary Data 2). To validate theKLF2microarray data, we used QRT-PCR to show thatIRF4mRNA was significantly decreased inKLF2-silenced RPMI8226 cells (Fig. 5b). In a complementary manner, expression ofIRF4was increased inKLF2-overexpressed RPMI8226 cells (Fig. 5c). Consistent with the mRNA level, IRF4 protein expression was reduced after knockdown ofKLF2(Fig. 5d), and expression of KLF2 protein rescued IRF4 protein expression after knockdown ofKLF2(Fig. 5e). Depletion ofKLF2also resulted in decreasedIRF4expression at the mRNA and protein levels in MM.1S and U266 cells (Fig. 5f). To identify the mechanisms regulatingIRF4expression, we next performed promoter reporter assays in 293T cells using reporter constructs containing a DNA fragment of the humanIRF4promoter (between bp -1,200 and +14). As shown inFig. 5g, expression of KLF2 significantly increased luciferase expression in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that KLF2 transactivates theIRF4promoter. There are two KLF consensus-binding motifs within 1.2-kb region of theIRF4promoter (Fig. 5h). To examine whether both elements were required to mediate effects of KLF2, we introduced a series of 5' deletions or mutations of KLF motifs into the promoter region. Deletion of the sequence from -1,200 to -480 had minimal effects on the response to ectopic expression of KLF2 (Fig. 5h). A further deletion to -160 almost abolished KLF2-mediated promoter activation. Furthermore, mutation of the proximal KLF motif significantly reduced the transactivation by KLF2, whereas mutation of the distal KLF motif did not affect the sensitivity to KLF2 expression. These results indicate that this proximal KLF site is at least one of the pivotal sites for transactivation of theIRF4gene by KLF2. There remained weak KLF2-mediated promoter activation in the construct that has a deletion or a mutation of this proximal KLF motif. Although theIRF4promoter within a 160-bp region does not contain KLF consensus-binding motif (5'-CACCC-3'), this region includes GC-rich sites. Sp1-like/KLF proteins have affinities for different GC-rich sites18; therefore, there may be another potential KLF2-binding site in this proximal promoter. Finally, to assess KLF2 binding to theIRF4promoter in MM cells, we carried out ChIP assays in RPMI8226 cells using antibody against KLF2 or control IgG, followed by QRT-PCR. As shown inFig. 5i, endogenous KLF2 bound to theIRF4proximal promoter. This ChIP signal was significantly reduced after knockdown ofKLF2, indicating that this signal is KLF2-specific (Fig. 5j). Taken together, these data provide evidence thatIRF4is a direct target of KLF2 in MM cells. Since transcription factors have been reported to form an autoregulatory feedback loop to sustain their expression in some models293940, we hypothesized that IRF4 might regulateKLF2expression. As expected, knockdown ofIRF4downregulatedKLF2expression at both the mRNA and protein levels in three MM cell lines (Fig. 6a,b). Furthermore, overexpression ofIRF4upregulatedKLF2expression (Fig. 6c), and expression of IRF4 protein partially rescued KLF2 protein expression after knockdown ofIRF4in RPMI8226 cells (Fig. 6d). We next ascertained whether IRF4 directly binds to theKLF2locus. ChIP assays demonstrated that IRF4 bound toKLF2second intron that contains tandem IRF4 motifs (GAAA), but not to the regions that harbour tandem IRF4 motifs, on theKLF2promoter in RPMI8226 cells (Fig. 6e). These data indicate thatKLF2is a direct target of IRF4 in MM cells. Collectively, these results suggest that KLF2 activatesIRF4expression andvice versa, forming a positive autoregulatory loop in MM cells. Consistent with these findings, the set of genes downregulated byIRF4knockdown29was significantly enriched for genes downregulated byKLF2knockdown (Fig. 6f). The bone marrow microenvironment plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of MM4142. In this context, KLF2 has been reported to control homing of plasma cells to the bone marrow24. We therefore hypothesized that the KDM3A-KLF2-IRF4 axis might regulate adhesion and homing of MM cells to the bone marrow. To test this notion, we first evaluated the effect of silencing ofKDM3A,KLF2orIRF4on MM cell adhesion and migrationin vitro. As shown inFig. 7a, knockdown ofKDM3A,KLF2orIRF4decreased adhesion of RPMI8226, MM.1S and U266 cells to bone marrow stromal cells and fibronectin, without affecting the adhesion to bovine serum albumin (BSA), which served as a negative control. Knockdown ofKDM3A,KLF2orIRF4also reduced MM.1S migratory ability towards CXCL12 in a transwell migration assay (Fig. 7b). We finally investigated the effect of silencing ofKDM3A,KLF2orIRF4on MM cell homing to the bone marrowin vivo. Quantitative analysis of the bone marrow homing of MM.1S-Luc-GFP cells was performed. An equal number of MM.1S-Luc-GFP cells stably expressing shRNA targetingKDM3A,KLF2orIRF4was injected via tail vein into sublethally irradiated nonobese diabetic (NOD)-SCID mice. Bone marrow cells of femurs were harvested 24 h after cell injection, and green fluorescent protein (GFP)-positive cells were detected using flow cytometry. The bone marrow homing ofKDM3A,KLF2orIRF4-depleted MM.1S cells was significantly reduced compared with control cells expressing shRNA against red fluorescent protein (RFP) (Fig. 7c). Previous studies have shown that reduced plasma cell homing to the bone marrow is accompanied by decreasedITGB7expression in B-cell-specificKLF2knockout mice24, and that ITGB7 modulates MM cell adhesion and homing to the bone marrow4344. We therefore next hypothesized that the KDM3A-KLF2-IRF4 axis might control expression ofITGB7in MM cells. Of note, silencing ofKDM3A,KLF2orIRF4downregulated expression of ITGB7 in RPMI8226 and MM.1S, which areMAF-translocated cell lines with high ITGB7 expression (Fig. 7dandSupplementary Fig. 5a). This reduced ITGB7 expression was restored by expression of each of these cDNAs in RPMI8226 cells, indicating that decreased ITGB7 expression after knockdown ofKDM3A,KLF2orIRF4is not an off-target effect (Fig. 7e). In contrast, knockdown ofKDM3AorKLF2did not downregulate other MM cell-relevant adhesion molecules such asITGB1,ITGA4,ITGA5,MUC1,SDC1,CD44,CD147andICAM1(Supplementary Fig. 5b). We then evaluated MM cell adhesion after knockdown ofITGB7. Consistent with previous observations4344, knockdown ofITGB7reduced adhesion of RPMI8226 and MM.1S cells to bone marrow stromal cells and fibronectin (Fig. 7f). Taken together, these results suggest that the KDM3A-KLF2-IRF4 axis regulatesITGB7expression inMAF-translocated MM cells, and regulates, at least in part, MM cell adhesion and homing to the bone marrow. KDM3A has recently been implicated in the development of various solid tumours including colorectal cancer, sarcoma, bladder cancer and lung cancer1314151617. The specific roles of KDM3A in the pathogenesis of cancers are now being delineated. For example, Choet al. 17showed that KDM3A regulated theHOXA1gene, which in turn suppressedCCND1transcription, resulting in G1/S arrest in cancer cells. In the current study, we demonstrate that silencing ofKDM3Ainduces apoptosis in MM cells. Unlike other cancers, knockdown ofKDM3Adoes not affectHOXA1expression or cell cycle distribution in MM cells (Supplementary Fig. 2e). Rather our current data demonstrate that KDM3A activates expression ofKLF2andIRF4in MM cells. Depletion ofIRF4has been shown to induce MM cell death29. Our data also show that silencing ofKLF2triggers growth inhibition, indicating that not only IRF4, but also KLF2, are effector molecules in the KDM3A-dependent survival pathway. This notion is supported by GSEA, which shows that the list of genes downregulated byKDM3Asilencing is significantly enriched for genes downregulated byKLF2silencing. Nevertheless, overexpression ofKLF2orIRF4did not rescueKDM3Aknockdown-mediated cell growth inhibition (Supplementary Fig. 6a). In this study, we show that KDM3A sustainsKLF2andIRF4expression through H3K9 demethylation at their promoters. Furthermore, KLF2 and IRF4 mutually transactivate expression of each other, generating a positive feedback loop in MM cells (Fig. 7g). These data suggest that not only each transcription factor but also KDM3A are indispensable for the expression of another transcription factor. In fact, overexpression ofKLF2did not rescue IRF4 expression inKDM3A-knockdown cells as well as overexpression ofIRF4did not rescue KLF2 expression (Supplementary Fig. 6b). These results suggest that overexpression of eitherKLF2orIRF4is not sufficient to rescue theKDM3A-knockdown phenotype, since both KLF2 and IRF4 are crucial in MM cell survival. KDM3A and these transcription factors may also cooperatively regulate the transcription machinery of common target genes critical for MM cell survival and therefore KLF2 or IRF4 may not be enough to rescue the effect ofKDM3Adepletion, although further studies are required to address this issue. Thus, our data support the view that KDM3A maintains MM cell survival by coordinately regulating expression of essential transcription factors through histone demethylation. An interesting question is whether KDM3A contributes to the pathogenesis of other haematologic malignancies by the same mechanism, given its high expression at the same level as MM (Supplementary Fig. 7a). Interestingly, knockdown ofKDM3Aalso significantly impaired growth of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cell lines (Supplementary Fig. 7b). However, knockdown ofKDM3Adid not decreaseKLF2andIRF4expression in DLBCL cell lines (Supplementary Fig. 7c), suggesting that KDM3A sustains survival of DLBCL via a different mechanism than that for MM. These data suggest a cancer-type-specific role of KDM3A. The bone marrow microenvironment promotes MM cell survival4142. Thus, adhesion and homing of MM cells to the bone marrow plays a key role in their growth and survival. Our study demonstrates that the KDM3A-KLF2-IRF4 pathway modulates MM cell adhesion and homing to the bone marrow, suggesting that this pathway maintains MM cell survival not only by preventing apoptosis but also by enhancing the interaction of MM cells with the bone marrow microenvironment (Fig. 7g). We found that knockdown ofKDM3A,KLF2orIRF4downregulatesITGB7expression inMAF-translocated MM cells. ITGB7 mediates MAF-driven MM cell adhesion to bone marrow stromal cells44, as well as MM cell homing to the bone marrow43. ITGB7 may therefore contribute, at least in part, to the KDM3A-KLF2-IRF4 axis-dependent adhesion of MM cells to bone marrow stromal cells. Moreover, knockdown ofKDM3A,KLF2orIRF4impairs adhesion of U266 MM cells, which only expressed low level ofITGB7, suggesting that this pathway mediates adhesion through not only ITGB7 but also via other unknown mechanisms. Recent studies have described the genetic landscape of MM using whole-genome- and whole-exome sequencing, copy number array and cytogenetic analysis using samples from a large number of patients364546. These studies identified mutated oncogenes includingKRAS,NRASandBRAF, as well as copy number gains of these oncogenes. One missense mutation inKDM3Awas found, but it was not recurrent and its functional significance is unknown45. Moreover, no copy number alterations or chromosomal rearrangements involving theKDM3Alocus were identified4546. Nevertheless, MM cells are addicted to KDM3A. Thus, KDM3A addiction in myeloma may be 'non-oncogene addiction,' a concept proposed by Luoet al. 47to describe the increased dependence of cancer cells on normal cellular activities of certain genes and pathways that are not inherently oncogenic by themselves. We found thatKDM3Aexpression is elevated in patient MM cells relative to normal plasma cells (Fig. 1a). The MAF family of transcription factors, known driver oncogenes in MM444849, may be associated with this aberrantKDM3Aexpression in a subset of MM, sinceKDM3Aexpression is modestly but significantly elevated in the subgroup of newly diagnosed MM patients withMAFtranslocations and highMAFexpression (Supplementary Fig. 8a)50. The bone marrow microenvironment may also regulateKDM3Aexpression in MM cells with disease progression, sinceKDM3Atranscript levels in MM cell lines were significantly upregulated after co-culture with bone marrow stromal cells (Supplementary Fig. 8b)42. The present study demonstrates that knockdown ofKDM3Ainduces apoptosis in MM cells. KDM3A-deficient mice exhibit spermatogenesis defects, male-to-female sex reversal and adult onset obesity, but no other additional phenotypes8101112. Hence, there may be a therapeutic window allowing for safely targeting KDM3A. A recent study revealed that KDM3A was distinct from other Jumonji C family members in both its structure and function. KDM3A forms a homodimer through its catalytic domains, and catalyses removal of H3K9 methylation via a two-step process in which two active sites of the dimer are crucial for the enzymatic activity51. This reaction mechanism is totally different from catalytic processes of other JumonjiC H3K9 demethylases such as PHF8 and KIAA1718, which neither form a homodimer nor catalyse successive two-step methylation52. These studies may provide the framework for developing small molecules that specifically inhibit KDM3A. In conclusion, we identify KDM3A as a crucial epigenetic regulator of MM cell survival. We also show that KLF2 and IRF4 are downstream effectors in the KDM3A-dependent survival pathway, and that KLF2 and IRF4 regulate expression of each other. In addition, we demonstrate that this pathway also sustains MM cell adhesion and homing to the bone marrow, suggesting further supporting MM cell survival. Our data therefore suggest that modulation of histone H3K9 methylation by inhibiting KDM3A represents a promising novel therapeutic strategy in MM, and provide the preclinical rationale for development of potent selective drugs targeting KDM3A for clinical evaluation in MM. Human MM cell lines, RPMI8226, MM.1S and U266B1 (U266), were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), and the identity of these cell lines was recently confirmed using STR profiling (Promega GenePrint 10 System). 293T packing cell line was also obtained from ATCC. MM.1S cell line expressing luciferase and GFP, MM.1S-Luc-GFP, was a kind gift from Dr Irene Ghobrial (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, USA).

Cell lines were tested to rule out mycoplasma contamination using the MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza). Bone marrow samples were obtained from MM patients after informed consent and approval by the Institutional Review Board of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. Mononuclear cells were separated by Ficoll-Paque PLUS (GE Healthcare), and MM cells were purified by CD138-positive selection with anti-CD138 magnetic activated cell separation microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec). Long-term bone marrow stromal cells were established by culturing CD138-negative bone marrow mononuclear cells for 4-6 weeks in DMEM containing 100 U ml-1penicillin and 100 mug ml-1streptomycin, supplemented with 15% (v/v) fetal bovine serum55. Gene Expression Omnibus data sets (accession numbers GSE5900 (ref. 30), GSE6691 (ref. 31), GSE36133 (ref. 56), GSE2658 (ref. 50) and GSE20540 (ref. 42)) were used for gene expression analysis. 212689_s_at is the probe for KDM3A transcript on Affymetrix Human Genome U133A Array or Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array. Cells were harvested, washed with PBS and lysed in RIPA buffer (Boston Bioproducts) containing a mixture of protease inhibitor (cOmplete, Mini, Roche) and 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (Sigma-Aldrich). The suspension was incubated for 30 min at 4 degrees C and centrifuged at top speed in a microfuge for 15 min at 4 degrees C. The supernatant was used as whole-cell lysates. For immunoblotting of histone protein, cells were lysed in TOPEX buffer (300 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH7.5, 1% SDS, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mM dithiothreitol and 33.33 unit ml-1Benzonase) with a mixture of protease inhibitor57, incubated for 30 min at 4 degrees C and these lysates were used as whole-cell lysates. Protein concentration was measured with the Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). Samples were mixed with 4 * Laemmli's SDS loading buffer (Boston Bioproducts), boiled at 95 degrees C for 5 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE. After proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad), the membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 and 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoblots were carried out with the antibodies described inSupplementary Table 1, and visualized using the ECL Western Blotting Detection Reagents (GE Healthcare). For stripping off antibody, OneMinute Plus Western Blot Stripping Buffer (GM Biosciences) was used according to the manufacturer's instruction. Signal intensity was quantified using the ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). Uncropped images of all blots are provided inSupplementary Fig. 9. pLKO.1-based plasmids for shRNAs were obtained from the RNAi Consortium (Broad Institute). The RNAi Consortium clone ID and target sequence of each vector are provided inSupplementary Table 2. The humanKDM3AcDNA was amplified using PCR and ligated into the HpaI and XhoI sites of pMSCV retroviral expression vector (Clontech). The humanKLF2cDNA was amplified using PCR and ligated into pCR-Blunt (Invitrogen), and then cloned into the EcoRI site of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) or pMSCV retroviral expression vector (Clontech). The humanIRF4cDNA was amplified using PCR and ligated into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pMSCV retroviral expression vector (Clontech).

On day 2, media were replaced and cells were cultured for an additional 24 h to obtain viral supernatants. On day 3, media containing virus were harvested, passed through 0.45-mum cellulose acetate membrane filters and used fresh for infection. Overall, 1 * 106cells per 1 ml of crude viral supernatants in the presence of 8 mug ml-1polybrene were spinoculated at 800gfor 30 min at room temperature, and then incubated in 5% CO2at 37 degrees C for 5 h. Media were then replaced. After 24 h of viral infection, cells expressing shRNAs were selected with puromycin dihydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich) at 1 mug ml-1for 2 days, and then subjected to each assay. Cells expressing cDNAs were selected with G418 disulfate (Sigma-Aldrich) at 600 mug ml-1for at least 7 days, and clones stably expressing cDNAs were subjected to rescue experiments. Puromycin and G418 concentrations were titrated to identify the minimum concentration of each drug that caused complete cell death of uninfected cells after 2 or 7 days, respectively. Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). cDNA was synthesized from 2 mug of total RNA with oligo(dT) primers using the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen). Real-time PCR was performed in 96-well plates using the Applied Biosystems 7300 or 7500 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). The PCR mixture contained 20 ng of reverse-transcribed RNA, 200 nM of forward and reverse primers and SYBR green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) in a final volume of 20 mul. The conditions were 95 degrees C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 degrees C and 1 min at 60 degrees C. The relative amount of each transcript was calculated using the relative standard curve method. Cyclophilin AmRNA was used as the invariant control, and values were normalized byCyclophilin Aexpression. Specific primers for each gene transcript are shown inSupplementary Table 5. Cell growth was assessed by measuring 3-(4,5-Dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT, Sigma-Aldrich) dye absorbance58. Cells cultured in 96-well plates (100 mul per well) were pulsed with 10 mul of 5 mg ml-1MTT for the last 4 h of cultures, followed by addition of 100 mul of isopropanol containing 0.04 N HCl. Absorbance was measured at 570 nm, with 630 nm as a reference wavelength, using a spectrophotometer (SpectraMax M3, Molecular Devices). DNA synthesis was measured by3H-thymidine (PerkinElmer) uptake58. Cells incubated in 96-well plates were pulsed with3H-thymidine (0.25 Ci per well) during the last 5 h of cultures. Cells were then harvested on fibreglass filters (Filtermat A, PerkinElmer) with Tomtec Cell Harvester, and3H-thymidine incorporation was measured using 1450 MicroBeta TriLux scintillation counter (PerkinElmer). Nine-week-old male CB17 SCID mice (Charles River Laboratories) were used for this study. Overall, 4 * 106viable MM.1S cells transduced with the corresponding shRNA (shKDM3A, shKLF2 or shLuc) were suspended in 100 mul of PBS and then inoculated subcutaneously into the right flank of 200-cGy-irradiated mice. Tumour growth was monitored twice a week using an electronic caliper, and tumour volume was calculated using the formula: (length * width2) * 2-1, where length is greater than width. Animal studies were performed under a protocol approved by the Dana-Farber Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Quantification of apoptotic cells was performed by Apo2.7 immunostaining, which specifically detects the mitochondrial membrane antigen exposed on cells undergoing apoptosis59. Overall, 5 * 105cells were incubated with 100 mug ml-1of digitonin (Sigma-Aldrich) in 100 mul of PBS with 2.5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (PBSF) for 20 min at 4 degrees C to permeabilize cells. After washing with 2 ml of PBSF, cells were incubated with 20 mul of anti-Apo2.7-R-phycoerythrin (PE) or mouse IgG1isotype control-PE (Beckmann Coulter) in 100 mul of PBSF for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. After washing with 2 ml of PBSF, cells were suspended with 1 ml of PBSF and then analysed with flow cytometry (BD FACSCanto II, BD Biosciences). The proportion of apoptotic cells was assessed by measuring PE. In an optimization experiment with IgG1isotype control, the possibility of nonspecific background was excluded. Cells were harvested and fixed with 70% ethanol for 20 min on ice. After washing with PBS twice, cells were incubated with 5 mug ml-1RNase (Roche) in PBS for 20 min at room temperature, and then resuspended in PBS containing 10 mug ml-1propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich). The stained cells were analysed with flow cytometry (BD FACSCanto II, BD Biosciences), and the percentage of cells in G1, S and G2/M phases was determined using the ModFit LT software (Verity Software House). ChIP assay was performed using the SimpleChIP Plus Enzymatic Chromatin IP Kit (Cell Signaling), according to the manufacturer's protocol. For ChIP with anti-KDM3A, ?5 * 106RPMI8226 cells were crosslinked with 1.5 mM ethylene glycolbis (succinimidylsuccinate) in PBS for 20 min at room temperature and then crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. For ChIP with anti-methylated histone lysine, anti-KLF2 and anti-IRF4, 5-10 * 106RPMI8226 cells were crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. After quenching the reaction with glycine solution, samples were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, resuspended and incubated with micrococcal nuclease for 20 min at 37 degrees C. After stopping DNA digestion by adding 50 mM EDTA, nuclear pellets were resuspended and sonicated to break nuclear membranes using Bioruptor (Diagenode) at power levelHfor 15 * 30-s pulses (30-s pause between pulses). After clarifying lysates by centrifugation, supernatants were incubated overnight at 4 degrees C with antibodies described inSupplementary Table 1, followed by incubation with Protein G agarose beads for 2 h. Beads were washed four times, and immune complexes were eluted by heating at 65 degrees C, with occasional vortexing. Crosslinking was then reversed by incubation overnight at 65 degrees C. After treating with proteinase K, DNAs were purified with purification spin column. The amount of DNA recovered from immunoprecipitates with specific antibodies or control IgG was determined with quantitative PCR using Applied Biosystems 7300 or 7500 Real-Time PCR system, which was performed in triplicate. Relative occupancy values were determined by calculating the ratios of the amount of immunoprecipitated DNA to that of the input sample. For ChIP with anti-KDM3A, anti-KLF2 and anti-IRF4, the values were normalized to the values of control IgG, defined as 1.0. For ChIP with anti-methylated histone lysine, data are shown as fold enrichment compared with sh control (shLuc) samples. Specific primers for each amplified region are shown inSupplementary Table 6. Total RNAs for microarray analyses were extracted from RPMI8226 cells transduced with shRNA targetingKDM3AorKLF2, or control shRNA in biological duplicate with the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). Total RNA (1 mug) was processed, and labelled cRNA was hybridized to Human Genome U133 plus 2.0 arrays (Affymetrix), according to the standard Affymetrix protocols. U133 plus 2.0 is a most comprehensive array that contains greater than 54,000 probe sets representing ?38,500 genes. Expression data can be found athttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/under accession number GSE55667. Quality control and normalization of transcriptome data. The quality of scanned array images was determined on the basis of background values, RNA degradation plot, array intensity distribution plots, MA plots, per cent present calls, scaling factors and 3'-5' ratio of beta-actin and GAPDH using various bioconductor packages for R (ref. 60). The normalized transcript expression values were generated from high-quality array images using the Robust Multichip Average algorithm in R using the Bioconductor and associated packages. Robust Multichip Average performed background adjustment, quantile normalization and final summarization of oligonucleotides per transcript using the median polish algorithm61. To identify the outlier arrays, unsupervised analysis was performed using principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering. The outlier arrays were deleted from further supervised analysis. Transcripts were filtered to include only those with absolute expression greater than =40 in at least 10% of samples to reduce the false-positive results. Identification of differentially expressed genes. To identify an accurate signature for target gene knockdown, we performed knockdown using two different shRNAs. Initially individual shRNA signatures of differentially expressed transcripts were generated by comparing control versus target-gene shRNA samples for each shRNA. The transcripts with a 90% lower confidence bound (LCB) of the fold change between the two groups above 1.5 were considered to be differentially expressed62. LCB is a stringent estimate of fold change and has been shown to be the better ranking statistic63. Further, a consensus gene knockdown signature was generated from individual shRNA signatures by including genes that were consistently up- or downregulated by at least 1.15 LCB in both shRNAs and an average LCB greater than 1.5. GSEA was performed using the GSEA-R, a bioconductor implementation of GSEA from Broad Institute64. The GSEA analysis was performed to compare transcriptome signature ofKDM3Aknockdown withKLF2knockdown andvice versa, or transcriptome signature ofIRF4knockdown withKLF2knockdown. Before GSEA analysis, normalization of expression data and generation of transcriptome signature were performed using an approach described in the previous section. Transcriptome signature ofIRF4knockdown was obtained from previous report29. Analysis was run with 1,000 permutations and a classic statistic; NES, normalized enrichment score and nominalPvalue was measured. pIRF4(1200) is the humanIRF4promoter-luciferase reporter construct that spans positions -1,200 to +14 relative to the transcription start site. pIRF4(520), pIRF4(480) and pIRF4(160) contain deletion constructs with the 5' end noted in parentheses, and the same 3' end point at +14. The 5' flank region of the humanIRF4was amplified with PCR using genomic DNA isolated from RPMI8226 cells as a template. Then, the digested PCR product was cloned into the XhoI-EcoRV sites of pGL4.10[luc2] (Promega). Base substitution mutants were generated in pIRF4(520) with the QuikChange II Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies), according to the manufacturer's protocol. The details of the primers are shown inSupplementary Tables 3andSupplementary Table 4. 293T cells were plated at a density of 1.2 * 105per 24-well plate on the day before transfection. Cells were transfected with luciferase reporter plasmid (0.2 mug), the indicated amount of expression plasmid and pSV-beta-Gal (Promega; 0.1 mug) with TransIT-LT1 Transfection Reagent (Mirus), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The total amount of DNA per well was kept constant by adding the empty vector, which has the same vector backbone of expression plasmid. After 24 h, the cells were washed with PBS and lysed in 100 mul of Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega). The suspension was incubated for 15 min at room temperature and centrifuged at top speed in a microfuge for 1 min. The supernatant was used for firefly luciferase activity assay. Values are normalized to beta-galactosidase activity65. Bone marrow stromal cells were plated at a density of 1 * 104per well in a 96-well plate 1 day before the adhesion assay. Human fibronectin- or BSA-coated plates were purchased from R D Systems. MM cells were prelabelled by incubating in the presence of 1 muM calcein AM (Molecular Probes) at 37 degrees C for 30 min. After washing with PBS with calcium and magnesium (PBS(+)) twice, labelled cells were resuspended in PBS(+) at a concentration of 1 * 106 ml-1. Overall, 1 * 105cells were then incubated in 96-well plates coated with bone marrow stromal cells, fibronectin or BSA at 37 degrees C for 2 h. After measuring the fluorescent intensity of pre-wash samples, wells were washed two to three times with PBS. The fluorescent intensity of adherent cells was then quantified using a fluorescence plate reader (SpectraMax M3, Molecular Devices) at an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and an emission wavelength of 525 nm. Per cent adhesion was determined by calculating the ratios of the fluorescent intensity of post-wash sample to that of pre-wash sample. For migration assay, 4 * 105MM.1S cells suspended in 200 mul of RPMI1640 medium with 1% fetal bovine serum were placed in the upper chambers, and 500 mul of RPMI1640 medium with 1% fetal bovine serum with CXCL12 (20 nM) were placed in the lower chambers of 24-well transwell plates (pore size 8.0 mum; Costar). After 4-h incubation at 37 degrees C, cells migrated to the lower chambers were labelled with calcein AM (Molecular Probes) at 37 degrees C for 1 h and were quantified using a fluorescence plate reader (SpectraMax M3, Molecular Devices), at an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and emission wavelength of 525 nm. Overall, 4 * 105MM.1S cells were also labelled and quantified as input. Per cent migration was determined by calculating the ratios of the fluorescent intensity of migrated cells to that of input cells. MM.1S-Luc-GFP cells stably expressing the corresponding shRNA (shKDM3A, shKLF2, shIRF4 or control shRFP; 15 * 106viable cells) were injected via tail vein into 300-cGy-irradiated NOD-SCID male mice (Charles River Laboratories). Twenty-four hours after injection, mice were killed, and the bilateral femurs of each mouse were collected. After crunching femurs, bone marrow cells are sieved through a 70-mum filter, and red blood cells were lysed with ACK Lysing Buffer (Lonza). The bone marrow cells were then resuspended in PBS with 2% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, and GFP-positive cells were detected with flow cytometry (BD FACSCanto II, BD Biosciences). Data are shown as relative homing efficacy compared with control cells expressing shRFP. Animal studies were performed under a protocol approved by the Dana-Farber Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Student'st-test or analysis of variance followed by Dunnett's test was used to compare differences between the treated group and relevant control group. A value ofP less than 0.05 was considered significant. Accession codes:The microarray data have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus database under accession codeGSE55667.
