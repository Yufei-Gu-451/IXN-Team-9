Two centuries ago, the elements bromine and iodine were discovered in seawater and seaweed ashes, respectively (Balard, 1826;Gay-Lussac, 1813). Due to their unique evolutionary history and phylogenetic distance from other important eukaryotic lineages (BhattacharyaNone, 1991;Baldauf, 2003), brown algae present some remarkable chemical and physiological adaptations which are also reflected at the genome level (CockNone, 2010), making them fascinating experimental models, not only for phycologists, but for a community of interdisciplinary researchers. This includes the recently described function of iodide as an extracellular antioxidant protecting the surface ofLaminaria digitata(Hudson) Lamouroux against oxidative stress (KupperNone, 2008). In fact, this constituted the first documented case of an inorganic antioxidant in a living system - and the chemically simplest antioxidant known. Indeed, brown algae of the genusLaminariaare the strongest accumulators of iodine in life on Earth (SaenkoNone, 1978;KupperNone, 1998;Ar GallNone, 2004), and they are a major contributor to the biogeochemical flux of iodine (McFiggansNone, 2004) and, to a lesser extent, brominated and iodinated halocarbons to the atmosphere (CarpenterNone, 2000). However, while the uptake, metabolism, and biogeochemical cycling of iodine byLaminariaare well studied (KupperNone, 2011), hardly anything is known about bromine in this context. The uptake of iodide from seawater inLaminariainvolves vanadium haloperoxidases (VHPOs) (KupperNone, 1998) and its strongest accumulation in this species seems to be linked to the presence of a particular VHPO subclass, the iodoperoxidases, specific for iodide oxidation (ColinNone, 2003,2005). Most of the iodine is accumulated in the apoplast of the cortical cell layer (VerhaegheNone, 2008b). Following a hypothesis from the biomedical field about a potential ancestral role of iodide as an antioxidant in the evolution of the thyroid in vertebrates (Venturi and Venturi, 1999), it was shown that iodide is the accumulated form of iodine inLaminaria, and that it indeed serves as a simple, inorganic antioxidant, protecting the apoplast and thallus surface against both aqueous and gaseous oxidants (KupperNone, 2008). This study also revealed that the iodide in the liquid microlayer on the emergedLaminariathallus surface can efficiently scavenge ozone from the gas phase, resulting in atmospheric particle formation, which can act as cloud condensation nuclei (McFiggansNone, 2004;PalmerNone, 2005). In this study, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) has proven to be a suitable, non-invasive tool to probe the chemical state and solution environment of accumulated iodine. However, this technique is equally suitable to investigate the speciation of bromine in kelps (FeitersNone, 2005a,b;Strange and Feiters, 2008). The first line of defence against pathogens inLaminariais an oxidative burst (KupperNone, 2001), which is considered a central element of eukaryotic defence in general (Wojtaszek, 1997) and which, in the case of kelp species, serves to control bacterial biofilms (KupperNone, 2002). Among its triggers are oligoguluronates (GG) (KupperNone, 2001, 2002), bacterial lipopolysaccharides (KupperNone, 2006), prostaglandin A2(ZambounisNone, 2012), methyl jasmonate, and polyunsaturated free fatty acids (KupperNone, 2009). InL. digitata, early transcriptional defence responses are similar to those in land plants but also involve tightly regulated halogen metabolism which might play roles in more sophisticated chemical defence reactions including distance signalling (CosseNone, 2009;ThomasNone, 2011). In brown algae, bromide and VHPOs have also been shown to catalyse oxidative cross-linking between cell-wall polymers, suggesting a role in spore and gamete adhesion and cell-wall strengthening (for reviews, seePotin and Leblanc, 2006;La BarreNone, 2010). This study addresses the biological significance of bromine versus iodine metabolism inLaminaria. First, iodine and bromine levels in different types of tissues ofLaminariawere investigated using inductively coupled plasma (ICP) MS. Then K-edge XAS was applied to probe the stored chemical state of these elements under different physiological conditionsin vivo(both steady-state unstressed and oxidatively stressed) in the different tissue types ofLaminariaand to draw comparisons and potential functional links between bromine and iodine metabolism. Finally, the potential antioxidant properties of bromide and iodide were compared in whole-blood oxidative burst assays andin vitroelectron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) assays. Oxidative stress experiments for XAS were conducted as described previously (KupperNone, 2008). L. digitatasporophytes (approx. 2-100cm in size) were collected in the sublittoral at Roscoff (Brittany) and Helgoland (Germany) and kept in tanks with aerated, running seawater between 4-10 degrees C until use. Oligoguluronate elicitors (GG) were applied at a final concentration of 100 mug ml-1. Typically, experiments were conducted with around 5gLaminariafresh weight in 100ml natural seawater, from which both tissue samples of approximately 0.5g and aliquots of seawater medium of 15ml were removed directly at the onset of the stress, and then at intervals of 1, 3, 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, 180 minutes, and 24 hours, respectively. L. digitatatissue samples were cut out of the phylloid blade and blotted dry on paper tissue. They were immediately fitted into a plexiglass frame and sealed with Capton tape. All samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. This experiment was repeated around 15 times with minor variations in sample volume, total algal biomass, and seawater volume. Isolated cell walls and a polyphenol-enriched fraction were prepared fromL. digitatasporophytes collected in the sublittoral at Roscoff (Brittany), as described previously (Mabeau and Kloareg, 1987;ConnanNone, 2006). The polyphenol-enriched fraction is a methanol/water extract (50:50) ofLaminariablades at 40 degrees C followed by vacuum drying. An industrial alginate sample was obtained from a major alginate manufacturer (DANISCO); the production followed a well-established technique (McHugh, 1987). The other tissue samples were prepared as described before (KupperNone, 2008), by dissecting, blotting/drying, and sealing in a plexiglass frame sealed with Capton tape, followed by flash-freezing in liquid N2. The extraction and purification of the native VHPOs fromL. digitatahave been described previously (ColinNone, 2003). Iodine and bromine contents in freeze-driedL. digitatatissue and cell-wall samples were analysed by ICP-MS after pyrohydrolysis separation, as described previously (Schnetger and Muramatsu, 1996;Chai and Muramatsu, 2007). Concentrations obtained are given in ppm (i.e. mug halogen per g of freeze-dried material). Bromine and iodine K-edge XAS measurements and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) data reduction were carried out at the EMBL Outstation Hamburg at DESY, Germany, as described previously (FeitersNone, 2005a). PDB files for the multiple scattering units of the aromatic amino acids were generated using ChemBio3D Ultra. Blood was withdrawn from healthy volunteers into blood collection tubes containing sodium citrate (Sarstedt). Neutrophils were isolated using density gradient centrifugation and resuspended in Hanks Balanced Salt solution at a density of 1,000,000 cells ml-1. Neutrophils were mixed 1:1 with 20 muM 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate and incubated (37 degrees C, 5% CO2) for 30 minutes prior to seeding into a 96-well plate. Test compounds were added to triplicate wells at a range of concentrations (0.01-100mM). Oxidative burst was stimulated by addition of 0.1nM phorbol myristate acetate (RepineNone, 1974). The plate was incubated at 37 degrees C with fluorescence readings taken every 10 minutes. Vmaxwas calculated for each test group over four data points. Percentage activity was calculated by comparing test group Vmaxto control Vmax. The antioxidant potential of KBr and KI was determined by EPR. Stock solutions of KI and KBr (0.10M in H2O) were diluted as required to the final working concentration. Both compounds were tested with the radical-generating systems menadione (in DMSO) and pyrogallol (in H2O) at a final concentration of 150 muM in the presence of the spin trap, tempone-H (50 muM). Both menadione and pyrogallol undergo auto-oxidation under oxic (atmospheric oxygen) conditions to generate oxygen-centred radicals. The spin-trap chosen is recognized to be selective for oxygen-centred radicals (MejaNone, 2008). Menadione incubation was performed in double-distilled H2O, and pyrogallol incubation in PBS, with appropriate vehicle controls (i.e. PBS or H2O only) run as blanks. Incubations were performed at 37 degrees C with readings taken at 0, 15, 30, 45, and 60min using a benchtop MS200 X-Band EPR spectrometer (Magnettech, Berlin, Germany) set with the following parameters: microwave frequency 9.30-9.55 GHz; B0field 3344 Gauss; sweep width 50 Gauss; sweep time 60 s; modulation amplitude 2.0 Gauss; microwave power 10 mW. Formation of the spin-adduct (4-oxo-tempo) by oxidizing radical species was measured and the amplitude of the first derivative spectra obtained (arbitrary units) was plotted against time following subtraction of appropriate blank measurements. Radical generation was estimated by measuring the area under the resultant linear plot for each individual 60-min incubation, prior to mean and standard error calculations (Graphpad Prism version 5.0). Very little is known about the chemical biology and atmospheric chemistry of bromine, despite the accumulating wealth of knowledge for iodine regarding physiology and biochemistry of animal and algal systems and its importance in biogeochemical cycles (CarpenterNone, 2009;KupperNone, 2011). Brominating oxidants are formed by eosinophils, capable of destroying a wide range of prokaryotic and eukaryotic targets (WeissNone, 1986) and marine macroalgae are known to emit bromocarbons at high rates (Carpenter and Liss, 2000;CarpenterNone, 2000). The recent discovery that the accumulation of iodide serves the provision of a simple, inorganic antioxidant in the kelpLaminaria(KupperNone, 2008) prompted the current investigation of the chemical speciation and biological significance of bromine in this important model system with a similar, interdisciplinary array of approaches and techniques. The first objective was to determine bromine levels in various types ofLaminariatissues by ICP-MS. Most of the samples studied had previously served for XAS analyses reported below. Overall, the ICP-MS results of bromine levels inL. digitatablades and stipes (Table 1; forLaminariaanatomy, seeSupplementary Fig. S1, available atJXBonline) were consistent with previous results measured in freeze-dried and chemically fixed tissues using neutron activation analysis (VerhaegheNone, 2008b). The highest bromine levels were encountered in the holdfast (? 2000 ppm) and cortical stipe tissues (? 1800-1900 ppm), while the lowest concentrations were found in foliar blade (966+/-77 ppm) and medullary stipe tissues (654+/-26 ppm). The highest iodine levels (also measured by ICP-MS), up to more than 57,000 ppm, were observed in outer cortical tissues ofLaminariastipes, followed by the inner cortex (?40,000 ppm) while the lowest tissue concentrations were found in the medulla of stipes (?1000 ppm). Foliar blade tissues contained close to 5000 ppm (but due to the anatomy of the blade, it was not possible to separate cortical from medullary tissue; it is assumed that the cortex would show much higher iodine levels than the medulla). There was a clear pattern of higher bromine and iodine concentrations in cortical, foliar blade and holdfast tissues as opposed to the thallus medulla, underlining the characteristics of halogen accumulation as a brown algal surface process. Overall, accumulation of iodine was much more pronounced than that of bromine with total concentrations up to over an order of magnitude higher. Considering the much lower concentration of iodine in seawater (0.5 muM in total, with about equal levels of iodide and iodate) in comparison to bromide (0.8mM), the accumulation factor of iodine from seawater toLaminariatissues (around five orders of magnitude) was much more extreme than for bromine (less than 1 order of magnitude). In contrast, industrial sodium alginate fromL. digitatacontained very low and similar bromine (12+/-4 ppm) and iodine levels (20+/-3 ppm). Total non-volatile iodine and bromine content of samples of various tissue parts and cell-wall components ofLaminaria digitata. Determined by ICP-MS. Algal tissue samples were freeze-dried and ground in liquid nitrogen. n, technical replicates. XAS was used to elucidate thein vivospeciation of bromine and to compare it to that of iodine. Representative Br K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge spectra are shown inSupplementary Fig. S2and Br K-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and corresponding Fourier transforms are shown with their simulations inFigs. 1-3. As described in detail in the supporting information (available atJXBonline), three types of contributions to the biological Br EXAFS spectra obtained withLaminariathallus samples could be distinguished, which were representative of three different chemical environments, viz. Br-surrounded by hydrogen-bonding molecules (Fig. 1), Br covalently incorporated into aromatic moieties (Fig. 2), and Br-incorporated in solid KCl (Fig. 3), with examples of the corresponding edge X-ray absorption near-edge spectra inSupplementary Fig. S2(traces A, C/D, and B, respectively). Bromine and iodine K-edge EXAFS and corresponding Fourier transforms are given inSupplementary Figs. S3andS4, and all iterative refinement parameters of the simulations for Br and I are given inSupplementary Tables S1andS2, respectively. The XAS results inFig. 1clearly show that bromide is the dominant form of bromine inLaminaria, and that it is present in a non-covalently bound form, associated with heteroatoms from biomolecules by hydrogen-bonding. Br was found to be predominantly hydrogen-bonded to biomolecules in fresh and lyophilizedLaminaria(Fig. 1, traces D and E), but the larger number of oxygen atoms found for oligo-GG stress (Fig. 1, trace C) compared to freshLaminariaindicated that a larger fraction of it was hydrated under oligo-GG stress rather than bound to biomolecules in freshLaminaria. This is analogous to the situation reported earlier (KupperNone, 2008) for iodide inLaminaria, and it is in line with the differences observed between the dissolving of iodide by small solvent molecules, resulting in interaction with many solvent atoms, or by larger solvent molecules, where fewer solvent atoms can interact (Tanida and Watanabe, 2000). In contrast, the XAS spectra of freeze-driedLaminariatissues rehydrated with 2mM H2O2(Supplementary Fig. S3, trace A) could be interpreted by the incorporation of bromide in aromatic substrates both in the rehydrated thallus and in the cell-wall fraction, either directly by the oxidative activation of Br-by H2O2or by the action of haloperoxidases. An analogous observation was made for iodide inLaminaria(Supplementary Fig. S4, trace H;KupperNone, 2008). Of theLaminariaparts, the cell wall was the only one that displayed this spectrum (Supplementary Fig. S3, trace B). While the spectrum of theLaminariaholdfast (Fig. 1, trace F) resembled that of wholeLaminaria, indicating the presence of H-bonded Br-, those of otherLaminariathallus parts (apart from the blade) inFig. 3, viz. the methanol extract enriched in polyphenols, the cortical tissue, the stipe, and the meristem, appeared to contain bromide in the position of a Cl defect in a KCl crystal. It is possible to interpret this result as due to the presence of free Br-which co-precipitates with KCl upon cooling of the sample for the XAS measurement, but the concept that Br-is also associated with solid KCl under physiological conditions inLaminariacannot be excluded. It should be noted that the highest concentrations of K+and Cl-ions in the cortex and medulla of dry weightLaminaria(120,000 and 109,000 ppm, respectively (VerhaegheNone, 2008a), which turn out to be equimolar amounts upon correction for the atomic weight) imply that 22.9 % of the solid material was KCl. The new data are in accordance with the report of bromine localization inLaminaria(VerhaegheNone, 2008a), which suggests that bromine is less diffusible than iodine in stipe tissues and is proportionally more abundant in strong association with the cell walls. By merging these different approaches - microchemical imaging (VerhaegheNone, 2008b), XAS, ICP-MS, EPR, and whole-blood antioxidant assays - this study sought to provide new hypotheses about bromination processes and the function of bromine in brown algal kelps.

See alsoSupplementary Table S1. A comparison of the pattern of peaks in the Fourier transform of the Br EXAFS for the nativeL. digitataVHPOs (Fig. 2Dfor iodoperoxidase,Supplementary Fig. S3Cfor bromoperoxidase) with a number of brominated amino acids (3-Br-tryptophan, 4-Br-phenylalanine, and 3,5-di-Br-tyrosine inFigs. 2E,2C, and 2A, respectively) showed evidence for incorporation of Br into the aromatic moiety of the amino acids. This was, however, not in the form of 3,5-dibromo-tyrosine as established earlier for the bromoperoxidase ofAscophyllum nodosumby XAS (also included inFig. 2as trace B) and mass spectrometry (FeitersNone, 2005b). Simulations of theLaminariahaloperoxidase Br XAS with structural models based on 5-Br-tryptophan or 4-bromo-phenylalanine, respectively, confirmed that the Br was attached to an aromatic group, but did not allow unambiguous identification of the type of amino acid (3-bromo-tyrosine, 4-bromophenylalanine, 5-bromotryptophan), except for the exclusion of 3,5-dibromo-tyrosine. The native bromoperoxidase ofA. nodosumcontained Br in the surface tyrosine residues 398 (rarely monobrominated) and 447 (frequently dibrominated) (FeitersNone, 2005b). In fact, the alignment of the different VHPO proteins did not show a strict conservation of tyrosine residues at these two positions, but phenylalanine residues inL. digitataVHPOs (Supplementary Fig. S5). Both types of native VHPOs fromLaminariawere brominated; the enzymes appeared to have been exposed to conditions in the algae or during enzyme extraction where they were brominated. It should be noted that the bromoperoxidase is capable of brominating itself, whereas the iodoperoxidase is unable to react with bromide (ColinNone, 2005). XAS of iodine inLaminaria(Supplementary Fig. S4) shows that it was present as iodide, which is hydrogen-bonded to large biomolecules in freshLaminaria, but partly mobilized as hydrated iodide upon addition of an oligo-GG elicitor, as reported earlier (KupperNone, 2008), and of H2O2. The iodine EXAFS showed no evidence of incorporation in KCl crystals, as found for the bromine. Iodide has been found (VerhaegheNone, 2008b) to be associated more exclusively than bromide with peripheral tissue, where the potassium and chloride concentrations are relatively low; moreover, the iodide ion would fit even more poorly in the KCl lattice than the bromide ion, due to its larger size. Consistent with previously published results (CarpenterNone, 2000;PalmerNone, 2005;ThomasNone, 2011),Laminariaemitted predominantly brominated halocarbons in the unstressed steady state, while an oxidative burst following GG treatment resulted in strongly increased emissions of iodocarbons (Supplementary Fig. S6). Arguably, the more physiological form of oxidative stress (caused by GG) was met by a mobilization of the iodide antioxidant reservoir, thus providing cell-wall-bound haloperoxidase enzymes both with their preferred substrate and also at a locally higher concentration than bromide, leading to an increased incorporation of iodine into organic molecules, resulting in mono- and multiple iodinations. However, it has to be noted that the total emission rate of iodine via iodocarbons was at least three orders of magnitude lower than the inorganic iodine efflux previously reported (KupperNone, 1998, 2008;ChanceNone, 2009). This efflux was dominated by CH2I2, CH3I, CHBr2I, and C2H5I (Supplementary Fig. S6B). Interestingly, both vanadium iodoperoxidase and vanadium bromoperoxidase genes are upregulated after GG elicitation (CosseNone, 2009) andin silicoprotein sequence targeting suggested cell-wall localization (ColinNone, 2003,2005). CollenNone(1996)found that adding H2O2toMeristiella gelidiumincreased production of bromo- and chlorocarbons whereas iodocarbon levels were unaltered. Comparison of exogenous oxidative stress (exogenous H2O2) versus a GG-elicited oxidative burst (Supplementary Fig. S6A,B) suggested that inL. digitata, simple extracellular addition of H2O2did not adequately mimic the rapid physiological ROS formation plus mobilization of accumulated iodide and volatile halocarbons that occurs during a GG-triggered oxidative burst. Under stress conditions, spontaneous chemical reaction of I-with H2O2and the activity of constitutive algal haloperoxidases are likely to generate hypoiodous acid (HOI) in equilibrium with I2. HOI and I2are highly reactive and readily react with dissolved organic matter to produce organoiodine compounds (TruesdaleNone, 1995;Bichsel and von Gunten, 1999;CarpenterNone, 2005), analogous to bromocarbon synthesis by HOBr/bromoperoxidase (TheilerNone, 1978). The rates of production of iodine- and bromine-containing compounds will depend on the relative concentrations of I-and Br-, the specificity of the haloperoxidase enzymes, dissolved organic matter availability, and type. Carbon skeletons could potentially originate from the alga itself (e.g. from the release of free fatty acids), which would then be iodinated and oxidized in the strongly oxidizing conditions prevalent during the oxidative burst (KupperNone, 2001). Critically for the production of volatile halocarbons, the substantial I-efflux would shift the balance between Br-and I-, increase HOI production relative to HOBr, and swamp the haloperoxidase system with iodide such that iodocarbons dominate the blend of halocarbon volatiles produced. The absence of a bromide efflux during oxidative stress (supporting information) contrasted with the strong iodide efflux observed under the same conditions (KupperNone, 2008;ChanceNone, 2009) due to the predominance of iodide accumulation compared to bromide. An antioxidant assay based on phorbol myristate acetate-stimulated human blood cells showed that KBr has significant antioxidant activity only at the highest concentration tested, 100mM (Fig. 4). At all lower concentrations (0.01, 0.1, 1 and 10mM), no significant anti- or pro-oxidant effect was detected. Remarkably, in the same assay, iodide showed a pro-oxidant effect at 0.01, 0.1, 1, and 10mM which, however, was attenuated at 10mM KI by the presence of 1mM KBr. Only the highest iodide concentration, 100mM, had a strong antioxidant effect in this assay. Neutrophil antioxidant assay at varying concentrations of bromide and iodide. The results of thein vitroEPR assay that discriminated between scavenging of superoxide and hydroxyl radicals are shown inFig 5. KBr showed a trend towards scavenging of superoxide at concentrations greater than 1mM, reaching statistical significance at 100mM. KI failed to scavenge superoxide at the same concentrations and showed a trend for pro-oxidant activity. In contrast, both KBr and KI exhibited complex interactions with hydroxyl radicals, with a pro-oxidant effect at moderate concentrations (10-100 muM) being overwhelmed by antioxidant effects at high concentrations (significant at 100mM). The results show that the reactivity of the inorganic halide with radicals is complex and concentration dependent. High Br-concentrations ( greater than 1mM) were found to scavenge superoxide whilst equivalent concentrations of I-tended to exacerbate radical generation. In contrast, both halides increased radical generation at moderate (10-100 muM) concentrations and were equally effective at sequestering hydroxyl radicals at concentrations greater than 1mM. Indeed, similar concentration-dependent pro- and antioxidant behaviour is known for a range of biological antioxidants (Long and Halliwell, 2001). At present, there is no evidence to support a mechanism for the phenomenon in the case of iodide and bromide, but it is tempting to hypothesize that it might (as is the case with some other antioxidants) hinge around the balance between reduction of metal ions to more reactive reduced forms for mediating Fenton chemistry (e.g. Fe2+; pro-oxidant) and radical-scavenging activity (antioxidant). Electron paramagnetic resonance determination of ROS by spin trapping.

This study shows thatL. digitatasporophytes contain bromine as bromide, similarly to the more pronounced accumulation of iodide, but to a lesser degree and also bound to aromatic molecules. The chemicalin vivospeciation of bromide inLaminariaresembles that of iodine - it is overwhelmingly associated with biomolecules via hydrogen bonds. Also similarly to the previously documented case of iodide (KupperNone, 2008), oxidative stress results in increased hydration. However, and even though in principle the same reaction pathways would apply for both bromide and iodide (such as halide-assisted disproportionation of hydrogen peroxide;Vilter, 1995;KupperNone, 2008), bromide appears to be less suitable as an antioxidant than iodide, based on both thermodynamic and kinetic considerations regarding the reactions of halides with the oxidants relevant in a living system. Its function is likely not only that of an antioxidant but also, as found in other brown algae not showing a specific iodine concentration, a matter of interacting macromolecules (such as cross-linking inFucales;Potin and Leblanc, 2006), and involvement in different and complementary roles for chemical defence, as also found in red algae (such as disruption of the quorum-sensing systems of bacterial biofilms;Butler and Carter-Franklin, 2004). However, the antioxidant function of iodide clearly depends on the nature of the oxidant considered, as established by neutrophil oxidative burst and EPR assays. With regard to superoxide and as highlighted by both the neutrophil oxidative burst and EPR assays, iodide was actually pro-oxidant between 0.1-10mM; only higher concentrations were antioxidant. However, superoxide did not accumulate during oxidative stress inLaminariabut was rapidly converted to hydrogen peroxide by the action of superoxide dismutase (KupperNone, 2001) and scavenged by bromide (this study;Fig. 5). In contrast, iodide is a very efficient antioxidant against hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radicals, and ozone (KupperNone, 2008), and it is well established that at least hydrogen peroxide (KupperNone, 2001, 2002) and ozone (PalmerNone, 2005;KupperNone, 2008) can exist at concentrations physiologically relevant forLaminaria. In one-electron oxidations, only iodide - not bromide - reacts exergonically with hydroxyl and superoxide radicals (Luther III, 2011). Among the two-electron reactions, iodide is still by far the most favourable reaction partner for many biologically relevant oxidants (ozone, singlet oxygen, and hydrogen peroxide), even though bromide and chloride show favourable (albeit considerably smaller) DeltaGRvalues (Luther III, 2011) for the reaction with ozone and hydrogen peroxide (and the EPR data suggest that bromide might have some additional benefits over iodide with regard to superoxide radical). Similarly, the reaction of iodide with ozone, singlet oxygen, and hydrogen peroxide was several orders of magnitude faster than that of bromide or chloride (Table 2). Finally, it should be highlighted that iodide is locally the predominant halide species and could be the preferred substrate of cell-wall-localized vanadium haloperoxidases over bromide and chloride (VerhaegheNone, 2008a). Haloperoxidases also considerably accelerate the halide-assisted disproportionation of hydrogen peroxide (Vilter, 1995;KupperNone, 2008). Kinetics of oxygen species with halides and other reductants. The EPR results highlight the importance of having the correct blend of antioxidants present in the correct compartment in order to ensure beneficial as opposed to detrimental or neutral effects. For example, high concentrations of Br-, but not I-, could represent a useful antioxidant in defence against superoxide (e.g. oxidative burst), whilst high (but not moderate) concentrations of both Br-and I-could protect against hydroxyl radical (e.g. derived from hydrogen peroxide via Fenton chemistry). From an evolutionary perspective, therefore, it would prove advantageous to maintain large stores of halides in inactive (caged) forms (i.e. bound to organic entities) and to release them in high concentrations in response to stress. A combined assault with Br-and I-would have the added benefit of targeting different ROS species, thus providing comprehensive protection. Overall, inLaminaria, bromide compares with iodide as follows. (i) There is no strong accumulation of bromide from seawater, and no detectable bromide efflux upon oxidative stress. (ii) An oxidative burst results in a shift to increased iodocarbon emissions (this study;PalmerNone, 2005;ThomasNone, 2011). (iii) The reaction of bromide with most of the biologically relevant oxidants is not favourable, neither in a thermodynamic nor in a kinetic sense. Therefore, the results suggest that, while the extracellular antioxidant defence ofLaminariais primarily based on iodide, iodide and bromide may complement each other in the face of different oxidants such as superoxide and that the role of bromine and brominated compounds in macroalgae is more complex than previously thought (Table 3). Comparison of the key features of iodine and bromine metabolism inLaminaria. This work constitutes the first study about the physiology of bromide as a potentially comparable antioxidant. The results show that bromide complements iodide as an inorganic, extracellular antioxidant inLaminaria, in particular against superoxide, but also that it is less effective against most other biologically relevant oxidants and that its function is more diverse than that of iodide. It is proposed to call the preferential accumulation and targeted release of iodide upon oxidative stress, in comparison to bromide, the 'iodide switch'. This work suggests that the accumulation of iodide and the iodide switch are central and unique features of the evolution of morphologically complex, large brown algal kelps such asLaminaria. The evolutionary origin of this unique antioxidant system remains one of the most intriguing research questions in this context. Supplementary data are available atJXBonline. Supplementary Fig. S1.
