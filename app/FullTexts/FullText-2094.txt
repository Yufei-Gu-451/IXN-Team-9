Fructans are oligo- and polysaccharides that are produced by many plant species, including temperate monocots and dicots, as well as by some bacteria and fungi (Pollock, 1986). In angiosperms, fructans can be found in about 15% of all species (Hendry, 1987), including many temperate cereals like wheat and barley. Fructans are mainly synthesized and stored in plant vacuoles by a group of fructosyltransferases belonging to plant glycoside hydrolase family 32 enzymes (Pollock, 1986;Darwen and John, 1989;VijnNone., 1997;Ritsema and Smeekens, 2003a;ChalmersNone., 2005;AltenbachNone., 2009;Van den EndeNone., 2009). Plant fructosyltransferases have been extensively researched, including characterization of the 3D structure ofPachysandra terminalisfructosyltransferase (LammensNone., 2012). In wheat and barley, three enzyme families that synthesize graminan-type fructans consisting of beta-2,6 linked fructosyl units with beta-2,1 branches are sucrose:sucrose 1-fructosyltransferase (1-SST), sucrose:fructan 6-fructosyltransferase (6-SFT), and fructan:fructan 1-fructosyltransferase (1-FFT) (LuscherNone., 1996;MullerNone., 2000;Kawakami and Yoshida, 2002,2005;Ritsema and Smeekens, 2003b). Fructans are accumulated when the production of photoassimilates exceeds the need (Pollock, 1984). In wheat, stems are the major storage sites of fructans (RuuskaNone., 2008). Fructans are the major component of water-soluble carbohydrates (WSCs) in the fructan accumulation phase in wheat stems (RuuskaNone., 2006). WSCs in the stem in the peak accumulation phase, which are mainly fructans, can account for over 40% of the stem dry weight (BlacklowNone., 1984) and are important carbon reserve for grain filling in temperate cereals. The contribution of stored WSCs to grain filling ranges from 20 to 45%, depending on the incorporation of respiration and other carbon sinks (AustinNone., 1977;Bonnett and Incoll, 1992,1993;van HerwaardenNone., 1998a;Wardlaw and Willenbrink, 2000). WSCs in stems become even more important under drought stress conditions where the contribution of stem reserves to grain yield increases significantly (Aggarwal and Sinha, 1984;van HerwaardenNone., 1998b). Positive association of stem WSC concentration with grain weight or yield in wheat has been observed in many studies, particularly under water-limited environments (FoulkesNone., 2002;Asseng and van Herwaarden, 2003;XueNone., 2008b,2009;McIntyreNone., 2011,2012). This positive association is mainly attributed to the fructan component of the stem WSCs. Besides being important for temporary carbon storage, fructans have also been reported to protect cells from drought and cold stress. Pilon-SmitsNone. (1995)have shown improvement of drought tolerance of transgenic tobacco plants that express a bacterial fructosyltransferase, andKawakamiNone. (2008)have found the increased cold tolerance of rice plants expressing1-SSTor6-SFTfrom wheat. This increased tolerance is likely due to their stabilizing effect on the membranes of the stressed cells and serving as an antioxidant (DemelNone., 1998;HinchaNone., 2000;KawakamiNone., 2008;Valluru and Van den Ende, 2008,2009;LivingstonNone., 2009;Bolouri-MoghaddamNone., 2010). The coding sequences of many fructosyltransferases have been isolated from various plant species. SprengerNone. (1995)reported the isolation of the6-SFTcDNA from barley, followed by the publication of many other fructosyltransferases from different species (de Halleux and Cutsem, 1997;HellwegeNone., 1997;VijnNone., 1997,1998;Van der MeerNone., 1998;Van den EndeNone., 2000,2006;Kawakami and Yoshida, 2002,2005;LasseurNone., 2006,2011). Enzyme activities and the expression of the genes encoding these enzymes have been shown to be regulated by various signals. For example, sucrose, besides being a substrate for the fructan synthesis, has been suggested as a signalling molecule that is able to upregulate the expression of genes in the fructan synthetic pathway (WagnerNone., 1986;MullerNone., 2000;KorolevaNone., 2001;Martinez-NoelNone., 2001,2009,2010;NagarajNone., 2001,2004;LuNone., 2002;RuuskaNone., 2008,RitsemaNone., 2009;XueNone., 2011a,2013). Other factors that play an important role in the fructan synthetic pathway are protein kinases and phosphatases (Martinez-NoelNone., 2001,2009,2010;KuschNone., 2009;RitsemaNone., 2009). Despite many studies on fructans and genes involved in fructan synthesis and regulation, regulatory pathways involving transcription factors, protein kinases, and phosphatases are largely unknown. Recently, one transcription factor has been identified to be potentially involved in the regulation ofTa1-SSTandTa6-SFTgenes. XueNone. (2011a)have shown three highly homologous R2R3 MYB transcription factor genes (TaMYB13-1,TaMYB13-2, andTaMYB13-3) that are closely co-regulated withTa1-SSTandTa6-SFTgenes in wheat, andTaMYB13-1is a predominantly expressed gene among these three. The expression ofTaMYB13-1is upregulated by sucrose and during stem development. The activation of the expression ofTa1-SSTandTa6-SFTpromoter-driven reporter genes byTaMYB13-1has been demonstrated in transient transactivation assays. To gain further insight into the role of TaMYB13-1 in the fructan synthetic pathway in wheat, this work characterized transgenic wheat overexpressingTaMYB13-1. Expression analysis ofTaMYB13-1-overexpressing lines using Affymetrix wheat genome array and quantitative reverse-transcription PCR revealed that TaMYB13-1 upregulated the expression of not onlyTa1-SSTandTa6-SFTbut alsoTa1-FFTfamily genes and other genes associated with fructan accumulation (e.g. fructokinase 1(FK1) andgamma-vacuolar processing enzyme 1(gamma-VPE1)). TaMYB13 DNA-binding motifs were also found in the promoter regions of theTa1-FFT1andTagamma-VPE1genes and verified within vitroDNA-binding assays. These two new target genes identified in this study showed positive correlation withTaMYB13-1expression in all datasets analysed. The transgenic plants had higher fructan and WSC levels as well as higher spike weight and grain weight per spike in comparison with wild-type control plants, demonstrating that a TaMYB13-1-mediated regulon plays an important role in modulating fructan accumulation and conferring the high fructan trait. Spring wheat (Triticum aestivumcv. Bobwhite SH 98 26) was grown in a controlled environment room in 1.5-l pots containing a mixture of sand:soil:peat (3/1/1). The room had the following day/night settings: 16/8 light/dark (500 mumol m-2s-1), 20/16 degrees C and 60/80% relative humidity (KamNone., 2008). Two organs selected for gene expression and WSC analyses are flag leaf (an important organ of photosynthesis for contributing to wheat grain yield) and stem (a major organ for fructan storage). As the top internode (peduncle) of the stem contains a much more abundant amount of RNA than the lower internodes, only top internode samples were used for main analyses in this study. To minimize diurnal fluctuations of gene expression samples were harvested 6-7h after the lights turned on. Harvested samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately and stored at -80 degrees C.For evaluation of yield-related phenotypes under mild drought conditions, plants were grown in 14.3-l pots with a 29-cm top diameter. Each pot grew six plants, which mimics plants grown in a small plot. The plants were watered only when they showed mild water-deficit stress. Samples were ground in liquid nitrogen using mortar and pestle. RNA was isolated using Plant RNA Reagent from Invitrogen according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA was removed as described byXue and Loveridge (2004)and the isolated RNA was purified using the RNeasy Plant mini-kit column (Qiagen), following the directions of the kit. For quantitative reverse-transcription PCR, 5 mug total RNA was retro-transcribed using Superscript III first strand synthesis kit from Invitrogen, according the manufacturer's instruction. Relative transcript levels of genes were determined from cDNA with an ABI Prism 7900 sequence detection system using SYBR Green PCR Master mix (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR amplification efficiencies of gene-specific primers were determined by serial cDNA dilutions. Relative gene expression levels were calculated as described byShawNone. (2009), where the relative mRNA value of each gene in a given sample is estimated using the mean of two normalized values against that of two internal control genes,TaRPII36, RNA-polymerase II 36 kD subunit (XueNone., 2006) andTaRP15, RNA polymerases I, II, and III 15 kD subunit (XueNone., 2008b). Primers used for the amplification ofTa1-SST1,Ta1-SST2,Ta6-SFT1,Ta6-SFT2,Ta1-FFT1,Ta1-FFT2,TaRP15, andTaRPII36were as published byXueNone. (2008a,b,2011a). The following real-time PCR primer pairs were used for the quantification ofTagamma-VPE1andTaFK1mRNA levels: 5'-CGAGCTGATTGGAAACCTTCT-3' (forward) and 5'-AGCGAGCCACATTGTGATTCAA-3' (reverse) forTagamma-VPE1; 5'-TCTTGGAGATCAAGGATGCAAGT-3' (forward) and 5'-CACCAGCACCTGTCGTATCAAC-3' (reverse) forTaFK1. TaMYB13-1expression construct (Hv6-SFT:TaMYB13-1:rice rbcS 3') was made by inserting the coding region ofTaMYB13-1after the barleyHv6-SFTpromoter (NagarajNone., 2001), using expression construct plasmids in the cloning vector pSP72 as described byXiao and Xue (2001)andXueNone. (2003), followed by nucleotide sequencing. The selectable marker cassette containing rice act1:bar:nos 3' was used to co-transform Bobwhite wheat plants. Both cassettes were PCR amplified and used for transformation of immature Bobwhite SH 98 26 embryos using the particle bombardment as described byPellegrineschiNone. (2002). Transgenic plants were selected with the herbicide phosphinothricin and grown in a controlled environmental growth room as described above. The presence of the Hv6-SFT:TaMYB13-1:rice rbcS 3' cassette was verified by real-time PCR using genomic DNA as described previously (XueNone., 2011b). The flag leaf and top internode samples were harvested from plants at anthesis grown in controlled environment as described above. The WSC levels were measured using the modified anthrone procedure (XueNone., 2009). The levels of sugars (sucrose, glucose, and fructose) were determined using HPLC (Waters, Massachusetts, USA) and separated on an analytical column (CarboPac PA-100; Dionex, California, USA) using 50-150mM NaOH as a mobile phase. The fructan fraction of the WSC extracts was analysed by HPLC measurement of the glucose and fructose levels of the WSC extracts before and after mild acid hydrolysis of fructans. The mild acid hydrolysis of fructans was performed according to the method ofVan den EndeNone. (2003). For TLC analysis, approximately 80 mug WSCs per lane were loaded on 20cm * 20cm silica-gel-coated plates (0.2mm thick, TLC Silica gel 60 F254, Merck). The TLC was run as described byIncollNone. (1989)with 1-propanol:ethyl-ethanoate:water (5/3/2, v/v/v). Sugars and fructans separated on TLC plates were visualized by spraying the plates with urea-phosphoric acid and heating at 110 degrees C (WiseNone., 1955). WSCs extracted fromHelianthus tuberosuswere used as markers for fructans. RNA from the flag leaves of plants at anthesis grown in controlled environment was extracted and processed as described above. RNA quality check, cRNA preparation, labelling, hybridization, and data acquisition of Affymetrix Wheat GeneChips were performed by the microarray service at the Australian Genome Research Facility (Melbourne, Australia). The Affymetrix GeneChip data were normalized using GeneChip robust multiarray average, developed byWuNone. (2004), using the Affymetrix package within Bioconductor, running within the R statistical programming environment (www.r-project.org). The dataset (the accession number GSE42000) was deposited at the NCBI (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo). Probesets with expression levels below 100 in both the control and transgenic groups were discarded, so were probesets that had a differential expression value with aP-value greater than 0.05. The sequences of the Affymetrix probes for the target genes were used as query sequences toblastthe genomic sequence of wheat from CerealsDB (WilkinsonNone., 2012). The retrieved sequence was subsequently used in a newblastsearch to retrieve additional sequences. The final retrieved genomic sequence contigs were cross checked with EST data from NCBI (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) and the DFCITriticum aestivumGene Index (http://compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/tgi/gimain.pl?gudb=wheat). Theblastsearch was continued until at least 1000bp upstream of the ATG was obtained if it was possible. In vitroDNA-binding assays using cellulase D (CELD) as a reporter were performed as described byXue (2002), using streptavidin-coated 96-well plate and binding/washing buffer (25mM HEPES/KOH pH 7.0, 50mM KCl, 0.2mM EDTA, and 0.5mM DTT) containing 0.15 mug mul-1shared herring sperm DNA, 0.3mg ml-1bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol, and 0.025% Nonidet P-40. For each assay, 40 000 fluorescent units h-1of the CELD activity of TaMYB13-1-CELD protein and 2 pmol of biotinylated probes were used. The cellulase activity of TaMYB13-1-CELD proteins bound to immobilized biotinylated probes was assayed by incubation in 100 mul of the CELD substrate solution (1mM methylumbelliferyl beta-d-cellobioside in 50mM Na-citrate buffer, pH 6.0) at 40 degrees C for 3h. A biotin-labelled double-stranded oligonucleotide without a TaMYB13-1-binding site was used as a control of background activity. For the synthesis of the biotin-labelled probes, oligonucleotides were designed around the predicted TaMYB13-1 DNA-binding sites present in the genomic sequence as described above, including 10bp upstream and downstream these sites. The oligonucleotides were manufactured by Geneworks (Adelaide, Australia). The biotinylated double-stranded oligonucleotides were synthesized as described byXue (2005). To gain a better insight into the target genes of TaMYB13-1, this work expressed the coding sequence of theTaMYB13-1cDNA derived from correctly spliced mRNA under the control of the6-SFTpromoter from barley (Hv6-SFT) and ricerbcS3' region (Fig. 1A) in wheat, asHv6-SFTis a well-studied fructosyltransferase gene and is expected to be expressed in organs where fructan accumulation normally occurs. The presence ofTaMYB13-1in T0transgenic wheat plants was verified by genomic quantitative PCR (data not shown), using primers that amplify the 3'-untranslated region of ricerbcS(XueNone., 2011b). In the T1generation, expression ofTaMYB13-1transgene was confirmed in the mature leaves of transgenic plants using quantitative reverse-transcription PCR and ricerbcS3' region primers (data not shown). The T2plants of five independentTaMYB13-1transgene expressing lines (a20, a21, b2, b13, and b36) were analysed for the expression level ofTaMYB13-1in the flag leaves at anthesis. The primers used amplified both the correctly spliced endogenousTaMYB13-1as well as the transgeneTaMYB13-1. The expression levels ofTaMYB13-1in the flag leaves of transgenic plants at anthesis ranged from 3- (a21) to 9-times (b36) higher than that of wild-type control plants (Bobwhite). Subsequently, the flag leaf and top internode samples of plants in the fructan accumulation phase (at anthesis) were selected for comparative analysis of expression levels. The average increases in the expression levels ofTaMYB13-1in the flag leaf and top internode (peduncle) of transgenic plants at anthesis, in comparison with wild-type control plants, are shown inFig. 1BandC. Expression levels ofTaMYB13-1and its target genes inTaMYB13-1transgenic lines and Bobwhite (BW) control plants. (A)TaMYB13-1expression cassette.

(D, E) Expression correlation betweenTaMYB13-1and its putative target genes in the flag leaf (D) and top internode (E); the expression level in each sample is relative to the mean expression value in the Bobwhite control group, which was set at 1. *P less than 0.05; **P less than 0.01. Transgenic lines were analysed to examine changes in the expression levels ofTaMYB13-1target genes. Since the expression levels of many genes might be affected by the upregulation of a transcription factor, this work used the Affymetrix Wheat GeneChip to study the expression of the wheat transcriptome, comparing the three transgenic lines (a20, b2, and b36) containing the highestTaMYB13-1expression with three wild-type control plants. The flag leaf samples were used for Affymetrix array analysis because it was thought that overexpression ofTaMYB13-1might also affect the expression levels of genes related to the sucrose synthetic pathway in the leaf. From the generated dataset, genes were selected with expression levels notably increased or decreased (factor 2;P less than 0.05). Thirty-two probesets (27 genes) had an increased expression level in the transgenic lines compared to the control plants (Table 1), whereas 18 probesets (18 genes) had a lower expression level (Supplementary Table S1, available atJXBonline). This study decided to focus on the upregulated genes, since this would more likely result in the identification of direct targets of TaMYB13-1. Genes increased in expression levels by at least 2-fold inTaMYB13-1-overexpressing transgenic lines compared to Bobwhite control plants in Affymetrix wheat genome array dataValues are expression ratio (EXPR) of the mean of three independent transgenic lines to the mean of three biological replicates of Bobwhite. As expected, the hybridization signal of the Ta.12834.1.S1_s_at probeset, which can hybridize three highly homologousTaMYB13genes (TaMYB13-1,TaMYB13-2, andTaMYB13-3) in both correctly and wrongly spliced forms (XueNone., 2011a) as well as theHv6-SFTpromoter-drivenTaMYB13-1transgene, was higher in the transgenic lines than control plants (Table 1). Strikingly, the Ta.24195.1.A1_at probeset (an unknown-function gene) had a 17-fold increase in expression in the transgenic lines compared to the control plants. Among the upregulated genes with known function, the only pathway that is overrepresented was the one related to fructan synthesis. Of 32 upregulated probesets, 10 are related to the sucrose (Ta.10107.2.S1_a_at, Ta.10107.2.S1_x_at, and Ta.10107.1.S1_at) and fructan (Ta.3475.2.S1_at, Ta.3475.1.A1_at, Ta.27 88.1.A1_at, Ta.2789.1.S1_a_at, Ta.2789.2.S1_x_at, Ta.2789.2. S1_at, and Ta.2789.1.S1_at) synthetic pathways. Among these 10 probesets, five belong toTa1-SSTandTa6-SFT, which can be transactivated by TaMYB13-1, as shown in the previous study (XueNone., 2011a). Interestingly,Ta1-FFT1andTa1-FFT2, represented by the probeset Ta.3475.2.S1_at, had an increased hybridization signal in transgenic lines, which was greater than 5-times higher than non-transformed Bobwhite control plants (Table 1). A similar increase in the signal of theTa1-FFT2-specific probeset was observed. These data indicate that TaMYB13-1 has an impact on the expression of all three families of fructosyltransferases in wheat. Besides fructosyltransferases, other upregulated genes relevant to the fructan synthesis were a fructokinase gene (TaFK1) represented by three probesets and agamma-vacuolar processing enzymegene(Tagamma-VPE1). To validate the upregulation of these genes, their expression levels were measured by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR in both the flag leaf and top internode. As shown inFig. 1B, the upregulation of all genes was observed in the flag leaf, although the marked increases in theTa6-SFT2andTa1-FFT2mRNA levels were not statistically significant due to the large variation in expression among individual transgenic lines (a20, b2, b13, and b36). Therefore, this work tested the correlation in expression betweenTaMYB13-1and its upregulated genes. The expression correlations betweenTaMYB13-1and these tested genes in the flag leaf were all statistically significant (Fig. 1D). Similar results were obtained in the top internode, where the expression levels of all these tested genes were significantly increased in the five transgenic lines and were significantly correlated with theTaMYB13-1mRNA level, except forTa1-FFT2andTaFK1(Fig. 1CandE). Because fructosyltransferase proteins are located in the vacuole and because plant mature fructosyltransferases generally consist of two subunits derived from proteolytic cleavage of their pre-proteins except the 1-FFT fromHelianthus tuberosus(Koops and Jonker, 1994,1996;SprengerNone., 1995;Van den EndeNone., 1996,2000), it was suspected that the TaMYB13-1-upregulated vacuolar processingTagamma-VPE1might be a candidate for processing the maturation of fructosyltransferase proteins. Therefore, this work examined whetherTagamma-VPE1and fructosyltransferase genes were closely co-regulated in the expression datasets. Correlation analysis showed that theTagamma-VPE1mRNA levels were highly correlated with these fructosyltransferase mRNA levels in the stem of recombinant inbred lines with contrasting fructan levels, during stem development and among samples of transgenic and control plants (Supplementary Fig. S1). The expression data clearly points to the fructan synthesis pathway as a target for TaMYB13-1 regulation. It is known that a good correlation exists betweenTa1-SSTmRNA levels and its enzyme activity levels in wheat (XueNone., 2008b), as well asHv6-SFTmRNA levels and its enzyme activity levels in barley (SprengerNone., 1995). Since genes fromTa1-SSTandTa6-SFTfamilies, together withTa1-FFTfamily genes, were highly upregulated in the transgenic lines, the fructan and WSC concentrations in these transgenic lines were compared with wild-type control plants. As can be seen inFig. 2A, the fructan levels in the top internode as well as the flag leaf were higher in all of the four transgenic lines than in the control plants. The increase in fructan levels in the flag leaf and top internode of the transgenic group was statistically significant in comparison with the wild-type control group (Fig. 2B). There was also a slight increase in the sucrose level in the top internode of transgenic lines, but not in the leaf (see TLC analysis inFig. 3). Correlation analysis showed highly significant positive relationships betweenTaMYB13-1mRNA levels and fructan levels in the flag leaf and top internode in the dataset of these transgenic and control plants (Fig. 2CandD). Also, the WSC concentrations in the flag leaf and top internode were increased by 36 and 17%, respectively (P less than 0.05;Table 2). The increase of WSC concentration in the flag leaf and top internode in the transgenic plants compared to control plants corresponds almost exclusively to the increased portion of fructan accumulation (about 6mg (g freshweight)-1,Fig. 2B). TLC analysis clearly illustrates an increase in the levels of fructans with various polymerization degrees in the transgenic lines compared to control plants (Fig. 3). The difference is especially clear in the top internode samples at anthesis, where the fructans in the control plants were barely visible, whereas the transgenic plants accumulated a significant amount of fructans.

As the TaMYB13-1-upregulated genes in its overexpressing transgenic plants can be direct or indirect target genes, this work investigated whether TaMYB13-1-binding sites were present in their promoter sequences as a supporting line of evidence for directly targeted genes. In the case ofTa1-SSTandTa6-SFT,XueNone. (2011a)have shown that TaMYB13-binding sites are present in the regulatory regions of these genes. The wheat genome sequence database in the CerealsDB website (WilkinsonNone., 2012) was used to identify the regulatory regions of the genes that were upregulated in the transgenic lines. The obtained sequences and probable gene structures were assembled from accessions, as displayed inSupplementary Table S2. This work was able to identify the regulatory regions of 11 genes (Table 3), in addition to the regulatory regions ofTa1-SST,Ta1-FFT1,Ta6-SFT1, andTa6-SFT2, which were published previously (NagarajNone., 2001;GaoNone., 2010;XueNone., 2011a). The length of the upstream regulatory regions identified ranged from 0.6 to 2kb (Table 3). Most of these newly identified genes contained at least one core TaMYB13 DNA-binding sequence motif (DTTHGGT;XueNone., 2011a) in their upstream regulatory regions. In addition to the presence of TaMYB13-binding motifs in the promoter regions ofTa1-SST,Ta6-SFT1, andTa6-SFT2(XueNone., 2011a),Ta1-FFT1contained three predicted TaMYB13-binding motifs in its upstream regulatory region andTagamma-VPE1had two predicted motifs. TaMYB13 DNA-binding motifs found in the regulatory regions of TaMYB13-1 target genesSeq Length is the length of the upstream regulatory region sequence that this study was able to identify. MBS URS displays the number of predicted TaMYB13 DNA-binding motifs found in the upstream regulatory region and MBS Intron displays the number of predicted TaMYB13 DNA-binding motifs in introns. Accessions of sequences assembled from sequence data in CerealsDB can be found inSupplemental Table S2. Several genes are known to be regulated by sequences that are present in their introns, for exampleAGAMOUSandSEEDSTICK(Deyholos and Sieburth, 2000;KooikerNone., 2005). Therefore, this work searched for TaMYB13 DNA-binding motifs in the introns of the identified genes as well. As shown inTable 3, at least one binding site was present in the introns of nine of the analysed genes and three of them (TaFK1,Tagamma-VPE1, and amino acid permease) even had four or more of these motifs in their introns. XueNone. (2011a)have shown that flanking regions play an important role in the determination of the binding affinity of TaMYB13-1. Therefore, CELD reporter-basedin vitroDNA-binding assays were performed to determine the affinity of TaMYB13-1 to the identified motifs in the upstream regulatory regions of the following upregulated genes:Ta1-FFT1(one site),TaMYB13-1(one site), TaMYB13-2(one site),TaMYB13-3(one site),TaH2B(one site), andTagamma-VPE1(two sites) (Fig. 4) and oligonucleotides 10bp upstream and downstream of the core sequence of TaMYB13 DNA-binding motif were designed. As shown inFig. 4, TaMYB13-1 bound strongly to the motifs present in the upstream regulatory regions ofTa1-FFT1 and Tagamma-VPE1. The strongest interaction was the motif present in the promoter ofTagamma-VPE1site 1 at -969 (Fig. 4B), which was bound by TaMYB13-1 even stronger than SynO2, anin vitroTaMYB13-selected binding sequence (XueNone., 2011a), which was used as a positive control. In addition, TaMYB13-1 was also able to bind weakly to the motifs present in the upstream regulatory regions ofTaMYB13-1,TaMYB13-2andTaMYB13-3(Fig. 4C). No binding activity of TaMYB13-1 for the motif present in the H2B promoter region was found (Fig. 4C).

Displayed values are means +/- SD of three replicates. Control is an oligo that does not contain TaMYB13-1-binding motifs; SynO2 was used as a positive control. *P less than 0.05; **P less than 0.01; n.s., not significant. Because the expression of a positive regulator and its target genes is generally correlated, this work examined the relationship between the expression levels ofTaMYB13-1and the new target genes identified in this study (Ta1-FFT1andTagamma-VPE1) in developing stems (5 days before anthesis to 10 days after anthesis). Similarly toTaMYB13-1, bothTa1-FFT1andTagamma-VPE1transcript levels were markedly upregulated in the top internode (peduncle) at the stem developmental period examined (data not shown). High correlations were observed between the expression levels ofTaMYB13-1and its target genesTagamma-VPE1andTa1-FFT1(Fig. 5AandB). These high expression correlations are similar to those seen betweenTaMYB13-1andTa1-SSTorTa6-SFTgenes (XueNone., 2011a).

(C, D) Expression correlation in the stems of recombinant inbred lines from Affymterix wheat genome array GSE9767 data, deposited at the NCBI GEO website byXueNone. (2008b). The probesets used for analysis are: Ta.30798.3.S1_at (Tagamma-VPE1), Ta.3475.2.S1_at (Ta1-FFT1andTa1-FFT2), and Ta.12834.1.S1_s_at (TaMYB13-1, TaMYB13-2andTaMYB13-3). Values are Affymetrix array hybridization signals. To further investigate the expression correlation betweenTaMYB13-1andTa1-FFT1orTagamma-VPE1, the Affymterix wheat genome array GSE9767 data, deposited at the NCBI GEO website byXueNone. (2008b)was analysed using eight independent recombinant inbred lines with two field replicates per line (16 samples) to investigate their relationships. High correlations were found between the hybridization signal levels of theTaMYB13probeset and the targetsTagamma-VPE1orTa1-FFT(Fig. 5CandD). WSC levels in wheat are known to be positively associated with grain yield under terminal drought conditions (Aggarwal and Sinha, 1984;van HerwaardenNone., 1998b;XueNone., 2008b). Therefore, this work examined the yield-related phenotypes of transgenic plants at T5generation grown under mild water-deficit conditions in comparison with Bobwhite control plants. As shown inTable 4, the transgenic lines (a20, a21, and b2) had increased values for all measured traits, although not all increases were statistically significant. The most prominent increase was observed in the total grain weight per plant, but this increase was not statistically significant (P= 0.09). Significant increases were observed for the top spike weight, average spike weight, and grain weight per spike. Yield-related phenotypes ofTaMYB13-1-overexpressing transgenic wheatValues shown are means +/- SD (n= 3). Pots of 14.3-l capacity with a 29-cm top diameter were used for growing transgenic plants (three pots) and wild-type Bobwhite (three pots). Each pot grew six plants. The plants were grown under a mild water-deficit regime. Individual phenotypic data derived from each pot were used for calculation of the mean values of each group. ForTaMYB13-1transgenic lines, mean values are derived from three independent transgenic lines (a20, a21, and b2) at the T5stage. Investigation of regulatory networks involved in controlling fructan synthesis associated genes, which include fructosyltransferases and their modification and processing enzymes, in plants is an important topic of research. It will lead to understand the regulatory pathways of fructan synthesis and the critical genes associated with the high fructan accumulation trait in temperate cereals, as well as to facilitate future genetic manipulation of fructan accumulation for human health benefit of higher fructan plant products (Roberfroid, 2007) and potential improvement of crop yield in abiotic stress-prone environments. TaMYB13-1 has been shown to be a transcriptional activator ofTa1-SSTandTa6-SFTin wheat using a transient transactivation system. This study showed that overexpression ofTaMYB13-1in transgenic wheat resulted not only in increased expression levels of the genes directly involved in or associated with fructan synthesis, but also in increased fructan and WSC concentrations in transgenic wheat lines, thus demonstrating that TaMYB13-1 mediates the coordinated regulation of a major set of genes involved in fructan synthesis. Affymetrix array expression analysis revealed that 27 genes were upregulated at least 2-fold in the leaves ofTaMYB13-1-overexpressing transgenic lines compared to Bobwhite control plants. AllTa1-SSTandTa6-SFTgenes represented by the probesets in the Affymetrix wheat genome array (Ta1-SST2,Ta6-SFT1, andTa6-SFT2) were found to be upregulated in the transgenic lines, which supports the proposed TaMYB13-1 regulatory role based on the transient transactivation data (XueNone., 2011a). Most interestingly, two probesets that belong toTa1-FFTgenes, the third family of fructosyltransferases, were also upregulated inTaMYB13-1-overexpressing lines. This is one of the novel TaMYB13-1 target genes identified in this study, as the regulation of this family of fructosyltransferases by TaMYB13-1 was not investigated in the previous study (XueNone., 2011a). Correlation analysis also showed that the expression levels of these three families of fructosyltransferase genes (Ta1-SST,Ta6-SFT, andTa1-FFT) were highly correlated withTaMYB13-1expression among the sample set of transgenic lines and Bobwhite control plants, as well as among samples obtained from various stem developmental stages (XueNone., 2011a; this study). It has been shown that the expression profiles ofTa1-SSTandTa6-SFTgenes are positively correlated with that ofTaMYB13-1in recombinant inbred lines (XueNone., 2011a). Correlation analysis of the Affymetrix data previously deposited byXueNone. (2008b)showed that the expression of theTa1-FFTprobeset (Ta.3475.2.S1_at, which hybridizes with bothTa1-FFT1andTa1-FFT2) was also positively correlated with that of theTaMYB13probeset in the stem of recombinant inbred SB lines. The correlation coefficients betweenTaMYB13-1andTa1-FFT1in the flag leaf and stem in the datasets of the transgenic and control plants were very high. This high correlation was also observed during stem development. The fact that there were very high expression correlations betweenTaMYB13-1andTa1-FFT1in various genetic backgrounds as well as during stem development makes it likely thatTa1-FFT1is also a direct target of TaMYB13-1. To further support this, TaMYB13-1 was able to bind strongly to a motif present in the upstream regulatory region ofTa1-FFT1inin vitroDNA-binding assays. In addition to genes that are directly involved in the fructan synthetic pathway, two genes (Tagamma-VPE1andTaFK1) were found to be upregulated in the leaf ofTaMYB13-1-overexpressing lines and could be linked indirectly to this pathway. TaFK1was upregulated about 2.4-times in the leaves of transgenic lines, indicating a role of TaMYB13-1 in the regulation of the fructose metabolism. Fructokinases (EC 2.7.1.4) catalyse the conversion of fructose tod-fructose-6-phosphate and have been shown to be induced upon the external application of fructose, glucose, and sucrose in tomato (Schaffer and Petreikov, 1997). DaviesNone. (2005)have shown that in potato fructokinases are able to balance sucrose synthesis and metabolism in concert with sucrose synthase, which converts sucrose into fructose and UDP-d-glucose. Free fructose can also come from sucrose hydrolysis by invertase as well as from fructan exohydrolase trimming of fructans as a part of the fructan synthesis process (BancalNone., 1992;Van den EndeNone., 2003;LothierNone., 2007). The increased demand for sucrose in the cells that express the elevated levels of fructosyltransferases might be partly offset by the increase in fructokinase, since the product of this enzyme,d-fructose-6-phosphate, is a substrate for sucrose-phosphate synthase. Therefore, an increase in fructokinase would favour carbon flow towards fructan accumulation. However, it is unclear if this regulation is direct or indirect, since this work was not able to find any TaMYB13-binding motifs in the upstream regulatory region of this gene. However, there were three TaMYB13-binding motifs present in the first intron of this gene, so the direct regulation of this gene by TaMYB13-1 cannot be excluded. The expression ofTaMYB13-1andTaFK1in the leaf correlates significantly in the dataset of the transgenic versus control plants, but was not statistically significant in the stem, which indicates that the expression ofTaFK1in the stem might be regulated predominantly by other transcription factors. The other TaMYB13-1-upregulated gene that might be indirectly linked to the fructan synthesis isTagamma-VPE1, which may be involved in processing vacuolar fructosyltransferase proteins. VPE proteins are vacuolar cysteine proteases, known to cleave natural substrates in plants after asparagine residues and involved in processing the maturation or degradation of many vacuolar proteins (YamadaNone., 2005;TsiatsianiNone., 2012). Known natural substrates of plant VPEs include storage proteins, vacuolar invertase, and carboxypeptidase Y (Hara-NishimuraNone., 1991;ShimadaNone., 2003;TsiatsianiNone., 2012). InArabidopsis, four VPEs have been identified that are partially redundant in storage protein cleavage (GruisNone., 2004). Some VPEs have also been reported to play a role in programmed cell death (HayashiNone., 2001;RojoNone., 2004;Hara-Nishimura and Hatsugai, 2011). Several groups have shown that fructosyltransferasesin plantagenerally consist of two subunits generated from the cleavage of fructosyltransferase pre-proteins (SprengerNone., 1995;Koops and Jonker, 1996;Van den EndeNone., 1996,2000). SprengerNone. (1995)reported that the cleavage of barley 6-SFT (Hv6-SFT) occurs between Asn and an EAD triplet. This cleavage site fits into the substrate specificity of VPEs. Wheat Ta1-SST and Ta6-SFT pre-proteins contain the cleavage site of NEAD, whereas Ta1-FFT pre-proteins have a similar site: NEVD. From the recent review on the natural substrates of plant proteases (TsiatsianiNone., 2012), it appears that only VPEs cleave the Asn-other amino acid residue bond in natural substrates known to date. Although the uncleaved version of a number of recombinant fructosyltransferases expressed inPichia pastorisis functional (LuscherNone., 2000;AltenbachNone., 2004;Van den EndeNone., 2006,2011;LasseurNone., 2011), some plant fructosyltransferases expressed in the yeast showed almost undetectable activities (HisanoNone., 2008;LasseurNone., 2011). It is likely that this cleavage is necessary for increase in activityin plantaor stability of fructosyltransferase proteins in the vacuole. Analysis of the Affymetrix data of recombinant inbred lines showed that the expression ofTagamma-VPE1was highly correlated with the expression ofTaMYB13-1in recombinant inbred lines. Significant correlation was observed in the developing stem samples and in the transgenic/control plant datasets. Interestingly, the upstream regulatory region of this gene contains two motifs and one of them was bound very strongly by TaMYB13-1 inin vitroDNA-binding assays, indicating that this gene is likely to be directly regulated by TaMYB13-1. Close expression correlations were found betweenTagamma-VPE1and fructosyltransferase genes in the stem in all expression datasets. Close co-regulation ofTagamma-VPE1with fructosyltransferase genes within the TaMYB13-1 regulatory network together with the cleavage sites of fructosyltransferases fitting into the substrate specificity of Tagamma-VPE1 point to the potential involvement of Tagamma-VPE1 in processing the maturation of fructosyltransferases in the vacuole in wheat. These findings will lead to a new exciting research topic on the potential role ofgamma-VPE1 in modulating fructan accumulation by its ability in potential enhancement of fructosyltransferase activity as discussed above. AlthoughTaMYB13-1is highly expressed in organs where fructans accumulate at high levels, it is also expressed in other organs where fructan synthetic activity is low, such as mature leaf. In particular, the highly homologous genes of TaMYB13 exist in non-fructan accumulating plant species such asArabidopsisand rice. For example, the TaMYB13 homologue inArabidopsis, AtMYB59, is involved in root growth and cell cycle (MuNone., 2009). Therefore, it is likely that TaMYB13-1 also plays a role in regulation of other processes. MuNone. (2009)published a list of upregulated genes in transgenicArabidopsisthat overexpressesAtMYB59. Although the promoters used for driving the expression ofAtMYB59andTaMYB13-1were different (cauliflower mosaic virus35Svs.Hv6-SFT) and the organ used in their study was also different from the organ used in this study (flag leaf vs. 12-day-old seedlings), this work was able to find nine genes that had an increased expression in both datasets (Supplementary Table S3). The upregulation of these common genes was relatively small, ranging from 1.21 to 2.42-times higher inTaMYB13-1-overexpressing lines than the control plants, but statistically significant (P less than 0.05). This work was also able to find multiple core TaMYB13 DNA-binding motifs in the upstream regulatory region and/or introns of all these common targets inArabidopsis(data not shown) except for At4g25630 and At5g60520. However, as the levels of the increase in the expression of most of these genes in theTaMYB13-1-overexpressing lines were low, it is likely that TaMYB13-1 plays only a minor role in the regulation of these genes. It is also interesting to see that TaMYB13-1 is able to bind to its own regulatory region, indicating a potential feedback loop, although its affinity to the motif was very low. Feedback loops have been reported previously for MYB transcription factors, such as CCA1 inArabidopsis(Wang and Tobin, 1998). It appears that an increase in the expression level of a single regulator has an impact on fructan and WSC accumulation. A significant increase in fructan and WSC concentrations was found in the leaf and top internode ofTaMYB13-1-overexpressing lines, compared to wild-type control plants. The increase of fructans in these two organs was 2.2-fold in the flag leaf, and 15.4-fold in the top internode. WSC levels in these organs were also significantly increased in the transgenic lines. This increase was largely attributed to the enhanced accumulation of the fructan component of the WSCs. These data are in line with results that there is a high correlation betweenTaMYB13-1expression levels and WSC or fructan levels in recombinant inbred lines (XueNone., 2011a). In fact, in the datasets of the transgenic lines and control plants, very high correlations were observed between the levels ofTaMYB13-1mRNA and WSC or fructan in both the flag leaf and the top internode. WSC levels and wheat yield under terminal drought conditions are known to be positively associated. The overexpression ofTaMYB13-1in transgenic plants resulted in an increase in spike weight and grain weight per spike under mild water-limited conditions. It is likely that the increased grain weight per spike in the transgenic plants is attributed to the enhanced accumulation of fructans in the stem, which supplies the increased amount of carbon reserve to the spike for grain filling. In addition, the grain weight per plant was increased by 13%, although the difference was not significant at theP-value level of 0.05. In view of that the contribution of the stored fructan to grain yield under terminal drought environments can also be attributed to the levels of fructan hydrolysis enzymes (fructan exohydrolases) during the fructan remobilization phase (JoudiNone., 2012), simultaneous manipulation of fructan exohydrolases may further improve grain yield through enhancing fructan remobilization. In summary, this study clearly demonstrates that TaMYB13-1 can act as a positive regulator for regulation of all three families of fructosyltransferase genes (includingTa1-FFT), which are directly involved in the fructan synthetic pathway in wheat. TaMYB13-1 regulates the fructan synthetic pathway by direct binding to the regulatory regions of fructosyltransferase genes. This TaMYB13-1 regulatory network is upregulated by sucrose and stem developmental signal (XueNone., 2011a), although besides sucrose what other factor is responsible for triggering fructan accumulation during stem development in wheat is still unclear. TaMYB13-1 is also involved in direct upregulation ofTagamma-VPE1through the binding to its promoter and Tagamma-VPE1 may be involved in processing the maturation of fructosyltransferases for enhancing their activities. The currently proposed regulatory model of TaMYB13-1 is illustrated inFig. 6. Together, these genes form a regulon for modulating fructan accumulation in the vacuole, which is mediated by the sucrose signalling pathway that involves protein kinases and phosphatases as previously reported (Martinez-NoelNone., 2001,2009;KuschNone., 2009;RitsemaNone., 2009). Whether involvement of these protein kinases and phosphatases in regulating the fructan synthesis is via the modification of TaMYB13-1 activity awaits future investigation, as the post-translational modification of transcription factors is a common mechanism in gene regulation, such as plant bZIP factors (SchutzeNone., 2008). It appears that overexpression ofTaMYB13-1in transgenic wheat is sufficient to increase fructan concentrations in the leaf and stem. However, further studies are required to see whether an increase in fructan accumulation through overexpression ofTaMYB13-1is able to improve grain yield in terminal abiotic stress environments in the field, such as drought and heat stress at the reproductive stage of wheat. Illustration of the proposed regulatory model of TaMYB13-1 for fructan synthesis in temperate cereals. The TaMYB13-binding sites inTa6-SFT1,Ta1-SST,Ta1-FFT1, andTagamma-VPE1promoters are indicated. The gamma-VPE protein might be involved in the maturation of fructosyltransferases in the vacuole by cleavage of the fructosyltransferase pre-proteins into two subunits (mature fructosyltransferases).
