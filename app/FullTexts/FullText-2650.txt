Proposed model ofNone-modulated lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced glia and pericyte activation. (a) Published data support that in astrocytes, toll-like receptor (TLR)4/LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory (PI) (tumor necrosis factor alpha,TNFalpha,IL-1beta,IL-6) secretion follows the pattern:None2 greater than = None3 greater than =None4,via differential NF-kappaB activation (Maezawaet al. 2006a), andCCL3 levels follow the pattern:None2 = None4 greater than None2(Cudabacket al. 2015). In microglia,LPS-induced p38alpha-dependent microglial secretion of PI cytokines (TNFalpha, nitric oxide,NO, IL-1beta, orIL-6) is higher withNone4compared toNone3(Maezawaet al. 2006c). Paracrine- and autocrine-like signaling will also impact the inflammatory response (gray arrows), e.g.,CCL3-dependent recruitment of microglia. Red box under glial diagram = overall PI effects for astrocytes and microglia, blue box = overall anti-inflammatory (AI) effects. (b) Apolipoprotein E (ApoE)3 and apoE2, but not apoE4 signal via low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) to suppress NF-kappaB-dependent secretion of matrix metalloproteinase 9. Thus,MMP9 levels are higher with apoE4, resulting in brain endothelial cell (BEC) dysfunction and blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown (Bellet al. 2012).

Proposed hypothesis ofNone-modulated Abeta-induced neuroinflammation. (a and b) Compared toNone3, withNone4: Lower lipoprotein lipidation and apolipoprotein E (apoE)4 levels result in lower apoE receptor signaling and levels, which with Abeta-induction amplifies detrimental and suppresses beneficial inflammatory receptor signaling. This imbalance leads to an adverse neuroinflammatory phenotype (NIP) and downstream neuronal dysfunction. ApoE signaling via the apoE receptors may suppress Abeta-induced activation of toll-like receptor (TLR)4-p38alpha signaling and potentiateIL-4R signaling through pathways that converge on nuclear receptor signaling.

Neuroinflammation from aberrantly activated glia is re-emerging as an important mechanism that contributes to AD progression (for review Akiyamaet al. 2000; Griffin Mrak2002; Eikelenboom van Gool2004; Van Eldiket al. 2007; Landreth2009; Tobinick2009; Viteket al. 2009; Bachstetter Van Eldik2010; Gorelick2010; Imbimboet al. 2010; Ferretti Cuello2011; Keeneet al. 2011; Sardiet al. 2011; Butchart Holmes2012; Rubio-Perez Morillas-Ruiz2012; Wyss-Coray Rogers2012; McGeer McGeer2013; Medeiros LaFerla2013; Meraz-Rioset al. 2013; Wilcock Griffin2013; Cherryet al. 2014; Nuzzoet al. 2014). The initial observations of activated microglia and astrocytes in pathologically relevant AD brain regions (Griffinet al. 1989), including within and surrounding amyloid plaques (Perlmutteret al. 1990; Edisonet al. 2008), are now complemented by recent genome-wide association studies and experimental data suggesting that several AD-genetic risk factors function through modulating neuroinflammation. Examples of such AD risk genes include triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) (Guerreiroet al. 2013; Jonssonet al. 2013), complement receptor 1 (CR1) (Brouwerset al. 2012), CD33 (Hollingworthet al. 2011; Najet al. 2011; Greenet al. 2014), and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) (Minorettiet al. 2006; Wanget al. 2011; Yuet al. 2012). However, it is important to note that data conflict on the role of CD33 and TLR4 on AD risk, highlighting the complexity of neuroinflammation in AD. Increased levels of the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta), including Abeta42, oligomeric (oAbeta), and Abeta present in amyloid plaques, are considered a major component of neuronal dysfunction in AD. In AD, glial activation may be independent of the Abeta peptide, via damaged cells (e.g., via damaged-associated molecular patterns) or other as yet unidentified factors (e.g., via pathogen-associated molecular patterns), and also Abeta dependent. Although knowledge of the mechanistic contribution of glial cells to disease progression remains incomplete, the overproduction of select detrimental inflammatory mediators and/or decreased levels of beneficial mediators is postulated as a driving force for cognitive impairment (Butchart Holmes2012). Identified functions modulated by neuroinflammation include: stem cell replication and differentiation; neuronal and glial metabolism; neuronal plasticity and toxicity; tau phosphorylation; axon myelination; blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability; extracellular matrix production/maintenance; and the removal of debris, foreign cells, and host-cells targeted for removal (de Vrieset al. 1996; de Vrieset al. 1997; Krishnaswamyet al. 1999; Reyeset al. 1999; Rosenberg2002; Vadeboncoeuret al. 2003; Perssonet al. 2005; Simardet al. 2006; Tilleux Hermans2007; Russoet al. 2011; Britschgiet al. 2012; Lazarov Marr2013). Therefore, it is critical to dissect the role of AD risk factors on Abeta-induced neuroinflammation. APOE4is the greatest genetic risk factor for sporadic AD, increasing risk approximately 12-fold with two copies of the epsilon4 allele compared toAPOE3, whereasAPOE2reduces risk twofold (Vergheseet al. 2011). Furthermore,APOE4carriers respond differently in clinical trials, often negatively (Farlowet al. 1998; Risneret al. 2006; Sperlinget al. 2012; Qiuet al. 2013). Although the impact of apolipoprotein E (apoE) on brain function is multifactorial, evidence indicates that the apoE isoforms differentially modulate neuroinflammation (Keeneet al. 2011). Indeed, epidemiological data indicate that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may lower AD risk, particularly forAPOE4carriers (Gorelick2010; Imbimboet al. 2010). While multiple lines of evidence demonstrate a heightened inflammatory response withAPOE4compared toAPOE3,surprisingly little data addressAPOEmodulation of Abeta-induced neuroinflammation. Thus, until theAPOE-specific neuroinflammatory phenotype (NIP) is defined and the underlying mechanistic pathways dissected, the development of therapeutics targeting AD-relevant, apoE-modulated neuroinflammatory pathways is limited. Investigations into the role of neuroinflammation in AD have raised important issues surrounding neuroinflammation-directed clinical trials, the type of Abeta that induces neuroinflammation, how to classify the functional NIP and how to target neuroinflammatory receptors. For virtually every inflammatory mediator in AD, reports conflict on the functional consequences of targeting these mediators, e.g., tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-4, and IL-10. (Bettoniet al. 2008; Leonet al. 2008; Shimizuet al. 2008; Ennaciri Girard2009; Songet al. 2011; Wanget al. 2011; Chakrabartyet al. 2012; Fennet al. 2012; Maet al. 2012; Peri Piazza2012; Opalet al. 2013). This issue is exemplified by data on the use of NSAIDs for the prevention of AD. Epidemiological data indicate that NSAIDs, which inhibit the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, lower the risk of developing AD, an effect greater forAPOE4(Gorelick2010; Imbimboet al. 2010). Therefore, the AD Anti-inflammatory Prevention Trial (ADAPT) was initiated (Martinet al. 2002; Meinertet al. 2009) with the goal of determining whether naproxen (non-selective) or celecoxib (COX2 selective) delayed the onset of dementia in individuals considered high risk for sporadic AD. Unfortunately, ADAPT was suspended after ~ 4 years (2001-2004) because of cardiovascular safety concerns identified in the Adenoma Prevention with Celecoxib trial (Solomonet al. 2005). While there are confounding factors with the ADAPT trial, including the short treatment duration (7 years planned vs. median duration of ~ 1.3 years), the relatively low AD incidence rate (2.5% predicted for year 1 vs. 1.12% for the entire trial as conducted), and age of enrollment ( greater than = 70), extensive follow-up data has been published on the ADAPT participants. Initial data demonstrated that neither NSAID prevented conversion to AD, or slowed cognitive decline (Lyketsoset al. 2007; Martinet al. 2008), including forAPOE4carriers (Drye Zandi2012), although some evidence indicated a decreased AD risk with naproxen (Breitneret al. 2011; Leoutsakoset al. 2012). However, the main conclusion from the ADAPT-Follow-up study (conducted for 7 years post trial) was that neither naproxen nor celecoxib prevent AD in adults with a family history of dementia (ADAPT-Research-Group2013, ADAPT-FS-Research-Group2014). In contrast, CHF5074, a novel flurbiprofen analog with no anti-COX activity, has recently been reported to improve executive function inAPOE4carriers with mild cognitive impairment (Rosset al. 2013). Therefore, identifying appropriate neuroinflammatory targets and pathways is an important focus of current research. An important consideration for interpreting functional data on Abeta-induced neuroinflammation in AD is the type of the peptide aggregate that induces neuroinflammation. While genetic and experimental evidence indicates that Abeta42 is necessary for AD pathology, it is difficult to identify the actual neurotoxic species, if there is, indeed, only one. These different forms include soluble Abeta (Lueet al. 1999; McLeanet al. 1999; Wanget al. 1999), oAbeta (Kuoet al. 1996; Tomicet al. 2009; Jinet al. 2011; Selkoe2011) and Abeta present in amyloid plaques (Klein2002; Thalet al. 2006; Haass Selkoe2007; Thalet al. 2008; Youmanset al. 2012). In addition, a dynamic compartmentalization between the different types of Abeta may exist, e.g., between plaques and soluble Abeta (Honget al. 2011; Hudryet al. 2013), and the different forms of Abeta may contribute to neurodegeneration at different stages of the disease (Lesneet al. 2013). Accumulating evidence over the last decade suggests that soluble Abeta42 (Lueet al. 1999; McLeanet al. 1999; Wanget al. 1999), specifically soluble oAbeta (Kuoet al. 1996; Tomicet al. 2009; Jinet al. 2011; Selkoe2011; Hayden Teplow2013; Teplow2013; Sebollelaet al. 2014), rather than insoluble Abeta (Hardy2006; Haass Selkoe2007) may be the proximal neurotoxin in AD. Although the exact stoichiometry of the oAbeta aggregates that are most active remains unclear (Hayden Teplow2013; Teplow2013; Sebollelaet al. 2014), oAbeta correlates with cognitive decline and disease severity in humans, and oAbeta levels are associated with memory decline in transgenic mice (Tg) expressing familial AD (FAD) mutations (FAD-Tg mice) (Kuoet al. 1996; Tomicet al. 2009; Jinet al. 2011; Selkoe2011; Hayden Teplow2013; Teplow2013; Sebollelaet al. 2014). In the context of neuroinflammation, compared to fibrillar assemblies, oAbeta preparations induce greater or differential pro-inflammatory cytokine production by microglia and astrocytesin vitro(Hashiokaet al. 2005; Lindberget al. 2005; Whiteet al. 2005; Parvathyet al. 2009; Sondaget al. 2009; Hayden Teplow2013). Indeed, our previous data in primary glia demonstrate that the oAbeta-induced increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine (nitric oxide, NO, TNFalpha, beta) secretion occurs earlier and is greater than with fibrillar assemblies of Abeta (Whiteet al. 2005). Thus, for different forms of Abeta (particularly oAbeta subtypes), identifying their levels at different stages of AD, the inflammatory response they produce, and their underlying mechanisms (e.g., receptor mediated) may provide critical information for therapeutic development. Although peripheral inflammation has been studied extensively over the last 20 years, studies of chronic neuroinflammatory responses in AD are less advanced (Cherryet al. 2014). As a simple model of peripheral inflammation, exogenous or endogenous molecules activate both innate and adaptive immunity to induce a pro-inflammatory response that can also activate and recruit additional immune cells to destroy/remove the initiator of the signal. Typically, there is also an anti-inflammatory/repair response to promote debris removal and restoration of the damaged area. However, the cell types, inflammatory mediators, and extent that this model translates to the brain in AD remain unclear. At the cellular level, neuroinflammation is a coordinated response among neurons, astrocytes, microglia, brain endothelial cells (BECs), oligodendrocytes, pericytes, ependymal cells, and peripheral immune cells recruited to the brain (Akiyamaet al. 2000; Griffin Mrak2002; Eikelenboom van Gool2004; Van Eldiket al. 2007; Landreth2009; Tobinick2009; Viteket al. 2009; Bachstetter Van Eldik2010; Gorelick2010; Imbimboet al. 2010; Ferretti Cuello2011; Keeneet al. 2011; Sardiet al. 2011; Butchart Holmes2012; Rubio-Perez Morillas-Ruiz2012; Wyss-Coray Rogers2012; McGeer McGeer2013; Medeiros LaFerla2013; Meraz-Rioset al. 2013; Wilcock Griffin2013; Cherryet al. 2014; Nuzzoet al. 2014; Prinz Priller2014). In AD, Abeta- and non-Abeta-induced activation of each cell type can produce an equally complex profile of cytokines and chemokines, which in turn produce a positive or negative feedback loop through autocrine- and paracrine-like signaling. Furthermore, with chronic neuroinflammation, the function of each inflammatory mediator and receptor can vary by cell type and at different stages of AD pathology. Within this milieu, identifying the effect of AD risk factors on the multiphasic expression of the NIP at different stages of AD pathology may ultimately address when and how to target neuroinflammation in AD, consistent with approaches attributed to personalized medicine. For example, the efficacy of NSAIDs will be dependent on the contribution and functional consequence of COX signaling on the NIP at different stages of AD, which may be further modulated by other risk factors. Indeed, in-depth analysis of ADAPT has raised the intriguing possibility that NSAID efficacy, either beneficial or detrimental for AD risk, may be dependent on whether individuals experience fast or slow rates of cognitive decline (Leoutsakoset al. 2012). One approach to identify the NIP and pathway interactions is using non-biased 'omic' approaches, which has and will continue to provide valuable data. An alternative approach is to measure select candidate markers in functional NIP classifications. An increasingly adopted classification is based on applying the peripheral T-cell/macrophage inflammatory phenotype nomenclature to microglia, namely, M1 (pro-inflammatory), M2A (anti-inflammatory, phagocytic), M2B (unclear function, general M2 response), and M2C (tissue remodeling, matrix deposition) (Mantovaniet al. 2002; Gordon2003; Mantovaniet al. 2004; Mosser Edwards2008; Aguzziet al. 2013; Cherryet al. 2014). One hypothesis proposes that a prolonged activation of the M1 and suppression of the M2 states underlies the detrimental inflammatory phenotype in AD and other chronic neurodegenerative disorders (Cherryet al. 2014). However, there are several potential confounding factors with this classification including (i) the assumption that peripheral inflammation directly translates to the NIP, (ii) the assumption that microglia produce all cytokines and are the only functionally relevant neuroinflammatory cell type in the brain, and (iii) the restriction of the inflammatory phenotype to two to four potential classifications, i.e., in some cases features of both an M1 and M2 phenotype will be observed, and not all markers within an M class will be equally affected through the course of AD. Indeed, the latter point was initially described by Coltonet al. (2006) using mouse and human tissue, with data suggesting that (when using the microglial classification system) innate immune cells in the AD brain exhibit a hybrid of activation states. An alternative perspective is to divide inflammatory mediators by function into the subclassifications pro-inflammatory, anti-inflammatory, repair, and immunoregulatory, as presented by Chhoret al. (2013), incorporate the M1/2A/2B/2C classifications (Mantovaniet al. 2002; Gordon2003; Mantovaniet al. 2004; Mosser Edwards2008) and include additional inflammatory receptors (Table 1). Table 1lists the candidate neuroinflammatory markers for the genomic analysis described inNovelNoneandNoneanalysis of APOE-modulated Abeta-induced neuroinflammation, as this type of classification has the advantage that it is not specific to microglial cells, thus enabling subsequent assignment of function for pathway and cell-specific mechanistic studies. Potential limitations of this classification include an oversimplification of mediator function and the pre-selection of mediators. Indeed, if assessed using unbiased approaches, the functional network genetic profile of the NIP in AD will be much broader than the genes in Table 1, as observedin vitro(Hickmanet al. 2013; Butovskyet al. 2014). Nonetheless, unbiased and candidate approaches, which can both become targeted depending on their interpretation and application, are currently being pursued by the field to further define the AD-NIP and track the expression of the NIP at different stages of AD pathology. Critical considerations include the functional classification system used to define the NIP, recognition that not all markers within a class will be modulated equally, and that during AD progression, the multiphasic expression of the NIP may help explain conflicting therapeutic data. Thus, once the NIP profile is identified, detailed cellular pathway analysis can be conducted, including the effect of known risk factors. Select markers of the neuroinflammatory phenotypeAdapted from Chhoret al. (2013). Experimental data have established that the neuroinflammatory receptors TREM2, CD33, and CR1 are genetic risk factors for AD. Neuroinflammatory receptor activation can modulate both Abeta phagocytosis and the levels of inflammatory mediators in the NIP. TREM2, expressed by microglia, is hypothesized to function as a phagocytic receptor for neuronal debris and Abeta, and to suppresses a pro-inflammatory response, particularly after TLR activation, e.g., TLR4 (reviewed in Ford McVicar2009; Chouraki Seshadri2014; Hickman El Khoury2014; Lueet al. 2014). Thus, loss of function single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TREM2 that increase AD risk are thought to decrease Abeta phagocytosis and promote a pro-inflammatory response. For CD33, data conflict as to whether identified SNPs increase AD risk (reviewed in Bradshawet al. 2013; Jianget al. 2014). For example, the rs3865444 SNP in CD33 has been demonstrated to both increase and decrease AD risk in different populations (Lambertet al. 2013; Chouraki Seshadri2014; Liet al. 2014). Hypotheses to account for the differences include linkage disequilibrium across populations, and/or modulation of the rs3865444 SNP effect on AD risk by population-specific environmental and lifestyle factors. However, the minor allele of the CD33 rs3865444 SNP is thought to decrease AD risk through reducing microglial expression of CD33, thus increasing Abeta phagocytosis. Less data are available on how SNPs in CR1 may impact AD risk compared to TREM2 or CD33, although the complement system in general has, and remains, a focus of AD research (reviewed in Crehanet al. 2012; Shenet al. 2013). Functionally, the SNPs in CR1 may modulate microglial phagocytosis of C3b-opsonized Abeta, and also remove increased unbound C3b levels to limit complement-mediated inflammation in AD. Additional inflammatory receptors activated by Abeta, particularly aggregated forms, i.e., oAbeta, have also been identified in genetic or experimental studies. In astrocytes, these receptors include members of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) family, scavenger receptors, formyl peptide receptor-like 1 (FPRL1), and leucine-rich glioma inactivated protein 3 (LGL3). In microglia, Abeta receptors include scavenger receptors, CD14, CD47, CD36, TLR2, and TLR4 (Mohamed Posse de Chaves2011; Meraz-Rioset al. 2013; Yu Ye2014). Furthermore, the ability of microglia, and other immune cells, to phagocytose Abeta has led to the development of both active and passive Abeta immunization strategies for AD (reviewed in Lambracht-Washington Rosenberg2013; Hardyet al. 2014; Karran Hardy2014). Passive immunization with Abeta antibodies, which in part clear Abeta via Fc receptors expressed on microglia, is the most actively pursued approach. In general, passive immunization has failed to stop or reverse cognitive decline when used as a treatment for AD, although there is hope that the approach will prove efficacious in prevention paradigms. Although there is evidence of extracellular Abeta clearance with passive immunization, side effects include edema and cerebral microhemorrhage, identified by amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (Sperlinget al. 2011; Sperlinget al. 2012). It has also been proposed that some of the negative side effects from Fc-dependent Abeta phagocytosis may be the result of a pro-inflammatory response (Fulleret al. 2014; Liuet al. 2014). Thus, an important issue when assessing the functional role of neuroinflammatory receptors in AD is whether Abeta-binding causes Abeta degradation (i.e., phagocytosis) and/or an inflammatory response. Indeed, although Abeta phagocytosis will be beneficial for AD, an associated chronic pro-inflammatory response and decreased anti-inflammatory/repair response may lower the expression of phagocytic receptors (Hickmanet al. 2008), induce neuronal damage, and prevent neuronal recovery. In addition, the functional effect of inflammatory receptors in AD results from a combination of responses by multiple cell types that express the same inflammatory receptor (e.g., Fc receptors are expressed by BECs and glia, TLR4 is expressed by neurons, microglia, and BECs). Finally, inflammatory receptor signaling may be species specific (e.g., TLR4, CD33), potentially limiting the relevance of FAD-Tg mice as a preclinical model. In summary, a major goal for determining the effect of neuroinflammation on AD progression is the identification of novel therapeutic targets. However, the complex nature of neuroinflammation has resulted in conflicting data on the role of specific inflammatory mediators and receptors. Important issues facing the field include dissecting the neuroinflammatory activity of the different forms of Abeta, identifying the multiphasic expression of the NIP during AD pathology, and assessing neuroinflammatory receptor pathways as therapeutic targets. Human apoE (h-apoE) has three isoforms that differ by a single amino acid substitution at residues 112 or 158: apoE2 contains Cys112, 158apoE3 contains Cys112Arg158and apoE4 contains Arg112,158(for review Weisgraberet al. 1982). ApoE is the major apolipoprotein present on lipoproteins in the central nervous system (CNS) (for review LaDuet al. 2000). Indeed, apoE-containing CNS lipoproteins are separate from apoE-containing lipoproteins in the periphery. This compartmentalization was definitively demonstrated in human liver transplantation studies, as the liver is the primary source of peripheral apoE. If the donor liver was from anAPOE4/4individual and the recipient was anAPOE3/3, apoE4/4 became the peripheral isoform while apoE3/3 remained the isoform in the CNS (Lintonet al. 1991). In the CNS, apoE is produced primarily by glia (astrocytes and microglia), although under certain conditions of stress, neuronal apoE expression may occur (Xuet al. 2006). The function(s) of apoE are, in part, mediated via members of the LDLR family expressed throughout the CNS, with astrocytes, microglia, and neurons expressing LDLR, LDLR-related protein 1 (LRP1), very LDL receptor, and ApoER2. LDLR and LRP1 are endocytic receptors, while very LDL receptor and ApoER2, as well as LRP1, are signaling receptors (Holtzmanet al. 2012). AlthoughAPOEgenotype/apoE isoform-specific effects have been described for virtually all the proposed pathogenic AD pathways (Bu2009; Liuet al. 2013), accumulating evidence supports a role for h-APOEin modulating neuroinflammation (Keeneet al. 2011). These data are derived fromin vivoandin vitroexperiments in the absence of Abeta, both in the periphery and the CNS, and limited data for Abeta-induced neuroinflammation. Extensive data demonstrate that, in response to a peripheral inflammatory stimulus, pro-inflammatory cytokine production is higher withAPOE4compared toAPOE3. In a groundbreaking study by Gale and co-workers, healthy volunteers were subjected to intravenous (IV) administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a TLR4 agonist and bacterial endotoxin used to elicit a general inflammatory response (Galeet al. 2014). LPS-induced hyperthermia and increased plasma levels of pro-inflammatory markers (TNFalpha, IL-6) were higher inAPOE3/4carriers compared toAPOE3/3carriers (Galeet al. 2014), data recapitulated in Tg mice. Indeed, inAPOE-targeted replacement mice (APOE-TR) (Sullivanet al. 1997,1998), which express the h-APOEgenotypes (see 'APOE-modulated inflammation: current perspective'), peritoneal LPS injection results in thermal dysregulation (in this case hypothermia), higher plasma levels of TNFalpha, and higher markers of liver toxicity withAPOE4compared toAPOE3(Galeet al. 2014). In vitrodata support thisAPOE4inflammatory phenotype in the periphery. In whole blood samples isolated from healthy volunteers, TLR4/LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine (TNFalpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, IFNgamma) secretion is higher withAPOE3/4compared toAPOE3/3(Galeet al. 2014). In addition, LPS-induced TNFalpha levels are higher, and anti-inflammatory markers (IL-10) are lower, withAPOE4compared toAPOE3in a monocyte-macrophage cell line (Jofre-Monsenyet al. 2007). Furthermore, efferocytosis (phagocytosis of dead/dying cells) is decreased in macrophages isolated fromAPOE4-TRmice compared toAPOE3-TRmice (Cashet al. 2012). Despite these findings, data are conflicted on whether the increased levels of select pro-inflammatory markers and decreased levels of anti-inflammatory markers withAPOE4are beneficial or detrimental for peripheral infection. Indeed, althoughAPOE-knock out (KO) mice demonstrate an impaired immune response to various bacteria, includingListeria monocytogenesandKlebsiella pneumonia(Roselaar Daugherty1998; de Bontet al. 1999; Zhuet al. 2012), youngAPOE4humans have an increased pathogen resistance for hepatitis C-induced liver damage compared toAPOE3(Wozniaket al. 2002), andAPOE4protects against damage caused byCryptosporidiuminfection (Azevedoet al. 2014). The beneficial effect withAPOE4may be related to the enhanced pro-inflammatory response (TNFalpha and NO) and/or effects on cellular arginine uptake to produce NO, ultimately disrupting pathogen function (Brownet al. 2002; Viteket al. 2009). APOEmodulation of peripheral immunity may also play a role inAPOE4-induced AD risk. Independent of disease status,APOE4carriers have lower levels of CXCL9 (a T-cell attractant), and higher levels of IL-13 (anti-parasitic) in the plasma compared toAPOE3carriers (Soareset al. 2012). The data for CXCL9 may be significant, as apoE can suppress T-cell levels (Kellyet al. 1994; Mistryet al. 1995) and there is an age- andAPOE-dependent decrease in Abeta-specific CD4+T-cell activity in humans (Begumet al. 2014). Indeed, Abeta-specific CD4+T-cell activity follows the order:APOE4-negative males greater than APOE4-positive males greater than APOE4-negative females greater than APOE4-positive females (Begumet al. 2014). However, the significance of this T-cell response for AD pathogenesis remains unclear. APOEgenotype also affects the therapeutic efficacy of bone marrow transplant (BMT)in vivo. After BMT fromAPOE-TR mice to an FAD-Tg mouse model (specifically the APP/PS1 model, bearing APP K670N/M671L and PS1 L166P, both under the control of Thy1),APOE4-recipient FAD-Tg mice demonstrate significantly impaired spatial working memory, higher levels of Abeta and pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNFalpha), and lower levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10) compared toAPOE3-recipient FAD-Tg mice receiving BMT fromAPOE3-TR mice (Yanget al. 2013). Thus,APOEimpacts peripheral immunity and inflammation, although further research is required to determine whether and how these effects apply to CNS function. The effects ofAPOEon Abeta-independent neuroinflammation have been investigated inAPOE-TR mice, likely the most physiologically relevant model for the study of h-apoE isoforms (Sullivanet al. 1997,1998). In these mice, the coding domain for one of the h-apoE isoforms replaces the coding domain for mouse apoE (m-apoE). Thus, the h-apoE is expressed in a native conformation at physiologically regulated levels, and in the same temporal and spatial pattern as endogenous m-apoE. InAPOE-TR mice, intraperitoneal injection of LPS results in higher cortical TNFalpha and IL-12 (pro-inflammatory) expression withAPOE4compared toAPOE3(Viteket al. 2009). However, as LPS demonstrates low brain bioavailability (Banks Robinson2010), this effect is likely due to peripheralAPOEgenotype-specific effects or BEC inflammatory responses. Direct intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of LPS into the CNS ofAPOE-TR mice (4 months) demonstrate that after 24 and 72 h, synaptic protein levels decrease, microglia and astrocyte activation increase, and pro-inflammatory cytokine (TNFalpha, IL-6, IL-1beta) levels increase, and follow the order:APOE4 greater than APOE3 = APOE2. Furthermore, dendrites fail to recover withAPOE4but notAPOE2orAPOE3(72 h post-ICV LPS injection) in 6-week-oldAPOE-TR mice (Maezawaet al. 2006c). These data indicate that TLR4 activation via LPS impairs the repair/recovery function ofAPOE4compared toAPOE2/3. However, it is not clear whether these effects are due to direct TLR4 activation of neurons, or through neuroinflammatory mediators secreted by activated glia. Thus, forAPOEmodulation of acute neuroinflammation, the overall response is likely a combination of the inflammatory profile prior to inflammatory insult, the magnitude of response to the inflammatory insult, and the inflammatory response following inflammatory insult, all of which may be relevant for determining the AD-NIP. In vitrodata using microglia isolated fromAPOE-TR mice validateAPOEgenotype-specific modulation of TLR4/LPS-induced inflammation (reviewed in Keeneet al. 2011). In microglia, LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine (TNFalpha, IL-6, and IL-1beta) levels are higher withAPOE4thanAPOE3, with a delayed but similar response for NO (pro-inflammatory) (Maezawaet al. 2006b). Furthermore, after combined LPS/IFNgamma treatment of microglia, pro-inflammatory cytokine (TNFalpha, IL-6, and IL-12) levels are higher and anti-inflammatory/repair cytokine (IL-4) levels are lower withAPOE4compared toAPOE3(Viteket al. 2009). Importantly, the effect of TLR4 activation on neuronal function is recapitulatedin vitro, with microglial cytokine secretion hypothesized as the major effector. Indeed, in microglia/neuron co-cultures, LPS-induced microglia-mediated decreases in synaptic proteins follow the order:APOE4 greater than APOE3 greater than APOE2,results repeated in hippocampal slice cultures (Keeneet al. 2011). The decreased synaptic protein levels are correlated with the secretion of TNFalpha, IL-1beta, or IL-6, rather than NO by microglia (Maezawaet al. 2006b). Interestingly, pathway analysis supports that LPS-induced activation of the p38alpha pathway in microglia mediates the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly TNFalpha, that cause decreases in synaptic proteins (Maezawaet al. 2006b; Xinget al. 2011). LPS-induced NO secretion by microgliain vitrois suppressed by an apoE peptide that consists of a tandem repeat of the apoE-receptor-binding domain, residues 136-142 (Pocivavseket al. 2009a,b). This suppression of NO secretion is attributed to LRP1-dependent activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway (Pocivavseket al. 2009a,b), although the relevance of these data to full-length apoE peptide remains unclear. A potential overall mechanism for these data is that TLR4-p38alpha pro-inflammatory cytokine production activates the JNK pathway (e.g., TNFalpha signaling through the TNF receptor) to induce NO secretion. ApoE could suppress p38alpha and/or JNK via the LDLR family in an apoE isoform-specific manner: apoE2 greater than apoE3 greater than apoE4 (Fig. 1a). Additional study of the intracellular signaling cascades modulated by apoE may provide therapeutic opportunities for modulating acute neuroinflammation. In astrocytes, TLR4/LPS-induced secretion of TNFalpha, IL-1beta, or IL-6 follows the pattern: less than italic greater than APOE2 greater than = APOE3 greater than = less than /italic greater than APOE4,via differential NF-kappaB activation (Maezawaet al. 2006a) (Fig. 1a). This is in direct contrast to microglia, where LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion is:APOE4 greater than APOE3 greater than APOE2. These data, and the paracrine-like signaling that occurs between inflammatory cells (Landreth Reed-Geaghan2009; Okunet al. 2009; Buchananet al. 2010; Cameron Landreth2010; Hennessyet al. 2010; Okunet al. 2011; Hanamsagaret al. 2012), indicate that incorporating both astrocytes and microgliain vitromay represent a more physiologically relevant model. Astrocyte activation may also modulate microglial migration. Indeed, in astrocytes isolated fromAPOE-TR mice, TLR4/LPS- and TLR3/Poly I:C-induced production of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 3 (CCL3) follows the order:APOE2 = APOE4 greater than APOE3(Cudabacket al. 2015). Furthermore, CCL3 levels are higher withAPOE4compared toAPOE3in the cortex (CX) ofAPOE-TR mice (after peritoneal LPS injection) and in the parietal CX of AD patients (Cudabacket al. 2015). APOEalso modulates BBB function via differential pericyte activation in a process that could be considered neuroinflammatory (Bellet al. 2012). Compared toAPOE2-andAPOE3-TR mice,APOE4-TR andAPOE-KO mice demonstrated BBB impairments that include reduced cerebral blood flow, reduced microvascular length, and increased BBB permeability (Bellet al. 2012). At the cellular level, theAPOE-modulated changes in BBB function are associated with DNA fragmentation in pericytes and BECs, and diminished microvascular coverage by pericytes. Furthermore, pharmacological and genetic analyses ofAPOE-TR mice support the idea that apoE3 and apoE2, but not apoE4, signal via LRP1 to suppress the cyclophilin A-NF-kappaB-matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) pathway in pericytes (Bellet al. 2012). Thus, higher MMP9 levels withAPOE4compromise BEC function, including decreased levels of tight junction proteins, leading to BBB dysfunction (Bellet al. 2012) (Fig. 1b). As discussed previously, whether pro-inflammatory cytokines are considered detrimental or beneficial likely depends (seeNeuroinflammation in ADandAPOE modulates the peripheral immune response to stressors that mimic infection) on the disease state. For example, in tissue from epilepsy patients, neuronal resilience, astrocyte and microglial activation, IL-1alpha, and IL-1beta levels are all higher withAPOE3compared toAPOE4(Wilcock Griffin2013). This increased pro-inflammatory response withAPOE3, potentially the result of neuronal hyperactivation and increased Abeta production, is considered protective, in contrast with increased pro-inflammatory cytokine production withAPOE4after LPS-induced activation (Maezawaet al. 2006b; Zhuet al. 2012). However, for both epilepsy and LPS, overall neuronal function is worse withAPOE4thanAPOE3, highlighting the context specificity of neuroinflammatory responses. In contrast toAPOEmodulation of acute TLR4/LPS-induced neuroinflammation, data are limited onAPOEmodulation of Abeta-induced neuroinflammationin vivoandin vitro. Indeed, the data described above for peripheral inflammation in AD patients and FAD-Tg mice, and the increased CCL3 levels withAPOE4in AD patients, are almost the extent of published research in this field. Furtherin vivodata have demonstrated that hippocampal astrocyte and microglial activation are increased inAPOE4-TR, but notAPOE3-TR mice after inhibition of the Abeta- degrading enzyme neprilysin (Belinson Michaelson2009). In addition, in novel EFAD transgenic mice (further described inNovelNoneandNoneanalysis of APOE-modulated Abeta-induced neuroinflammation), which express 5xFAD mutations and h-APOE(Youmanset al. 2012),cortical microglial activation is greater surrounding plaques in E4FAD (APOE4) compared to E3FAD (APOE3) mice (Rodriguezet al. 2014). Whilein vitrodata demonstrate that m-apoE and h-apoE affect Abeta-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion, there are apparent contradictions among studies. Indeed, Abeta42-induced increases in IL-6, inducible NO synthase (iNOS), and IL-1beta levels are greater in mixed glial cultures (95% astrocytes, 5% microglia) isolated fromAPOE-KO mice compared to wild-type mice (LaDuet al. 2001). ApoE3 and apoE4, isolated from the conditioned media of human embryonic kidney cells transfected with h-apoE cDNA (HEK-apoE), suppress Abeta-induced glial inflammatory responses, with no apoE isoform effects (Huet al. 1998; Guoet al. 2004). However, HEK-apoE3 and HEK-apoE4 induce inflammation (IL-1beta) in the absence of Abeta42 (Guoet al. 2004), confounding data interpretation. Dorey and co-workers have also reported that the Abeta-induced inflammatory response in astrocytes is in the order:APOE4 greater than APOE3 greater than APOE2, although no published evidence is included (Doreyet al. 2014). In addition, Abeta degradation via MMP9 is greater in macrophages expressingAPOE2thanAPOE3orAPOE4and this effect appears to be dependent on LDLR signaling (Zhaoet al. 2009). Section Neuroinflammation in ADoutlines the various factors that influence Abeta-induced inflammation and phagocytosis as well as the receptors and signaling pathways involved. These variables also apply to anyAPOEmodulation of Abeta-induced neuroinflammatory processes. In summary, there is a growing body of work demonstrating thatAPOE4exerts a negative effect on peripheral and Abeta-independent neuroinflammation, compared toAPOE3. However, data onAPOEmodulation of Abeta-induced chronic neuroinflammationin vivoandin vitroare limited. Because of the paucity of research and critical importance of the topic, we have begun to dissect the effects of the h-apoE isoforms on Abeta-induced neuroinflammation. We present data testing whether h-apoE modulates the NIP in the new EFAD-Tg mouse model, and the effect ofAPOEon oAbeta-induced TNFalpha secretionin vitro. EFAD mice are the result of crossing 5xFAD mice (APP K670N/M671L + I716V + V717I and PS1 M146L + L286V) andAPOE-TR mice (Youmanset al. 2012). All experiments follow the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee protocols. EFAD mice were housed in theCollege of Medicine Research Building(COMRB) animal facility (IACUC 14-088). The COMRB is the campus barrier facility that oversees the procurement, care, and maintenance of animals used in the teaching and research programs of the UIC. This oversight responsibility includes ensuring that the UIC program meets federal regulations, the requirements of the American Association for the Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC), and currently accepted standards for providing adequate veterinary care and proper animal husbandry (the PHS assurance number is A3460-01). The COMRB staff continually monitors temperature, light timers, cage-washing procedures, sterilizer operation, automatic watering system, and animal health. EFAD mice were housed two to five mice per cage and maintained on a standard 12-h light-dark cycle with access to food and waterad libitum. Six and 8-month-old male E3FAD and E4FAD mice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg) and transcardially perfused with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors (set 3; Calbiochem, San Diego, CA, USA). One milliliter of RNAlatersolution (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) was added to 20 mg of cortical brain tissue dissected from the right hemi-brains of EFAD mice, samples were incubated at 4 degrees C overnight and stored at -80 degrees C to ensure minimal mRNA degradation. Quantitative mRNA analysis was performed using a custom-designed QuantiGene 2.0 Multiplex assay system (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) for the markers in Table 1, according to the manufacturer's protocol, by an investigator blinded toAPOEgenotype and age. Briefly, samples were thawed, RNAlater removed, and cortices lysed in the QuantiGene homogenizing solution. Subsequently, magnetic beads containing target-specific probes were added, followed by sequential hybridization and signal amplification. Signal intensity was measured using a Luminex array system (Bio-Rad Bio-Plex; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Mean fluorescence intensity values were adjusted by blank value subtraction, and standardized to the housekeeping gene GUSB. Data were analyzed with the MasterPlex(r)EX software (Hitachi-Solution America, San Bruno, CA, USA). An important consideration for the analysis of mRNA expression data is the reference gene utilized for normalization. For this manuscript, the expression of three reference genes was assessed: ACTB, RPLN0, and GUSB. ACTB levels were at the upper end of the mean fluorescence intensity limit of detection at the sample dilutions required to measure the genes in Table 1, and therefore ACTB was not suitable as a reference gene. The levels of RPLN0 and GUSB were not significantly different byAPOEgenotype (APOE3compared toAPOE4) or age (6 months compared to 8 months) in EFAD mice when assessed using two-wayanovafollowed by Bonferronipost hocanalysis. Through our analysis of mRNA expression in cortical tissue from EFAD mice, similar results are obtained when normalizing with either RPLN0 or GUSB; however, baseline RPLN0 expression is more varied (data not shown). Furthermore, GUSB is reported as one of the three most stable reference genes in the cerebral CX of rats following traumatic brain injury (Cooket al. 2009). Thus, GUSB was utilized as the reference gene for this study. An important caveat is that GUSB expression has been described as the eighth most stable reference in feline brain (Kessleret al. 2009), to fluctuate in some experimental conditions (Cooket al. 2009; Gubernet al. 2009; Pernotet al. 2010; Swijsenet al. 2012), and to decrease with age (from post-natal days 7-6 months) in the cerebellum of mice (Bodaet al. 2009). An ongoing aspect of our work is dissecting in larger sample sets the expression of reference genes by brain region,APOEgenotype, and Abeta accumulation (age) in EFAD mice. Mixed glial cultures (95% astrocytes, 5% microglia) were isolated fromAPOE-TR andAPOE-KO mice as described (Whiteet al. 2005; Nwabuisi-Heathet al. 2012). Glial cultures (24-well plates) were incubated with oAbeta42 (0-10 muM) (see Stineet al. 2003; Whiteet al. 2005for details) or LPS (0-100 ng/mL), +/- LPSRS, IAXO101, IAXO103, IAXO202 (Innaxon, Tewkesbury, UK), MW181 (Wattersonet al. 2013, Bachstetteret al. 2014), or vehicle control, at the concentrations indicated in the figures (N.B. MW181 was added 30 min prior to the addition of LPS or oAbeta). Twenty four hours later, TNFalpha levels were measured in the conditioned media by ELISA (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Data were analyzed by one-wayanovafollowed by Tukey'spost hocanalysis or two-wayanovafollowed by Bonferronipost hocanalysis (Fig. 2b) using GraphPad Prism version 6 for Macintosh. Heat map complete-linkage clustering between gene expression profiles was performed in R, using Pearson's correlation as the distance measure. IL-2 and IFNgamma values from the E3FAD-CX at 8 months were removed because of low quality and were replaced with mean expression for the gene during clustering (represented by black spaces in the heat map). A lack of tractable h-APOE/FAD-Tg models has hindered research efforts to determine the effect ofAPOEon AD-relevant pathways (Taiet al. 2011). To identify the effects ofAPOEgenotype-specific modulated neuroinflammation induced by Abeta pathology, we utilized EFAD-Tg mice (Youmanset al. 2012). EFAD mice are an AD model expressing h-APOEunder the regulated control of the endogenous m-apoE promoter (APOE-TR) (Sullivanet al. 1997,1998), and over-expressing h-Abeta42 via the 5xFAD-Tg mice (Oakleyet al. 2006). EFAD mice have enabled research on the role ofAPOEin AD-like pathology (Youmanset al. 2012; Kunzleret al. 2013; Taiet al. 2013) and for preclinical assessment of potential AD therapeutics (Taiet al. 2014a). Briefly, we have demonstrated that in E4FAD mice, compared to E3FAD mice, there are reduced post-synaptic protein levels, increased extracellular and soluble Abeta levels (including oAbeta), reduced levels of soluble Abeta bound to apoE (apoE/Abeta complex), and reduced apoE lipoprotein association/lipidation at 6 months in the CX and hippocampus. Furthermore, microglial activation is increased in the vicinity of plaques in the CX of 6-month-old E4FAD mice compared to E3FAD mice (Rodriguezet al. 2014). Although immunohistochemistry analysis is important for analyzing the local environment and gliosis, biochemical analysis is critical to begin defining a NIP. Therefore, the markers in Table 1were measured at the mRNA level in the CX of EFAD mice at 6 and 8 months using multiplex analysis. Cluster analysis of mRNA data for EFAD mice at 6 and 8 months demonstrates thatAPOEhas a pronounced impact on factors selected as representative of the inflammatory activation states and associated receptors (Table 1and Fig. 2a). A large cluster of genes (C1) was identified with lower expression in the E3FAD-CX at 6 months, including select markers in the pro-inflammatory (TNFalpha, IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-6, and IFNgamma) and anti-inflammatory (TGFbeta1 and IL-10) classifications. The expression of genes in C1 increases in the E3FAD-CX from 6 to 8 months, including pro-inflammatory markers (e.g., TNFalpha, IL-6), a subcluster (C1.1.2) of select anti-inflammatory markers (suppressor of cytokine signalling (SOCS) 2, SOCS3, IL-10, SPHK1/1), immunoregulatory markers (MRC1), and inflammatory receptors (CCR2), potentially as an adaptive response not observed in E4FAD mice. In the E4FAD-CX, a subset of genes in C1 (C1.2) is consistently high at both 6 and 8 months, which encompasses markers in all NIP classifications (e.g., TNFalpha, IL-1beta, IL-10, and TLR2). In addition, the expression of genes in a different subcluster of C1, C1.1.1 also increases from 6 to 8 months in the E4FAD-CX mice, including repair (FIZZ1) and immunoregulatory (CCL2 GAL3R) markers, potentially as anAPOE4-specific adaptive response. Importantly, a second large cluster (C2) was identified with higher expression in E3FAD-CX and lower expression in the E4FAD-CX at 6 months. The majority of C2 markers are in the anti-inflammatory (CXCL1, TGFbeta3, and SOCS1) and repair (chitinase-like 3 (YM1), arginase 1 (ARG1), colony stimulating factor 3 (CSF3)) categories and also include the IL-4Ralpha subunit (see 'EFAD-Tg mice: TLR4 associated cytokines are higher and IL-4R lower with APOE4' below). The expression of C2 markers was decreased from 6 to 8 months in both E3FAD and E4FAD mice. To further dissect these data, inflammatory receptor expression was specifically compared, expressed relative to E3FAD-CX at 6 months (Fig. 2b). Three significant results are observed. First, from 6 to 8 months, expression of CD33 decreases and TREM2 increased in E3FAD and E4FAD mice. These data are confounding, as genetic evidence indicates that TREM2 is protective (Guerreiroet al. 2013; Jonssonet al. 2013) while CD33 increases AD risk (Hollingworthet al. 2011; Najet al. 2011; Greenet al. 2014) and therefore might be expected to decrease and increase, respectively, with increasing Abeta pathology. Thus, our data suggest that the changes in TREM2 and CD33 in EFAD mice are an adaptive response to high Abeta levels regardless ofAPOEgenotype. Second, TLR4 expression increases from 6 to 8 months in EFAD mice for bothAPOE3andAPOE4. Interestingly, TLR4-dependent neuroinflammation has been shown to decrease neuronal viabilityin vivo(Lehnardtet al. 2003; Lehnardt2010). Third, IL-4Ralpha expression is 50% lower in 6-month-old E4FAD mice compared to E3FAD mice. In the periphery, TLR4 and IL-4R are described as opposite ends of the inflammatory spectrum, with TLR4 linked to a pro-inflammatory response and IL-4R to an anti-inflammatory/repair response, at least for select markers (Chhoret al. 2013; Cherryet al. 2014). Therefore, the expression of inflammatory markers linked to TLR4 and IL-4R signaling was plotted at 6 months, expressed relative to E3FAD-CX (Fig. 2c). Data demonstrate that select markers of TLR4 signaling are greater (e.g., TNFalpha, IL-1beta, and IL-1RN), and markers of IL-4R signaling lower (e.g., SOCS1, YM1, and ARG1), in E4FAD mice at 6 months. Thus, even though TLR4 expression is lower in E4FAD mice at 6 months, TLR4-associated cytokines are higher. As described above, age (6-8 months) significantly impacts the expression of the inflammatory genes in EFAD mice, which in general results in greater increases in TLR4 and decreases in IL-4R related genes for E3FAD mice compared to E4FAD mice; however there are exceptions. Thus, a comparison of the same genes at 8 months (Fig. 2d) demonstrates that select TLR4-related genes are non-significantly (TNFalpha) and significantly higher (IL-10, IL-1RN) in E4FAD mice compared to E3FAD mice. For IL-4R-related genes at 8 months, SOCS1 and YM1 remained lower in E4FAD mice compared to E3FAD mice, whereas FIZZ1 was higher in E4FAD mice, data that contrast with the results at 6 months. These data re-emphasize that theAPOE-modulated NIP can vary as AD pathology progresses. In summary, these data support the differential modulation of TLR4 and IL-4R pathways as underling the unique NIP at early stages of Abeta pathology in E4FAD mice at 6 months. The overall goal of thein vitroexperiments was to dissect the effect ofAPOEon oAbeta-induced TNFalpha secretion. Mixed cultures were selected to account for the paracrine-like signaling that can occur between astrocytes and microglia, and therefore to mimic more closelyin vivoneuroinflammation. However, as TLR4/LPS-induced TNFalpha secretion follows opposing rank orders in astrocytes (APOE2 greater than = less than italic greater than APOE3 greater than = APOE4 less than /italic greater than ) and microglia (APOE4 greater than APOE3 greater than APOE2) (Fig. 1a), initially the effect ofAPOEon LPS-induced TNFalpha secretion was determined in mixed glial cultures (95% astrocytes, 5% microglia) isolated fromAPOE-TR andAPOE-KO mice. To monitor neuroinflammationin vitro,TNFalpha (pro-inflammatory) secretion was measured in the media by ELISA, as overall data support a detrimental role for TNFalpha in AD (reviewed in Tobinick2009). In the mixed glial cultures fromAPOE-TR andAPOE-KO mice, LPS (100 ng/mL, 24-h incubation)-induced TNFalpha levels from highest to lowest are:APOE-KO greater than APOE4 greater than APOE3 greater than APOE2(Fig. 3a). Indeed, compared withAPOE3, TNFalpha levels are 50% higher withAPOE4and 50% lower withAPOE2. These data are consistent with microglial rather than astrocyticAPOEgenotype-specific TNFalpha secretion (Maezawaet al. 2006a), potentially because of paracrine-like signaling between the two glial cell types. Next, whether TLR4 antagonism could inhibit LPS-induced TNFalpha secretion was determined. LPS activates TLR4 through four proteins, LPS-binding protein (LBP), CD14, the myeloid differentiation protein-2 (MD-2), and TLR4. Essentially, LBP interacts with and transfers LPS to CD14, which in turn transfers LPS to MD-2 (Ulevitch Tobias1999). An activated [TLR4.MD-2.LPS]2complex was then formed that induces TLR4 signaling. LPS fromRhodobacter sphaeroides(LPS-RS) inhibits the MD2-TLR4 interaction and was therefore a TLR4 antagonist. Consistent with TLR4 activation, LPS-RS (10 mug/mL) inhibits LPS (100 ng/mL)-induced TNFalpha secretion in mixed glial cultures isolated from all three strains ofAPOE-TR mice andAPOE-KO mice (Fig. 3a). As described (seeAbeta-dependent activation of neuroinflammation), dissectingAPOEmodulation of oAbeta-induced neuroinflammationin vitroremains an important question. Indeed, unlike TLR4/LPS-induced activation of microglia and astrocytes, the effect and potential pathways underlyingAPOEmodulation of oAbeta-induced acute cytokine secretionin vitroremain unknown, which confounds the development of futurein vitroexperiments to mimic long-term neuroinflammation. oAbeta (10 muM, 24-h incubation)-induced TNFalpha secretion follows the identical rank order as for LPS in the isolated mixed glial cultures:APOE-KO greater than APOE4 greater than APOE3 greater than APOE2(Fig. 3b). For example, TNFalpha levels are 80% higher withAPOE4compared toAPOE3. AsAPOEmodulated both oAbeta- and TLR4/LPS-induced neuroinflammation, we explored whether TLR4 antagonism also blocks oAbeta-induced TNFalpha secretion. LPS-RS (10 mug/mL) antagonizes oAbeta-induced (10 muM) TNFalpha secretion, resulting in an ~ 80% reduction in TNFalpha levels in glia isolated from all three strains ofAPOE-TR mice andAPOE-KO mice (Fig. 3b). To dissect whether antagonists of additional TLR4 signaling complex components also inhibit oAbeta-induced TNFalpha secretion, novel antagonists of the CD14-MD2 interaction, IAXO101 and IAXO103, were utilized. At an equivalent concentration (5 mug/mL), IAXO101 and IAXO103 are more potent than LPS-RS, whereas the inactive IAXO202 control did not suppress oAbeta-induced TNFalpha secretion in mixed glial cultures fromAPOE4-TR mice (Fig. 3c). A potential down-stream signaling pathway of TLR4 is p38alpha, and p38alpha inhibitors suppress LPS- and Abeta42-induced neuroinflammationin vitroandin vivo(Wattersonet al. 2013; Bachstetteret al. 2014). As LPS- and oAbeta-induced TNFalpha secretion are both inhibited by TLR4 antagonists, mixed glial cultures fromAPOE3-TR andAPOE4-TR mice were used to define the role of p38alpha in both LPS- and oAbeta-induced TNFalpha secretion. In this study, MW181, a p38alpha inhibitor (Wattersonet al. 2013), dose-dependently inhibits LPS- and oAbeta-induced TNFalpha secretion for bothAPOE3andAPOE4(Fig. 3d and e). In summary,in vitrodata indicate that apoE4 represents a loss of positive function rather than a toxic gain of function for oAbeta-induced TNFalpha secretion (i.e., TNFalpha levels are higher in mixed glia isolated fromAPOE-KO compared toAPOE4mice, seeAPOE4 is likely a loss of positive function for Abeta-induced neuroinflammation), andAPOEgenotype-specific modulation of TNFalpha secretion follows the same pattern ofAPOE-induced AD risk:APOE4 greater than APOE3 greater than APOE2. An additional observation is that LPS (100 ng/mL) induces greater TNFalpha secretion than oAbeta (10 muM). LPS is a high-affinity agonist for TLR4, and therefore at low concentrations induces robust functional effectsin vivo, including TNFalpha secretion and neuronal dysfunction in acute studies (Maezawaet al. 2006b; Pocivavseket al. 2009a,b; Viteket al. 2009; Keeneet al. 2011; Zhuet al. 2012; Galeet al. 2014). As a chronic condition with progressive cognitive decline over time, changes in the NIP, e.g., TNFalpha levels, are likely less pronounced but more sustained in AD than with acute LPS treatment. Therefore, the lower TNFalpha levels with oAbeta compared to LPS, potentially because of lower TLR4 agonist activity, may allow for the future development of long-term mixed glial cultures designed to mimic the AD-NIP. In addition, TLR4 antagonism and p38alpha inhibition may be particularly beneficial forAPOE4carriers, as LPS- and oAbeta-induced TNFalpha secretion is higher forAPOE4thanAPOE3, and TLR4 antagonists and p38alpha inhibitors can decrease TNFalpha levels to baseline for bothAPOEgenotypes. Using the EFAD mice as an AD-Tg mouse model that combines the regulated expression of the h-apoE isoforms with the over-production of Abeta42, we have begun to address the effect ofAPOEon the complex AD-NIPin vivo. One important finding was that not all markers within pro-inflammatory, anti-inflammatory, repair, and immunoregulatory classifications were equally modulated byAPOEgenotype. As an example, anti-inflammatory/repair markers were both lower (IL-10, FIZZ1, SOCS2, SOCS3) and higher (ARG, SOCS1) in E3FAD mice at 6 months when assessed by cluster analysis comparing 6- and 8-month-old E3FAD and E4FAD mice (Fig. 2a). Our current work is focused on further dissecting the NIP, including the signaling pathways that may underlie the differential expression of markers within each class. Our novel data also demonstrate consistently higher levels of genes considered pro-inflammatory (e.g., TNFalpha, IL-1beta) in E4FAD mice compared to E3FAD mice, regardless of age. These markers were low in 6-month-old E3FAD mice and increased by 8 months. The dramatic differences in neuroinflammation between 6 and 8 months in EFAD mice are likely related to the significant increases inAPOE-modulated Abeta pathology that occurs between these time points (manuscript in preparation). Critically, there were lower levels of an anti-inflammatory and repair gene cluster in E4FAD mice compared to E3FAD at 6 months. Through furtherin vivoandin vitroanalysis, an important finding emerged, that the cytokine TNFalpha, and the receptor pathways TLR4-p38alpha and IL-4R might play a key role inAPOE-modulated Abeta-induced neuroinflammation. Targeting TNFalpha may be particularly efficacious forAPOE4carriers, as Abeta-induced TNFalpha levels were higher withAPOE4thanAPOE3 in vitroandin vivo. TNFalpha has been demonstrated to directly inhibit long-term potentiation and synaptic plasticity, to impair insulin signaling in neurons and induce neuronal toxicity (reviewed in Tobinick2009). Furthermore, TNFalpha levels are up to 25-fold higher in CSF from AD patients compared to controls, and correlate with dementia (Tobinick2009). Based on these lines of evidence, anti-TNFalpha therapies appear to be promising candidates for AD treatment. Entanercept is the therapeutic that is furthest advanced clinically. The drug binds to and neutralizes TNFalpha, and has been reported to improve cognition in mild- to late-AD patients in a 6-month, open-label pilot study, a result that is supported in select case reports (Tobinick2009). Although the cellular target of this therapy remains unclear, and may involve cells in the immediate vicinity of the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier, these results are encouraging and support TNFalpha as a potential therapeutic target. Targeting the TLR4-p38alpha pathway may provide a therapeutic opportunity forAPOE-modulated Abeta-induced neuroinflammation. Indeed, select markers associated with TLR4 were higher in E4FAD mice compared to E3FAD mice at 6 months, TLR4 expression was increased from 6 to 8 months in both E3FAD and E4FAD mice, and TLR4 antagonists inhibitedAPOE-modulated oAbeta-induced TNFalpha secretionin vitro. Data from AD patients, FAD-Tg mice, andin vitrostudies conflict on the effect of TLR4 antagonism for AD risk, inflammation, and Abeta levels, which can be broadly grouped into beneficial or detrimental. Evidence for beneficial effects of TLR4 antagonism include: (i) decreased AD risk in individuals expressing a blunted TLR4 signaling polymorphism (Minorettiet al. 2006); (ii) expression of inactive TLR4 in FAD-Tg mice reduces neuroinflammation (Jinet al. 2008); (iii) inactivation of microglial TLR4 signaling prevents Abeta-mediated neurotoxicityin vitro(Walteret al. 2007); (iv) chronic LPS treatment increases Abeta deposition in FAD-Tg mice (Shenget al. 2003; Leeet al. 2008); and (v) TLR4 knockdown in neurons prevents Abeta-induced neurotoxicity (Tanget al. 2008). Evidence for detrimental effects of TLR4 antagonism include: (i) increased AD risk in individuals with a TLR4 mutation that reduces TLR4 expression (Wanget al. 2011); (ii) increased levels of both soluble and insoluble Abeta with genetic inactivation of TLR4 signalingin vivo(Taharaet al. 2006; Songet al. 2011); and (iii) that LPS (DiCarloet al. 2001; Quinnet al. 2003; Herberet al. 2004; Malmet al. 2005; Herberet al. 2007) or a partial TLR4 agonist, monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL), (Michaudet al. 2013) decreases Abeta levels in FAD-Tg mice. As reviewed in sectionNeuroinflammatory receptors in AD, an important consideration is the contribution of TLR4 to Abeta phagocytosis and inflammatory mediator production. One perspective is that when Abeta levels are high over a short-to-mid time frame, TLR4 agonists will further exacerbate pro-inflammatory phenotype and synaptic dysfunction, and therefore TLR4 antagonists are the appropriate strategy. If with longer periods of high Abeta levels there is a general suppression of all glial neuroinflammation, i.e., both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory/repair, and Abeta phagocytosis is suppressed, then TLR4 agonists may reactivate aspects of glial activation (both astrocytes and microglia) and induce beneficial effects, e.g., phagocytosis and an adaptive IL-4R response (seeAPOE modulation of the Abeta-induced NIP: IL-4R signaling). An additional consideration for dissecting the role of TLR4 in AD is the cell- and species-specific expression. Although microglia express functional TLR4, data are conflicting on the expression and activity of TLR4 in isolated astrocyte cultures (Bsibsiet al. 2002; Lehnardtet al. 2002; Solaet al. 2002; Bowmanet al. 2003; Falsiget al. 2004; Carpentieret al. 2005). One confounding factor is the purity of thein vitrocultures, as contaminating microglia may be responsible for the TLR4 agonist-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion directly, and/or through activating astrocytes via paracrine-like signaling. A further issue is whether human and murine astrocytes respond differentially to TLR4 activation. Recent data demonstrate that isolated human and murine astrocytes display differential innate immune activation pathways (Tarassishinet al. 2014). TLR4/LPS activation of isolated murine, but not human astrocytes induces TNFalpha secretion because of a lack of CD14 expression in human astrocytes. Further cell-type- and species-specific analysis of TLR4 agonist-induced signaling pathway activation, including the contribution of paracrine-like signaling between glial cell types, will yield critical information for dissecting the translational significance of these findings. Data for p38alpha appear more straightforward as a therapeutic, as p38alpha inhibition with MW181 reduces brain pro-inflammatory cytokine production after LPS administration and attenuates synaptic dysfunction in an AD-relevant mouse model (Wattersonet al. 2013; Bachstetteret al. 2014). Pre-clinical therapeutic studies are needed to clarify the role of the TLR4-p38alpha pathway on AD-like pathology, including addressing confounding factors that influence overall efficacy of TLR4 agonists or antagonists such as length of treatment, time of treatment, and the incorporation of h-APOE. Differential activation of the IL-4R pathway may also significantly underlieAPOEgenotype-specific Abeta-induced neuroinflammation, as markers associated with the IL-4R pathway were lower in E4FAD mice compared to E3FAD mice at 6 months, and IL-4R expression decreased in E3FAD mice from 6 to 8 months. TLR4 and IL-4R exert opposing functions in peripheral inflammation. In peripheral macrophages, TLR4 activation induces a pro-inflammatory response leading to tissue damage, whereas IL-4R activation induces a response associated with cellular proliferation and repair (Mantovaniet al. 2004; Benoitet al. 2008). Importantly, evidence indicates that TLR4 and IL-4R also exert opposing effects on neuroinflammation. Peripheral LPS injection results in a TLR4-mediated pro-inflammatory response in the CNS, countered by increased microglial IL-4R expression in young mice (Fennet al. 2012). Furthermore, the adaptive IL-4R response is diminished in old mice (Fennet al. 2012), data that are significant as age is the greatest non-genetic AD risk factor. The products of IL-4R signaling play a number of important functions that may be relevant for the CNS. For example, IL-4/IL-4R signaling decreases NO levels through increasing Arg1, which competitively inhibits iNOS for arginine metabolism (Coltonet al. 2004,2006), and also increases the production of polyamines, proline, and ornithines that increase matrix deposition and promote a repair function in the CNS (Munder2009). However, whether the increased levels of Arg1 are beneficial or detrimental in AD pathology remains unclear, particularly as Arg1 levels are reportedly higher in AD patients compared to controls (Coltonet al. 2004,2006). In addition,in vitro, IL-4/IL-4R signaling suppresses LPS-induced TNFalpha secretion by astrocytes, and conditioned media from IL-4 activated astrocytes and microglia promotes neuronal viability (Gadaniet al. 2012). In terms of modulating Abeta levels, IL-4 has been demonstrated to both decrease (Gadaniet al. 2012) and increase Abeta levels (Chakrabartyet al. 2012) in FAD-Tg mice, conflicting data that is subject to the same issues as TLR4. The data presented here indicate that in response to Abeta, lower IL-4R expression and/or signaling may impart a lower anti-inflammatory and repair response withAPOE4. However, as described, this is a relatively simplistic description of the data and it is clear that there is a more complex interplay between and across NIP markers. For example, although IL-4R expression was decreased from 6 to 8 months in E3FAD mice, SOCS2 and SOCS3 expression was increased, despite the fact that both cytokines are produced by IL-4R signaling in the periphery (Rattheet al. 2007). For virtually every function linked toAPOEin AD, there is the unresolved question of whether apoE4 or all the h-apoE isoforms represent a toxic gain of function or loss of positive function. To dissect this issue requires a comparison among mice or cells that express theAPOEgenotypes andAPOE-KO. Overall, if apoE4 is a toxic gain of function for a detrimental neuroinflammatory response, e.g., LPS-induced TNFalpha secretion, then the expected result would be:APOE4 greater than APOE-KO, i.e.,APOE4is detrimental compared to a lack ofAPOE. If apoE4 is a loss of positive function then the expected result would be:APOE-KO greater than = APOE4i.e.,APOE4is neutral or beneficial compared to noAPOE. Ourin vitrodata suggest that for neuroinflammation, apoE4 is a relative loss of positive function compared to apoE3. Indeed, in mixed glial cultures isolated fromAPOE-TR mice andAPOE-KO mice, both oAbeta and LPS-induced TNFalpha secretion follows the order from highest to lowest:APOE-KO greater than APOE4 greater than APOE3 greater than APOE2, consistent with LPS ICV injection data inAPOE-TR andAPOE-KO mice (Zhuet al. 2012). These data support that apoE4 is anti-inflammatory compared to the absence of apoE, but less anti-inflammatory than apoE3. However, the overall effect ofAPOE4on any given CNS-specific measure will be the product of multiple overlapping mechanisms. Thus, caution remains critical in determining whetherAPOEgene inactivation or therapies that correct the loss of positive function related to apoE4, are the appropriate therapeutic response. How the apoE isoforms modulate neuroinflammation is likely not through a single mechanism, but the combination of multiple pro- and anti-inflammatory processes. One potential pathway is apoE isoform-specific effects on non-inflammatory functions, such as the increased Abeta levels that occur withAPOE4 in vivo. Although modulation of Abeta levels will contribute to theAPOE-modulated NIP, TLR4/LPS-induced neuroinflammation is also apoE isoform-specific, highlighting a pathway(s) independent of Abeta levels. Based on published and the data presented herein, we propose the hypothesis that apoE modulates inflammation through receptor signaling pathways. Specifically, impaired apoE4 function compromises apoE receptor activation, modulating Abeta-induced effects on inflammatory receptor signaling, specifically causing amplification of detrimental (TLR4-p38alpha), and suppression of beneficial (IL-4R-nuclear receptor) pathways, resulting in an adverse NIP that causes neuronal dysfunction (Fig. 4). ApoE isoform-specific functional effects could be mediated through structural differences including lipidation, and/or apoE levels. As the protein component of apolipoproteins, apoE function is, in part, modulated by lipidation (Fisher Ryan1999; Dergunovet al. 2000; LaDuet al. 2006; Taiet al. 2014a,b). Recent data support the long-held belief that apoE4-containing CNS lipoproteins are less lipidated than apoE3-containing CNS lipoproteins (Youmanset al. 2012; Boehm-Cagan Michaelson2014; Taiet al. 2014a,b), reducing the stability of apoE4 (Hirsch-Reinshagenet al. 2004; Wahrleet al. 2004) and resulting in reduced apoE4 levels (Riddellet al. 2008; Viteket al. 2009; Sullivanet al. 2011; Cruchagaet al. 2012; Youmanset al. 2012; Martinez-Morilloet al. 2014). In addition, cellular recycling of apoE4 is impaired (Chenet al. 2010) contributing to the lower apoE4 levels. The different structural properties and lower levels of apoE4, compared to apoE3, may result in effects on apoE receptor activation, including lower apoE receptor-binding and agonist activity. Thus, an important consideration is whether the apoE isoforms differentially bind to apoE receptors. In the periphery, apoE2 binds with lower affinity to LDLR and LRP1 compared to apoE3 and apoE4 (Weisgraberet al. 1982; Mahleyet al. 2009; Hauseret al. 2011). These data potentially conflict with ourin vitrodata that apoE2 suppresses both LPS and oAbeta-induced TNFalpha secretion to a greater extent than apoE3 and apoE4, as well as our stated hypothesis. Therefore, it is important to determine whether the apoE isoforms differentially bind to the LDLR family using CNS-relevant apoE-containing lipoproteins and cell types. For example, apoE binds to heparin sulfate proteoglycans, to facilitate receptor dependent and independent (Mahley Ji1999) uptake of apoE. These processes are likely apoE isoform specific and dependent on the cell type (Weisgraberet al. 1982; Mahleyet al. 2009; Hauseret al. 2011). Indeed, extracellular matrix in the CNS is extensive and complex, includes a high content of heparin sulfate proteoglycans, and its composition varies with cell type. Thus, it is difficult to predict receptor-binding affinity for apoE receptors in the CNS based on results primarily using non-CNS apoE-containing lipoproteins/lipid particles and fibroblast cells (Weisgraberet al. 1982; Mahleyet al. 2009; Hauseret al. 2011). In addition to agonist activity, the apoE isoforms may differentially modulate apoE receptor levels. In neurons, apoE4 impairs apoE receptor recycling, resulting in lower apoE receptor levels (Chenet al. 2010). This will likely have a paracrine-like effect on glia via changes in neuronal derived factors. Importantly, similar processes may occur in glia, thus the apoE isoforms may directly modulate apoE receptor signaling pathway interactions with Abeta-induced neuroinflammatory receptors. TLR4 and IL-4R are two inflammatory receptors that may be modulated by apoE receptor signaling, as there is significant potential signaling pathway overlap particularly with the apoE receptors LRP1 and LDLR (Fig. 4). In vitro, apoE signaling (apoE3 greater than apoE4) via the apoE receptors may suppress Abeta-induced activation of the TLR4-p38alpha pathway. In vitro, cytokines associated with TLR4 activation are higher in E4FAD compared to E3FAD mice, at 6 months (Fig. 2c), oAbeta-induced TNFalpha secretion isAPOEgenotype-specific (apoE4 greater than apoE3) (Fig. 3b), and LPS- and Abeta-induced TNFalpha secretion is inhibited by TLR4 antagonists and p38alpha inhibitors (Fig. 3d and e; Bachstetteret al. 2014). For the IL-4R, apoE may modulate pathways that converge on nuclear receptor signaling (Fig. 4). IL-4R signaling is linked to the JAK-STAT-nuclear receptor pathway (e.g., PPARgamma, RXR, LXR) in the periphery, and nuclear receptor agonists suppress pro-inflammatory and increase anti-inflammatory/repair markers in FAD-Tg mice (Xuet al. 2005; Lefterovet al. 2007; Zelceret al. 2007; Cherryet al. 2014; Skerrettet al. 2014; Spillmannet al. 2014). Specific to apoE, our data demonstrate that in E4FAD mice, markers of IL-4R signaling (Fig. 3a) and the expression of nuclear receptors (PPARgamma, RXR, LXR) were lower compared to E3FAD mice (Taiet al. 2014a). Furthermore, chronic neuroinflammation caused by Abeta and age may exacerbate the apoE4 loss of positive function that results in the higher suppression of IL-4R signaling compared to apoE3. Indeed, increasing Abeta pathology leads to lower expression of nuclear receptors, an effect greater in E4FAD compared to E3FAD mice (Taiet al. 2014a), IL-4R expression was decreased from 6 to 8 months in E3FAD mice, and the IL-4R response was lower in old versus young mice (Fennet al. 2012). Thus, activating apoE receptors, e.g., by apoE mimetic peptides (Viteket al. 2012), and/or targeting the inflammatory receptor pathways modulated by apoE and Abeta may represent promising therapeutic strategies. The apoE isoform-specific modulation of cellular apoE receptor binding/activation (e.g., LRP1, LDLR) and effects on downstream signaling pathways remain unclear (Phillips2014). As presented in Fig. 4, this hypothesis is designed to spark debate and further research in this largely overlooked and complicated field (Michaelson2014). The complex nature of chronic neuroinflammation has resulted in conflicting data surrounding whether any specific inflammatory mediator or receptor is beneficial or detrimental for AD progression, and incorporatingAPOEinto the equation amplifies this complexity. We have begun to address the role ofAPOEin Abeta-induced neuroinflammation, and have identified TLR4 and IL-4R responses as critical pathways. However, further research into this topic is sorely needed based on the proposed central role of neuroinflammation in AD and the 12-fold increased risk for AD withAPOE4(Vergheseet al. 2011). We propose a number of future research directions to enable a deeper understanding ofAPOE-modulated neuroinflammation in AD. The first, and most critical, is to identify theAPOE-specific NIP in Abeta-relevant models and in AD patients across disease progression. An additional aspect of this approach is to assess the extent thatin vitroandin vivomodels recapitulate the NIP during aging and AD progression in humans. Furthermore, developing an AD-relevantin vitromodel of chronic neuroinflammation that incorporates astrocyte-microglia-neuron interactions and, as technology evolves, other inflammatory cell types such as components of the neurovascular unit (e.g., pericytes, BECs), is vital for mechanistic studies. This approach will delineate whether apoE isoforms modulate predisposition, amplification, and/or the adaptive response as chronic neuroinflammation progresses. Furthermore, for individual or groups of markers, it is important to determine conceptually whetherAPOE4accelerates or imparts a differential multiphasic NIP compared toAPOE3. In addition, dissecting how and through which pathways apoE modulates neuroinflammation and the functional consequences for neuronal function may ultimately lead toAPOEgenotype-specific therapeutics.
