Cyanobacteria are well known as sources of cytotoxins and have yielded medicinally relevant metabolites with antiproliferative and neurologically active properties. NoneMany cyanobacterial cytotoxins are nonribosomally encoded, structurally complex depsipeptides occurring in suites of structurally related analogues. Considerable variation in the level of biological activity among structural analogues is related to differences in substituents and/or absolute configuration, as exemplified by the apratoxinsNoneand grassypeptolides. NoneAccurate determination of the absolute configuration is thus critical, but is made challenging by the biosynthetic incorporation of diverse polyketide-derived segments and nonproteinogenic a- and beta- as well asdamino and hydroxy acids, in cyanobacterial depsipeptides, which stem from the convergence of multiple biosynthetic pathways. NoneA more recent pharmacological theme emerging for marine cyanobacterial peptides is antiplasmodial activity, as reviewed by Peach and LiningtonNoneas well as others, and is of particular interest when accompanied by low cytotoxicity to mammalian cells. Such differential activity of the natural products to parasite versus host cells has been reported for alkynoic linear lipopeptides related to the dragonamides,Nonethe cyclic hexapeptide venturamides,Noneand gallinamideNone(which is identical to symplostatin 4None,None) from Panamanian cyanobacteria. These and other Panamanian marine cyanobacteria have been investigated for their natural products chemistry as part of the International Cooperative Biodiversity Groups (ICBG) project focused on Panamanian biodiversity as a source of tropical disease treatments and antiproliferative agents. The chemical investigation of previously unexplored marine cyanobacteria in Coiba National Park, Panama, is ongoing and to date has yielded the selective HDAC inhibitory santacruzamates from a cf. Symplocaspecies,Nonethe polyketide d-lactone coibacins from a cf. Oscillatoriaspecies,Nonewhich exhibit selective antileishmanial activity, and the potent cancer cell toxin coibamide A. NoneThe latter antiproliferative depsipeptide was reported previously from a field collection of filamentous cyanobacteria identified morphologically as comprising primarily aLeptolyngbyaspecies,Nonealthough the major organism identified by phylogenetic analysis (16S rDNA) in the field collection was more similar to theSymplocatype strains (PAC-10-3, GenBank KC207936)Noneand has been proposed to belong to a new genus. NoneCollections of the same cyanobacterial assemblage have consistently provided relatively high yields of the two new cyclic depsipeptides, companeramides A (1) and B (2), so named to convey their repeated isolation as companion (Spanish "companera") compounds to coibamide, while avoiding their association with a cyanobacterial genus name that may be subject to change. Companeramides A (1) and B (2) show differential activity against chloroquine-sensitive and -insensitive strains of the malarial parasitePlasmodium falciparumwith little cytotoxicity to human cancer cell lines. A marine cyanobacterial assemblage comprising a small filamentLeptolyngbyaspecies, based on morphological analysis, was collected in 2004 by hand using scuba from a reef pinnacle in Coiba National Park, Panama. The alcohol-preserved tissue was extracted with CH2Cl2-MeOH, and the extract fractionated by normal-phase silica gel vacuum liquid chromatography (NP-VLC). In preliminary biological activity profiling, the 100% EtOAc fraction was cytotoxic to NCI-H460 human lung tumor cells with an IC50of 300 ng/mL and also showed preliminary activity in the ICBG panel of antiparasitic assays: malaria (IC506 ug/mL), American trypanosomiasis (IC5035 ug/mL), and leishmaniasis (IC50 greater than 50 ug/mL). RP18solid-phase extraction (SPE), HPLC, and further cytotoxicity testing of this fraction resulted in the discovery of the potent antiproliferative metabolite coibamide A,Noneto which was attributed the preliminary antiparasitic activities observed for the parent fraction. However,1H NMR analysis of the RP18-SPE subfractions indicated the presence of additional, but unrelated, peptidic metabolites in the 70% MeOH-H2O subfraction preceding that containing coibamide A (90% MeOH-H2O). HPLC purification of this more polar SPE fraction has afforded two new cyclic depsipeptides, companeramides A (1) and B (2), subsequently found to be responsible for the observed antiparasitic activity of the parent fraction. Laboratory culture of the 2010 field-collected cyanobacterial assemblage yielded predominantly companeramides A (1) and B (2), with a relatively low yield of coibamide A during the first six months of culture. Microscopic examination of these cultures also revealed that a small-filament cyanobacterium was the dominant organism in culture, over its companion large-filament cyanobacterium. Beyond six months in laboratory culture, this assemblage no longer produced coibamide A, but continued to produce the companeramides, and microscopic examination revealed the presence of almost exclusively small filaments, with only sporadic large filaments in the cultured material (Figure S21,Supporting Information). Subsequently a monoculture of this small-filament cyanobacterium was achieved that could be associated with companeramide production (PAC-10-3 csf1, GenBank KM882611). Phylogenetically, this organism is most closely related to a taxonomically unassigned filamentous cyanobacterium associated with Black Band Disease (FLK9, GenBank EU196364, seeSupporting InformationFigures S19 and S20). Companeramide A (1) yielded a prominent [M + H]+ion by HRTOFMS for a molecular formula of C57H97N9O11, which was supported by NMR spectroscopic analysis. The1H NMR spectrum for1exhibited signals typical for a relatively hydrophobic cyanobacterial peptide metabolite, including fourN-methyl singlets (dH3.14, 3.06, 2.92, 2.69), four NH doublets (dH8.86, 6.92, 6.91, 6.75), nine a-H multiplets (dH4.58-5.26), and numerous overlapped methyl doublets (dH0.77-1.32, Table1). The13C NMR spectrum for1displayed nine distinguishable signals for ester/amide-type carbonyls (dC169.4-174.4), one signal for an oxygenated sp3-hybridized carbon (dC75.4), and two signals at dC83.8 and 68.6, diagnostic of a terminal acetylenic moiety (Table1). The HMBC spectrum displayed prominent three-bond HMBC correlations from the fourN-methyl singlets, permittingN-methyls H3-15, H3-25, H3-42, and H3-52 to be associated with corresponding a-carbons C-11, C-20, C-38, and C-50, respectively. The side chain spin systems of these fourN-methylated amino acid residues were delineated by multiplicity-edited HSQC and HSQC-TOCSY experiments as twoN-methyl valine (N-Me-Val), oneN-methyl leucine (N-Me-Leu), and oneN-methyl alanine (N-Me-Ala) residue. Further analysis of the COSY, HSQC, HSQC-TOCSY, and HMBC experiments identified the regular amino acids alanine (Ala), proline (Pro), and two isoleucines (Ile), as well as hydroxyisovaleric acid (Hiva) (Table S1,Supporting Information). The molecular formula for1dictated a tenth residue comprising C9H13NO. COSY and TOCSY NMR experiments were used to identify a spin system in which a methine doublet of quartets (dH2.51, H-2) was correlated to both a methyl doublet (dH1.31, H3-9) and a second downfield methine multiplet (dH3.97, H-3). This H-3 multiplet was in turn relay-coupled to the signals for three contiguous methylenes (H2-4 to H2-6) and also to an NH doublet at dH6.75 (NH-3; Figure1). HMBC correlations from the distal methylene1H signal (H2-6, dH2.17) to nonprotonated sp-hybridized C-7 (dC83.8) and methine C-8 (dC68.6) signals completed the hydrocarbon chain with a terminal acetylene. Finally, three-bond HMBC correlations from the H3-9 doublet to methine C-3 (dC51.2) and the C-1 carbonyl signal (dC174.3) aided in the establishment of this a-methyl-beta-amino acid as 3-amino-2-methyl-7-octynoic acid (Amoya). Key 2D NMR correlations for (A) companeramide A (1) and (B) companeramide B (2). Despite several closely overlapping a-proton signals (H-17, H-32, H-38, H-44) correlated to overlapped carbonyl signals (C-10, C-31, and C-49) in the HMBC spectrum for companeramide A (1), all nine amino and one hydroxy acid subunits were sequenced from HMBC and ROESY data collected at 700 MHz. Two obvious fragments consisting ofN-Me-Val-1-Ala-N-Me-Leu-Pro (fragment 1) and Ile-1-N-Me-Val-2-Ile-2-N-Me-Ala-Hiva (fragment 2) were assembled by HMBC correlations betweenN-methyl, amide, and/or a-H and the carbonyl13C signals for neighboring residues (Figure1and Table S1,Supporting Information). At theN-terminus of fragment 2, the ester linkage between Hiva and the Amoya residue was defined by HMBC correlations from the Hiva a-H (H-54, dH4.80), Amoya a-H (H-2, dH2.51), and Amoya methyl (H3-9, dH1.31) to the Amoya carbonyl C-1 signal (dC174.3). Finally, it remained to connect fragment 1 and the extended fragment 2. ROESY correlations between the Pro H2-30 multiplets (dH3.84 and 3.76) and the Ile-1 a-H-32 doublet of doublets (dH4.74) corroborated an HMBC correlation from the Pro a-H-27 doublet of doublets (dH4.92) to the overlapped Ile carbonyl C-31 signal (dC170.0). Although HMBC experiments with varying delay times failed to show correlations from the Amoya NH-3 (dH6.75) or a-H to any carbonyl13C NMR signals, a ROESY correlation between the NH-3 signal and dH4.58 (a-H-11) was used to connect the Amoya andN-Me-Val-1 residues to complete the planar macrocyclic structure of companeramide A (1) (Figure1A). MS/MS data for1were consistent with the proposed amino acid sequence (Figure S15,Supporting Information). Companeramide B (2) gave a prominent HRESIMS peak atm/z1056.7013, which was 28 mass units less than the major [M + H]+ion for companeramide A (1) and indicated a molecular formula of C55H93N9O11for2. The1H NMR spectrum for2displayed fourN-methyl amide singlets (dH3.23, 3.06, 2.89, 2.74), four amide proton doublets (dH8.84, 7.48, 7.44, 6.80), and midfield multiplets integrating to 10 a-H (dH3.81-5.40). In the13C NMR spectrum for2there were two signals indicative of a terminal acetylene (dC83.4 and 69.4), as for1, and eight distinct signals for ester/amide carbonyls, one of which was noticeably broad and of relatively higher intensity. Analysis of the 2D NMR data for companeramide B (2), including the COSY, HSQC, HSQC-TOCSY, and HMBC spectra, revealed a similar structural composition to1, with the presence of Amoya, twoN-Me-Val, Pro, Ile, and Hiva residues (Tables1and S2,Supporting Information). The HSQC-TOCSY spectrum for2additionally defined two Val spin systems, each comprising an amide (NH-17 or NH-43), two coupled methines, and two methyl1H NMR signals. Two remaining sets of coupled a-methine and methyl doublet1H NMR signals could be attributed to twoN-Me-Ala residues on the basis of HMBC correlations from theN-methyl singlets at dH2.74 (H3-24) and 2.89 (H3-50) to their respective coupled a-methine signals (dH4.96, H-22; d 5.40, H-48). As in the case of1, the sequential assembly of amino and hydroxy acids in2was complicated due to a number of closely overlapping a-H chemical shifts (H-11 and H-31, H-11 and H-43, H-31 and H-52) correlated to closely overlapped carbonyl signals (C-10, C-30, and C-47) in the HMBC spectrum. In this case, HMBC and ROESY correlations supported a fragment 1 sequence ofN-Me-Val-1-Val-1-N-Me-Ala-1-Pro (Figure1B). Although the order of Val-1 andN-Me-Ala-1 in2was originally in question, when compared to the corresponding second and third residues (Ala andN-Me-Leu, respectively) in1, key HMBC correlations were present from theN-CH3-15 singlet (dH3.23,N-Me-Val-1) to the C-16 carbonyl signal (dC173.4, Val-1), from the a-H-17 triplet (dH4.58, Val-1) to carbonyl C-21 (dC169.8N-Me-Ala-1), and from theN-CH3-24 singlet (dH2.74,N-Me-Ala-1) to the C-25 carbonyl signal (dC171.8, Pro). In addition, MS/MS fragments ofm/z183.11 (b2), 282.18 (b3), and 395.26 (b4) (Figure S16,Supporting Information) supported the assigned fragment 1 sequence for2. This consistent pattern ofN-methylation for1and2is biosynthetically logical. HMBC and ROESY correlations supported an extended fragment 2 for2, in which the Ile present in1was substituted for a Val, providing a sequence of Ile-1-N-Me-Val-2-Val-2-N-Me-Ala-Hiva. Again, the two fragments could be connected by a ROESY correlation between the Pro methylene (H2-29) signal and Ile a-H-31 signal in combination with a HMBC correlation from the Pro a-H-26 signal (dH4.83) to the overlapped Ile carbonyl C-30 signal (dC170.2). Finally, the macrocycle could be closed by a ROESY correlation between the signals at dH7.44 (Amoya NH-3) and 4.72 (a-H-11) together with an HMBC correlation from the NH-3 doublet to the C-10 carbonyl signal (dC170.2) ofN-Me-Val-1. The resulting planar structure of companeramide B (2, Figure1B) was again supported by MS/MS data (Figure S16,Supporting Information). The absolute configurations of the amino and hydroxy acid units in companeramides A (1) and B (2) were determined by both Marfey's methodology and direct chiral-phase HPLC analyses of acid hydrolysates (0.5 mg, 6 N HCl, 110 degrees C, overnight). For each natural product, a portion (ca. 0.25 mg) of the acid hydrolysate was derivatized withN-a-(2,4-dinitro-5-fluorophenyl)-l-alaninamide (l-FDAA, Marfey's reagent) and analyzed by comparative RP18HPLC with FDAA-derivatizedd- andl-amino acid standards. The additional 0.25 mg of each natural product acid hydrolysate was reconstituted with H2O, analyzed by chiral-phase HPLC, and compared with the retention times of authenticR- andS-Hiva standards. For companeramide A (1), anl-configuration for Ala,N-Me-Ala, Pro, and both Ile,N-Me-Leu, andN-Me-Val residues, as well asS-Hiva, was established. The hydrolysate from companeramide B (2) containedl-Pro, twol-N-Me-Val, twol-Val,l-Ile, and bothd- andl-N-Me-Ala, as well asS-Hiva. In order to correctly assign the relative position of thed- andl-N-Me-Ala residues in companeramide B (2), a partial hydrolysis and purification of resulting fragments containingN-Me-Ala was attempted, for subsequent complete hydrolysis and Marfey's analyses. To this end,2(4 mg) was partially hydrolyzed with 3 N HCl, and the product mixture analyzed by LC-MS to identify fragments containing a singleN-Me-Ala residue. A tetrapeptide fragment (m/z413.9) identified asN-Me-Val-Val-N-Me-Ala-Pro from MS/MS data (Figure S17,Supporting Information) was purified from the product mixture and subjected to complete hydrolysis and derivatization withN-a-(2,4-dinitro-5-fluorophenyl)-l-leucinamide (l-FDLA, advanced Marfey's reagent) for analysis. The retention times for the derivatized amino acids from the latter (tetrapeptide fragment 1 of2) corresponded to FDLA-derivatized standards forN-Me-l-Val,l-Val,N-Me-d-Ala, andl-Pro. No other partial hydrolysis fragments could be isolated in reasonable amount for Marfey's analysis; however, assignment of theN-Me-d-Ala in the northern hemisphere (fragment 1) of2ledN-Me-l-Ala to be assigned in the southern hemisphere (fragment 2) of2. The beta-amino acid Amoya present in companeramides A (1) and B (2) was first identified in the molluscan metabolite onchidin,Nonebut has since been reported as a component of several marine cyanobacterial metabolites including ulongapeptin,Noneguineamide C,Noneand malevamide C.NoneWhile the absolute configurations of the Amoya residues in guineamide C and malevamide C have not been determined, those in ulongapeptin were assigned as 2S, 3Sby Marfey's analysis using comparison with a synthetic mixture of C-2 diastereomers (2S, 3Rand 2R, 3R) derivatized with bothd- andl-FDLA enantiomers. The (2S,3S)-configuration was also assigned to the Amoya unit in onchidin based on NOE studies and1H NMR coupling constant analysis; however, the total synthesis of onchidin suggested that a revision of the structure was necessary. NoneTherefore, it was planned to use Marfey's analysis for assignment of the Amoya unit in companeramides A and B, facilitated by the availability of the synthetic 3(R)-amino-2(R,S)-methyloctanoate (Amo) standards. NoneTwo portions of the synthetic material were derivatized separately withd- orl-FDLA to provide HPLC retention times for all four possible Amo diastereomers, with retention times ofl-FDLA-(2R,3S)-Amo andl-FDLA-(2S,3S)-Amo being inferred from the retention times of the enantiomericd-FDLA-(2S,3R)-Amo andd-FDLA-(2R,3R)-Amo standards, respectively. Hydrogenation of each companeramide to reduce the terminal alkyne was followed by acid hydrolysis to release Amo for separate derivatization withd- andl-FDLA. Reported retention times for the four Amo diastereomers using similar HPLC conditions were used to assign the order of elution of the pairs of standards generated in our protocol. For each companeramide, thed-FDLA-Amo product coeluted with thed-FDLA-derivatized (2S,3R)-Amo standard, and similarly thel-FDLA-Amo product coeluted with thel-FDLA-derivatized (2S,3R)-Amo, supporting a 2S,3R-Amoya unit in companeramides A (1) and B (2). Companeramides A (1) and B (2) showed no significant cytotoxicity at 1 uM against four human cancer cell lines (NCI-H460 non-small-cell lung carcinoma, MDA-MB-231 breast adenocarcinoma, SF-295 glioblastoma, and SK-OV3 ovarian carcinoma cells). Instead preliminary antiparasitic activity of the parent fractions led to testing of the two pure compounds against three strains of the malaria parasitePlasmodium falciparumin a fluorescence-based assay. Neither compound was as active as the chloroquine control against the chloroquine-sensitive D6 or chloroquine-insensitive Dd2 and 7G8 strains (Table2, Figure S18,Supporting Information). However, the differential activity between the two companeramides across all strains is noteworthy considering their structural similarity. The chloroquine-sensitive D6 strain was approximately twice as sensitive to companeramide A (1) as the chloroquine-resistant Dd2 and 7G8 strains. In contrast, companeramide B (2) showed comparable activity against the chloroquine-sensitive D6 and chloroquine-resistant strain Dd2, but was about three times less active against the chloroquine-resistant 7G8 strain. The companeramides add to the growing repertoire of cyanobacterial depsipeptides that show some degree of antiplasmodial activity, including dolastatin 10,Nonethe venturamides,Nonecarmabins and dragonamides,Noneand symplostatin 4None(first reported as gallinamideNone). While some of these compounds (e.g., dolastatin 10) are potently toxic to mammalian cells as well as to the malarial parasite, others such as the venturamides and carmabin A show relatively little toxicity to mammalian cells. At the concentrations tested, it is not possible to distinguish any selective antiplasmodial activity for companeramide A (1), although the results for companeramide B (2) suggest potential antiplasmodial selectivity. The requisite testing of2for mammalian cell toxicity at higher micromolar concentrations was not pursued in the interest of saving material for other assays in which the target activity may be more pronounced than the moderate antiplasmodial activity presented here. It is interesting to speculate that related large cyclic alkynoic depsipeptides that are reported to be nontoxic, such as the malevamides,Nonemay possess antiparasitic activity. Noteworthy also is that despite the structural relationship between the companeramides and ulongapeptin, only the heptameric ulongapeptin displays nanomolar cytotoxicity. NoneOptical rotations were measured on a JASCO P-1010 polarimeter. UV and IR data were obtained on a Hitachi U-2000 spectrophotometer and a Nicolet IR100 FT-IR instrument, respectively. NMR spectra were acquired on Bruker Avance 700 MHz and Bruker Avance DRX 600 MHz spectrometers with the residual CHCl3solvent used as an internal standard (dC77.23, dH7.26). LR FABMS and HRTOFMS (ES+) mass spectra were recorded on ABSciex 3200 QTRAP and Waters Micromass mass spectrometers. The isolation of compounds1and2was performed using a Waters HPLC system consisting of two Waters 515 pumps, a Rheodyne 7725i injector, and a Waters 996 photodiode array detector. Marfey's and chiral-phase HPLC analyses were conducted on a Shimadzu HPLC system equipped with two LC-20AD pumps and an SPD-M20A photodiode array detector. General reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich Corp and VWR International. The marine cyanobacterial assemblage (McPhail laboratory voucher number PAC-6/25/04-2) was first collected in June 2004 by hand using scuba from a reef pinnacle off the west coast of Coiba National Park. The material collected for chemical extraction (1 L) was stored in 50% EtOH for transport and then stored at -20 degrees C until extraction. For phylogenetic analyses, subsamples of the field collection (0.5 mL of cyanobacteria in 5 mL of RNA Later solution) were stored at room temperature (rt) and then 4 degrees C before DNA extraction, and live cultures were also initiated. Additional field collections were made subsequently in 2010 (voucher number PAC-10-03) and 2012 (voucher number PAC-7/10/12-1), for chemical and DNA extraction, as well as laboratory culture. DNA extraction of the 2010 RNA Later samples and comparison of the genomic 16S rDNA (rDNA) sequence with the NCBI BLAST database led to the identification of the cf. Symplocastrain,Nonewhich will be assigned to a new genus, "Hyalidium". NoneMonoculture of the small-filament cyanobacterium (PAC-10-3 csf1) associated with companeramide production in the 2010 collection provided material for genomic DNA isolation (GenBank accession number KM882611), and this organism was found to be 99% identical to that of filamentous cyanobacteria associated with Black Band Disease (seeSupporting Information, S19 and S20). Approximately 95.6 g dry weight of the 2004 cyanobacterial collection was extracted repeatedly with CH2Cl2-MeOH (2:1) to produce 5.75 g of an organic extract. The extract was fractionated by normal-phase VLC on Si gel with a stepwise gradient solvent system from hexanes to EtOAc to MeOH, yielding nine fractions. The fraction eluting with 100% EtOAc was cytotoxic (IC50300 ng/mL) to NCI-H460 lung cancer cells and further chromatographed by RP18SPE using a stepwise solvent gradient (MeOH-H2O, 6:4, 7:3, 8:2, 9:1, 100% MeOH and CH2Cl2). The noncytotoxic SPE fraction eluting with 70% MeOH possessed interesting peptide-like1H NMR spectroscopic parameters and was purified further using RP18HPLC (85:15 MeOH-H2O, Phenomenex Synergi Fusion 4 um, 10 * 250 mm, 2 mL/min, UV detection at 216 nm) to yield companeramide A (1, 2.3 mg,tR30.5 min) and companeramide B (2, 5.3 mg,tR21.4 min). colorless oil; [a]23D-140 (c0.6, MeOH); UV (MeOH) ? max(log e) 215 (3.45) nm; IR ? max(neat) 3311, 2963, 2930, 1720, 1628, 1517, 1462, 1231, 1098 cm-1;1H and13C NMR data, see Tables1and S1 (Supporting Information); HRTOFMS (ES+)m/z1084.7395 [M + H]+(calcd for C57H98N9O11, 1084.7386). colorless oil; [a]23D-78 (c0.5, MeOH); UV (MeOH) ? max(log e) 225 (4.06) nm; IR ? max(neat) 3311, 2963, 2930, 1720, 1628, 1517, 1462, 1231, 1098 cm-1;1H and13C NMR data, see Tables1and S2 (Supporting Information); HRTOFMS (ES+)m/z1056.7115 [M + H]+(calcd for C55H94N9O11, 1056.7073),m/z1078.6865 [M + Na]+(calcd for C55H93N9O11Na, 1078.6892). The absolute configurations of the amino acid residues in companeramides A (1) and B (2) were determined by Marfey's methodology. Approximately 0.5 mg of each of companeramides A and B were separately hydrolyzed (6 N HCl at 110 degrees C for 16 h), evaporated to dryness, and reconstituted in H2O (50 uL). FDAA solutions in acetone (0.1%, 100 uL) and 1 N NaHCO3(50 uL) were added to each hydrolysate and heated to 37 degrees C for 1 h. The solutions were allowed to cool to rt, neutralized with 2 N HCl (25 uL), and evaporated to dryness. The residues were resuspended in DMSO-H2O (1:1, 100 uL) and analyzed by RP18HPLC (Waters Symmetry Shield C18column, 3.9 * 150 mm, 1 mL/min, UV detection at 340 nm) using a linear gradient of 9:1 40 mM ammonium acetate buffer (pH 5.2)-CH3CN to 1:1 40 mM ammonium acetate buffer-CH3CN over 60 min. The absolute configurations of the amino acids in the hydrolysates of1and2were determined by direct comparison with the retention times (tR, min) for Marfey's derivatives of authentic standards. The retention times (min) of the FDAA-derivatized a-amino acids in the hydrolysate of1matched those ofl-Pro (12.8;d-Pro, 13.5),N-Me-l-Val (23.2;d-N-Me-Val, 27.5),l-allo-Ile (21.4;l-Ile, 21.2,d-Ile, 28.3,d-allo-Ile, 28.8),l-Ala (12.3;d-Ala, 16.9),N-Me-l-Ala (14.3;N-Me-d-Ala, 16.6), andN-Me-l-Leu (26.6;N-Me-d-Leu, 30.3). The retention times (min) of the derivatized amino acids in the hydrolysate of2matchedl-Pro (12.8;d-Pro, 13.5),N-Me-l-Val (23.2;N-Me-d-Val, 27.5),l-Val (17.3;d-Val, 24.0),l-allo-Ile (21.4;l-Ile, 21.2,d-Ile, 28.3 andd-allo-Ile, 28.8), and bothN-Me-l-Ala (14.3) andN-Me-d-Ala (16.6). Chiral-phase HPLC analysis was used to determine the absolute configurations of the Hiva residues in the two depsipeptides. A portion of the acid hydrolysate of1(0.25 mg) and2(0.25 mg) was reconstituted in H2O prior to chiral-phase HPLC analysis (85:15 2 mM CuSO4-CH3CN; column Phenomenex Chirex 3126 (D), 4.6 * 250 mm, flow 1.0 mL/min, UV detection at 254 nm). The Hiva residue in the hydrolysates of1and2eluted with the same retention time (tR, min) as theS-Hiva standard (40.0) but not that ofR-Hiva (61.7). To assign the position ofN-Me-l-Ala versusN-Me-d-Ala in companeramide B (2), 4 mg of2was partially hydrolyzed in 3 N HCl (2 mL, constant stirring, 100 degrees C); the reaction was monitored by LC-MS at 30 min intervals and was halted after 3 h by cooling to -20 degrees C, after which the acid was removed under high vacuum. The residual hydrolysate was suspended in 75% CH3CN-H2O (100 uL) for LC-MS/MS analysis (ES+) to identify fragments containing singleN-Me-Ala residues. TetrapeptideN-Me-Val-Val-N-Me-Ala-Pro (m/z413.9, 0.1 mg) was purified from the total hydrolysate by RP18HLC using a linear gradient of 5-100% CH3CN-H2O/0.1% TFA over 60 min (Phenomenex Synergi Hydro column, 10 * 250 mm, 2.5 mL/min, 340 nm). Subsequent complete hydrolysis of the tetrapeptide (6 N HCl, microwave irradiation, 1000 W, 50 s) was followed by Marfey's derivatization of the resulting hydrolysate (withl-FDLA) and commercial amino acid standards (withl-FDLA andd-FDLA). In each case, 1 M NaHCO3(20 uL) was added to a 50 mM amino acid solution in H2O, followed by FDLA (1% w/v in acetone, 44 uL), and the reaction mixture heated to 40 degrees C (1 h). The reactions were quenched by cooling to rt and acidification (20 uL of 1 N HCl), before drying under high vacuum and resuspension in 100 uL of DMSO for LC-MS analysis (Thermo Aquasil C18column, 3 * 150 mm, 25-55% linear gradient of CH3CN-H2O/0.1% TFA over 45 min, 1 mL/min, 340 nm, ES+). Column eluent was split ca. 1:500 prior to entrance into the ESI source to optimize ionization. Retention times (m/z[M + Na]+,tRmin) for derivatized residues of the tetrapeptide corresponded to standards forN-Me-l-Val (426.2, 23.55;N-Me-d-Val, 28.00),l-Val (412.2, 19.06;d-Val, 28.40),N-Me-d-Ala (398.2, 18.31;N-Me-l-Ala, 17.84), andl-Pro (ion not identified, 16.34,d-Pro, 19.50). Assignment of the Amoya residues relied on hydrogenation of the Amoya unit in1and2to 3-amino-2-methyloctanoic acid (Amo), peptide hydrolysis, Marfey's derivatization with FDLA, and comparison with FDLA-derivatized synthetic Amo standards. In each case, approximately 0.5 mg of cyclic depsipeptide was dissolved in dry MeOH and stirred over 5% Pd/C under an atmosphere of hydrogen (rt, 18 h). After filtration over Celite, washing with EtOH, and concentration in vacuo, the products (m/z1088, tetrahydro-1, and 1060, tetrahydro-2) were resuspended in 6 N HCl and stirred overnight at 100 degrees C. The acid hydrolysate of tetrahydro-1was derivatized withl-FDLA, as described above, while that of tetrahydro-2was divided into two portions and derivatized withd- andl-FDLA. Similarly, synthetic 3(R)-amino-2(R,S)-methyloctanoate (0.3 mg, in 1:1 MeOH-H2O) was derivatized with each ofd- andl-FDLA for RP18HPLC-MS analysis (50% CH3CN-H2O; Phenomenex Synergi Hydro column, 4.6 * 250 mm, flow 0.2 mL/min, UV detection at 340 nm). Observed elution times of the standards were 9.4 min (d-FDLA-2S,3R-Amo =l-FDLA-2R,3S-Amo), 10.0 min (d-FDLA-2R,3R-Amo =l-FDLA-2S,3S-Amo), 17.4 min (l-FDLA-2R,3R-Amo), and 20.9 min (l-FDLA-2S,3R-Amo), as assigned by comparison to reported elution times. NoneThel-FDLA-hydrolysate of tetrahydro-1provided a small peak at 20.9 min forl-FDLA-2S,3R-Amo, which was supported by retention times of 20.9 min (l-FDLA-2S,3R-Amo) and 9.4 min (d-FDLA-2S,3R-Amo) for the two derivatized portions of tetrahydro-2. Plasmodium falciparumstrains D6, Dd2, and 7G8 were cultured in human erythrocytes at 2% hematocrit in RPMI 1640 containing 0.5% Albumax, 45 ug/L hypoxanthine, and 50 ug/L gentamicin, as previously described. NoneIn vitro antimalarial activity was determined by the malaria SYBR Green I-based fluorescence (MSF) assay described previouslyNonewith slight modification. NoneStock solutions of each test sample were prepared in sterile distilled H2O at a concentration of 10 mM. The sample solutions were serially diluted with culture medium and distributed to asynchronous parasite cultures on 96-well plates in quadruplicate in a total volume of 100 uL to achieve 0.2% parasitemia with a 2% hematocrit. Automated pipetting and dilution were carried out with a programmable Precision 2000 robotic station (Bio-Tek). The plates were then incubated for 72 h at 37 degrees C. After incubation, 100 uL of lysis buffer with 0.2 uL/mL SYBR Green I was added to each well. The plates were incubated at rt for 1 h in the dark and then placed in a 96-well fluorescence plate reader (Spectramax Gemini-EM; Molecular Diagnostics) with excitation and emission wavelengths at 497 and 520 nm, respectively, for measurement of fluorescence. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) was determined by nonlinear regression analysis of logistic dose-response curves (GraphPad Prism software). Cell viability was assessed with a standard MTT assay as described previously with the viability of vehicle-treated cells defined as 100% and coibamide A (30 nM) included as a control cancer cell toxin. NoneAll compounds were reconstituted in 100% DMSO and stored at -20 degrees C until the day of treatment; final concentrations of DMSO never exceeded 0.1%. Human H460 lung and SF-295 glioblastoma cells were from the National Cancer Institute cell line repository, and MDA-MB-231 breast and SK-OV3 ovarian carcinoma cells were from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). All cells were maintained under standard growth conditions and seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 3000 cells per well the day before treatment.
