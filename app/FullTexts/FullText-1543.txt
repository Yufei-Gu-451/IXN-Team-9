Ammonia (NH3) plays a major role in atmospheric chemistry and radiative forcing (HertelNone., 2011). When deposited in sensitive terrestrial ecosystems, NH3/ammonium (None) contributes to acidification and loss of biodiversity (DiseNone., 2011). Exchange of NH3between the atmosphere and vegetation constitutes an important process in the global NH3budget, but very little information is available on how anticipated climate changes will affect this exchange. The magnitude and direction of NH3fluxes between vegetation and the atmosphere are controlled by plant physiological processes in interaction with environmental conditions (SchjoerringNone., 2000;MassadNone., 2008). The fundamental parameters characterizing plant-atmosphere NH3exchange are the stomatal NH3compensation point (None) together with the conductance to diffusion of NH3through the stomata and boundary layers surrounding the leaves (KruitNone., 2010). Both of these parameters can be expected to be modified by future climate changes, including elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), rising air temperature, and more frequent drought periods (FowlerNone., 2009). The NH3compensation point in plants is defined as the NH3concentration in the air within the substomatal cavity at which no net NH3exchange with the ambient atmosphere takes place (FarquharNone., 1980). NH3may be emitted when the atmospheric NH3concentration falls belowNoneand absorbed by plants when the atmospheric NH3concentration is higher thanNone. TheNonevalue reflects the concentration ofNoneand H+in the leaf apoplastic solution as these two parameters control the concentration of dissolved NH3in equilibrium with gaseous NH3within the substomatal cavities (HustedNone., 1996;2000). There is currently very limited data on how atmospheric CO2affectsNone. Theoretically, elevated CO2would be expected to decreaseNonedue to repression of photorespiration, which is a majorNone-generating process implicated in foliar NH3exchange (MattssonNone., 1998;HustedNone., 2002;KumagaiNone., 2011). The more efficient photosynthetic carbon acquisition under elevated CO2will in many cases stimulate plant growth without increasing root nitrogen (N) uptake, leading to an overall decline in plant N status (Taub and Wang, 2008), which would be expected to decreaseNone. In addition, more carbon skeletons, energy and reducing power would be available forNoneassimilation via the glutamine synthetase/glutamate synthase cycle (Forde and Lea, 2007). An uncertain factor in theNonebudget will be how nitrate (None) reduction is affected. Elevated CO2has in some cases been reported to inhibit shootNonereduction in C3species, including barley (BloomNone., 2012), while in other cases the foliar nitrate reductase activity of barley was only slightly suppressed (Sicher, 2001) or was even significantly enhanced (RobredoNone., 2011). Plant-atmosphere NH3exchange is strongly affected by apoplastic pH (Husted and Schjoerring, 1995). When CO2dissolves in water, it forms carbonic acid, which is a weak acid. In addition, photosynthetic CO2fixation leads to intracellular generation of stoichiometric amounts of H+. Elevated CO2would therefore theoretically be expected to decrease the apoplastic pH, assuming a low buffer capacity of the apoplastic solution (Nielsen and Schjoerring, 1998). Very high atmospheric CO2concentrations (1-16%) have been shown to rapidly decrease the apoplastic pH (OjaNone., 1999;SavchenkoNone., 2000). However, transient additions of CO2in the physiologically relevant CO2range (0-800 mumol mol-1) alkalinized the apoplastic solution (HedrichNone., 2001;Felle and Hanstein, 2002). All these studies of elevated CO2exposure were conducted over a short period (minutes to hours). Information is still lacking on whether or not the buffering system of the apoplast can compensate for the pH changes after prolonged exposure to elevated CO2. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of elevated CO2onNoneand relate this effect to N metabolic responses. Our hypothesis was that elevated atmospheric CO2would enhance the capacity forNoneassimilation and therefore decreaseNone. Barley plants were grown in 2mMNoneor 1mM NH4NO3solution at ambient (400 mumol mol-1) or elevated (800 mumol mol-1) CO2for 2 weeks. The apoplastic solution was extracted for determination ofNoneand related to key N pools and N-assimilatory enzymes in shoots and roots. Barley seeds (Hordeum vulgareL., cv. Golden Promise) were germinated at 22 degrees C in vermiculite. After 5 d, uniform seedlings were selected and transferred to opaque 4.5 l cultivation units, each holding four plants. The units were filled with aerated nutrient solution containing 0.9mM Ca(NO3)2.4H2O, 0.6mM KNO3, 0.3mM Mg(NO3)2.6H2O, 0.2mM KH2PO4, 0.2mM K2SO4, 0.3mM MgSO4.7H2O, 0.1mM NaCl, 0.8 muM Na2MoO4.2H2O, 0.7 muM ZnCl2, 0.8 muM CuSO4.5H2O, 1 muM MnCl2.4H2O, 2 muM H3BO3, and 50 muM Fe(III)-EDTA-Na. The pH of the nutrient solution was kept at 6.5-7.5 by addition of CaCO3. The cultivation units were placed in two growth chambers at 380-400 mumol CO2mol-1air, 70-75% relative air humidity, and 20 and 18 degrees C during a 16h day/8h night light cycle with a photosynthetic photon flux density of 500-600 mumol photons m-2s-1during the day. At the three-leaf stage 1 week later (d 7), all the cultivation units were redistributed randomly between the two growth chambers. CO2was maintained at 400 mumol mol-1in one chamber and 800 mumol mol-1in the other. Half of the cultivation units in each chamber received 2mMNone[0.2mM Mg(NO3)2.6H2O, 0.6mM Ca(NO3)2.4H2O, and 0.4mM KNO3] and the other half received 1mMNone[0.1mM Mg(NO3)2.6H2O, 0.3mM Ca(NO3)2.4H2O, and 0.2mM KNO3] and 1mMNone[0.5mM (NH4)2SO4]. Two units with different N forms without plants were placed in each chamber as blank controls (nutrient solution without plants) in order to correct for possible N volatilization and water loss through evaporation from the nutrient solutions. The other conditions and nutrient concentrations were the same as before the CO2treatment. The CO2treatment lasted 15 d. The N concentration in the nutrient solution was checked daily and, based on these measurements, N was topped up or the nutrient solution renewed every 3 d. During every change of the solution, each cultivation unit was weighed and 12ml solution was sampled forNoneandNonemeasurement. Water consumption was calculated on the basis of the difference between water losses in cultivation units with and without plants. All the plants were harvested and divided into shoots and roots at d 22. Two plants from each cultivation unit were freeze dried to determine dry weight and water content. The other two plants were quickly rinsed with deionized water and thereupon immediately immersed in liquid N2. All samples were stored at -80 degrees C and ground to a fine powder in liquid N2before biochemical analyses. Photosynthesis and transpiration were measured at d 21. The youngest fully expanded leaf was placed in the cuvette of a CIRAS-2 portable photosynthesis and transpiration monitor (CIRAS-2 Portable Photosynthesis System; PP Systems, Amesbury, MS, USA). The concentration of CO2in the cuvette was controlled at the level corresponding to that in growth chamber, i.e. 400 or 800 mumol mol-1for the ambient and elevated CO2treatments, respectively, and the other conditions were similar to the growth chamber conditions. In order to assess photosynthetic acclimation, the photosynthesis of plants that were growing at 400 mumol mol-1CO2was also measured at 800 mumol mol-1CO2. The extraction of apoplastic solution was carried out at d 22 after a 6h light period. After rinsing in deionized water, the fully expanded leaves were cut into 2-3cm segments and infiltrated with a 350 mOsm isotonic sorbitol solution (280mM), after which the apoplastic extracts were collected in microtubes by centrifuging at 2000gfor 15min (MattssonNone., 1997). Xylem sap was collected from cut stems for a maximum of 30min. None,None, and amino acids were extracted at 4 degrees C from roots and shoots in 10mM formic acid with 0.25mM alpha-aminobutyric acid as an internal standard for amino acid measurement. After centrifugation at 20 000gat 4 degrees C for 10min, the supernatant was filtered (Qmax syringe filter, 0.45 mum pore size; Frisenette Aps, Knebel, DK) and stored at -80 degrees C until analysis. Nonewas derivatized witho-pthaldialdehyde and measured by fluorometry (WangNone., 2011). Nonewas determined by spectrophotometric detection (HauslerNone., 1994). Amino acids were derivatized by AccQ-Taq Ultra reagent (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) and afterwards measured on an Acquity UPLC System (BEH C18 1.7 muM column; Waters). For analysis of bulk tissue pH, plant tissues were ground in Milli-Q water and the pH recorded by use of a microelectrode (Metrohm, Herisau, Switzerland). Lyophilized samples were used for analysis of total C and N by mass spectrometry in a system consisting of an ANCA-SL Elemental Analyzer (WangNone., 2011). Frozen tissues were ground with a mortar and pestle for determination of nitrate reductase (NR), glutamine synthetase (GS), and glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) activities. For NR, the shoot and root material was extracted in a buffer containing 100mM HEPES/KOH (pH 7.6), 20mM MgCl2, 0.2mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 10 muM leupeptin, 1mM Pefabloc, 10 mum flavin adenine dinucleotide, 0.6% polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (PVPP), and 0.05% casein. The assay was performed in the presence of Mg2+or EDTA in order to obtain the actual and maximum activity, respectively, and the NR activation state (ratio between actual and maximum activity). Shoot and root tissues for assays of GS and GDH activity were extracted in the same buffer solution containing 50mM HEPES/KOH (pH 7.8), 5mM MgCl2, 0.5mM EDTA-Na2, 5mM DTT, 20% glycerol, and 0.6% PVPP. GS activity was measured by incubation of extracts in a reaction buffer containing 100mM HEPES/KOH (pH 7.8), 150mM glutamate, 10mM MgCl2, 15mM ATP, 10mM hydroxylamine, and 2mM EDTA. After 20min at 30 degrees C, stop solution consisting of 8% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, 3.3% (w/v) FeCl3, and 2M HCl was added. NADH-GDH activity was determined in a reaction buffer containing 100mM Tris/HCl (pH 8), 1mM MgCl2, 50mM hydroxylamine, 13mM 2-ketoglutarate, and 0.25mM NADH. NAD-GDH activity was determined in a reaction buffer consisting of 100mM Tris/HCl (pH 9), 1mM CaCl2, 35mM sodium glutamate, and 0.25mM NAD. Total soluble protein in the supernatant of GS and GDH extraction was determined according to the method ofBradford (1976) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. TheNoneat 25 degrees C was calculated on the basis of the apoplastic concentrations ofNoneand H+according to the following equation (MattssonNone., 2009):whereKHandKdare thermodynamic constants of 10-1.76atm l mol-1and 10-9.25mol l-1at 25 degrees C, respectively, Gamma is theNone/H+ratio, andNoneand H+are theNoneconcentration and the proton concentration (H+=10-pH) in the apoplastic extracts. Bulk tissue Gamma values were calculated as the ratio betweenNoneand H+in bulk tissue extracts. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was carried out to test CO2, N form, and their interactions. Duncan's test was conducted to compare the mean values. Elevated CO2increased total plant biomass by 36 and 21% in theNoneand NH4NO3treatments, respectively (P less than 0.01;Fig. 1). The corresponding root/shoot ratios remained unchanged in theNonetreatment but decreased in the NH4NO3treatment (P less than 0.01; data not shown). The total leaf area was increased by elevated CO2(P less than 0.05;Fig. 1), while the water consumption decreased by 8-9% (P less than 0.01;Fig. 1). More water was consumed when plants were supplied with NH4NO3compared with those supplied withNone(P less than 0.01;Fig. 1). Effect of elevated atmospheric CO2on plant weight (dry matter basis), leaf area (LA), and water consumption (WC). The experimental treatments were: ambient CO2and 1mMNone(A-None, open bars), elevated CO2and 1mMNone(E-None, grey shaded bars), 1mM NH4NO3(A-NH4NO3, open hatched bars), and elevated CO2and 1mM NH4NO3(E-NH4NO3, grey hatched bars). Values are means +/- standard error (SE) (n=8). Different letters above columns indicate significant differences (P less than =0.05) between mean values inside same plant organ (shoot, root, or total). In the ANOVA table,*and**denote significant differences atP less than =0.05 andP less than =0.01, respectively; n.s., no significant difference. Elevated CO2promoted a clear increase in net photosynthesis, while stomatal conductance and transpiration decreased (P less than 0.01;Fig. 2). Measurements of net photosynthesis at elevated CO2showed similar rates in plants previously grown at ambient or elevated CO2, thus demonstrating that photosynthetic acclimation had not occurred (Fig. 2a). Plants receivingNonein addition toNoneresponded more to elevated CO2and obtained higher net photosynthetic rates than plants supplied exclusively withNone(Fig. 2a). Effect of elevated atmospheric CO2on (a) net photosynthesis (Pn), (b) stomatal conductance (gs), and (c) transpiration (E). Values are means +/- SE (n=6) measured under similar CO2levels as in the preceding growth period, i.e. ambient and elevated. Net photosynthesis of plants previously grown at ambient CO2was also recorded at elevated CO2. Plant growth conditions and symbols are as inFig. 1. The N concentration in the dry matter of both shoot and root tissues exhibited a remarkable decrease at elevated CO2(P less than 0.01;Fig. 3a). This decrease was similar whether N was supplied asNone(-19% in shoot and -18% in roots) or NH4NO3(-15% in shoot and -22% in roots). The decline in N concentration resulted in a marked increase in the C/N ratio at elevated CO2(P less than 0.01;Fig. 3b). However, due to the increased biomass at elevated CO2, the total N content per plant was not changed (Fig. 3c). Effect of elevated CO2on (a) N concentration per unit dry weight, (b) C/N ratio, and (c) N content. Plant growth conditions and symbols are as inFig. 1. Values are means +/- SE (n=8). Elevated CO2caused about a threefold decrease in the apoplasticNoneconcentration (P less than 0.01;Fig. 4a). At the same time, a small (P less than 0.05) acidification of the apoplastic solution occurred (Fig. 4b). These changes decreased the stomatalNonefrom 2.25 and 2.95 nmol mol-1under ambient CO2to 0.37 and 0.89 nmol mol-1at elevated CO2in theNoneand NH4NO3treatments, respectively (P less than 0.01;Fig. 4c). The corresponding apoplastic Gamma values, i.e. the ratio between the concentration ofNoneand H+in the apoplastic solution, were 230 and 302 under ambient CO2and 38 and 91 at elevated CO2in theNoneand NH4NO3treatments, respectively. Effect of elevated CO2on (a) apoplasticNoneconcentration ([None]), (b) apoplastic pH, and (c) NH3compensation point (None). Plant growth conditions and symbols are as inFig. 1. Values are means +/- SE (n=6). Elevated CO2significantly reduced theNoneconcentration in shoots of plants in theNonetreatment but not in the NH4NO3treatment (Fig. 5a). In the roots, theNoneconcentration increased in response to elevated CO2in the NH4NO3treatment (Fig. 5a). Elevated CO2also led to acidification of the leaf tissues (Fig. 5b). The bulk tissue Gamma value, i.e. the ratio between bulk tissueNoneand H+concentration, decreased significantly (P less than 0.01) from 646 at ambient CO2to 280 at elevated CO2in plants supplied withNone, while in plants receivingNonethe corresponding decrease (P=0.30) was from 667 to 563 (Fig. 5c). Effect of elevated CO2on (a) bulk tissueNoneconcentration, (b) pH, and (c) the ratio betweenNoneand H+(Gamma). Plant growth conditions and symbols are as inFig. 1. Values are means +/- SE (n=8). TheNoneconcentration in the xylem sap was around 1mM and showed a small, statistically non-significant decrease in response to elevated CO2(data not shown). Elevated CO2reduced the xylemNoneconcentration from around 30 to 22mM in plants receiving onlyNoneand from around 20 to 13mM in plants receiving NH4NO3(P less than 0.01). The pH in the xylem sap was around 6.0 in all treatments and showed a small (about 0.2 pH units) increase under elevated CO2in theNonetreatment (P less than 0.05; data not shown). TheNoneconcentration in shoot and root tissues was significantly reduced by elevated CO2(P less than 0.01;Fig. 6a). In addition, the level of soluble (free) amino acids in shoot tissue decreased under elevated CO2, while no significant change was observed in the roots (Fig. 6b). There was no significant effect of elevated CO2on the soluble protein concentration (Fig. 6c). Effect of elevated CO2on (a) bulk tissueNoneconcentration ([None]), (b) total concentration of free amino acids, and (c) total soluble protein. Plant growth conditions are as inFig. 1. Values are means +/- SE (n=6). The actual activity of NR in the shoots was about 45% lower under elevated CO2(P less than 0.01;Fig. 7). Concurrently, the maximum NR activity in the shoots decreased by 55-60%, reducing the activation state from around 45% under ambient CO2to 40% under elevated CO2(Fig. 7). In roots, no significant changes in NR activity were observed (Fig. 7). GS activity was not affected by elevated CO2(Fig. 8), as was also the case for the aminating activity of GDH (NADH-GDH), while the deaminating GDH activity (NAD-GDH) increased by around 15 and 16-34% in shoots and roots, respectively (data not shown). Effect of elevated CO2on (a) NR activity expressed on the basis of fresh weight or (b) per unit soluble protein. Full-length columns represent maximum NR activities (Max. ), while the horizontal line within columns shows actual NR activities (Act.). Filled circles above columns in (a) show the NR activation state. Plant growth conditions and symbols are as inFig. 1. Values are means +/- SE (n=5-8). Effect of elevated CO2on GS activity expressed on the basis of (a) fresh weight and (b) soluble protein. Plant growth conditions and symbols are as inFig. 1. Values are means +/- SE (n=8). Plants exposed to elevated CO2are likely to become N limited as they achieve a faster growth rate (Conroy and Hocking, 1993). The N limitation will cause a decrease in the N concentration or in the levels of N metabolites (Stitt and Krapp, 1999). In order to avoid N limitation, previous studies have explored a very high N supply (more than 10mM N) to grow barley plants (Sicher and Bunce, 2008;RobredoNone., 2011), which is far above physiologically relevant N concentrations in soil solution. In the present study, plants received 2mMNoneor 1mM NH4NO3and the N was topped up or renewed every 3 d. The N concentrations in shoot and root tissues were above 3.8% (Fig. 3) and total soluble protein remained unchanged for all treatments (Fig. 6), showing that the N status of the plants was optimum. Elevated CO2dramatically increased leaf photosynthesis as well as shoot and root biomass (Figs 1and2a). Increased biomass is a general feature of CO2responses in C3crops (KimballNone., 2002). However, the initial stimulation of photosynthesis often gradually declines with prolonged exposure to elevated CO2, a phenomenon known as photosynthetic acclimation (Stitt and Krapp, 1999;Ainsworth and Long, 2005;SeneweeraNone., 2011). This acclimation can mechanistically and quantitatively be attributed to a decline in apparentin vivoRubisco activity (Vc,max) and reduced investment in Rubisco, accompanied by a decrease in foliar soluble protein (Rogers and Humphries, 2000). However, in the present study, the amounts of total soluble protein in shoots were similar at ambient and elevated CO2in both theNoneand NH4NO3treatments (Fig. 6c). Moreover, plants grown at elevated CO2did not show any decline in photosynthesis, as evidenced by the fact that their photosynthesis was similar to that of plants grown at ambient CO2and only exposed to elevated CO2during the short measurement period (Fig. 2a). Increased CO2assimilation at elevated CO2would be expected to stimulate N acquisition in order to match the faster growth rates (KruseNone., 2002). However, declines in N concentration of shoot and root tissues at elevated CO2, accompanied by increasing C/N ratios, are often observed in C3plants (CotrufoNone., 1998;KimballNone., 2002). This decrease may derive from a dilution effect accompanying the faster biomass growth (Taub and Wang, 2008). That dilution was a main factor is corroborated by the fact that the quantity of N per plant, i.e. the product of biomass and N concentration, was not different between plants grown at elevated and ambient CO2(Fig. 3c). It is not clear why a dilution of internal N does not give rise to enhanced uptake capacity by the roots. NoneandNoneuptake by roots is controlled by a number of specific transporters, which are regulated at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels (LanquarNone., 2009;LaugierNone., 2012). These transporters are known to respond to the size of the pool of free amino acids, particularly that of glutamine, which provides a signal that can upregulateNoneuptake when plant N status is insufficient or vice versa (MillerNone., 2008). Plants growing at elevated CO2actually had 30-50% lower concentrations of glutamine in both roots and shoots (data not shown), but this was apparently not sufficient to stimulate N uptake. Noneuptake also depends on energy from mitochondrial respiration. The potential alterations in root respiration by elevated CO2are still poorly documented (Gonzelez-MellerNone., 2004;LeakeyNone., 2009). In the present work, root biomass was increased by elevated CO2(Fig. 1), which may have increased growth respiration at the expense of energy for ion uptake. The signalling pathways involved in this regulation and their interactions with plant growth and C and N metabolism under elevated CO2is an area where further knowledge is required (FoyerNone., 2011). BloomNone. (2010) ascribed the lack of increased N uptake under elevated CO2to decreased capacity for shootNoneassimilation rather than to a direct effect on N absorption. However, provision of N in the form ofNonedid not in the present work result in higher total N uptake (Fig. 3c), suggesting that the lack of stimulation of N acquisition under elevated CO2was not specifically associated withNoneassimilation. The decline inNoneconcentration in shoot and root tissues was pronounced for all plants at elevated CO2(Fig. 6a). Approximately 30% lowerNoneconcentration in the xylem sap at elevated CO2in parallel with lower transpiration rates (Figs 1and2c) indicated that lessNonewas transported to the shoot. In terms ofNoneassimilation, elevated CO2resulted in a marked decrease (45-60%) in shoot maximum and actual NR activities compared with ambient CO2(Fig. 7). This decline may reflect the lower tissueNonelevels promoting degradation of NR transcripts and protein (GalangauNone., 1988) and leading to de-induction ofNonetransporter and NR activities (Stitt and Krapp, 1999). Elevated CO2inhibitedNoneassimilation in leaves of wheat, tomato, andArabidopsis(BloomNone., 2002,2010;Searles and Bloom, 2003). In a recent study,BloomNone. (2012) demonstrated that elevated CO2inhibitedNoneassimilation in eight different C3species including barley, whereas it remained unchanged in three different C4species. This indicates that the mode of C fixation is a main factor determining the response inNoneassimilation to elevated CO2. In the work of Bloom and co-workers, plants were grown at a relatively low N supply ( 1mM N). However, at higher N supplies ( 10mM N), the foliar NR activity of barley was only slightly suppressed (Sicher, 2001) or even significantly enhanced (RobredoNone., 2011) in response to elevated CO2. In the latter case, plants were grown at very highNonesupply (20mM) to ensure that any possible downregulation of photosynthesis resulting from elevated CO2was unrelated to nitrogen limitation. In many plant species, including barley,Noneassimilation predominantly occurs in root tissue when theNonesupply is low ( less than 1mM), and the importance of shoot assimilation increases with increasingNoneconcentrations (AndrewsNone., 1992). Root NR activity only accounted for a small proportion of theNoneassimilation in the present work (Fig. 7). Elevated CO2did not increase the activity of NR in roots, but, due to the relatively large decrease in shoot NR activity, a larger proportion of total plant NR was present in roots (Fig. 7; see alsoKruseNone., 2002,2003). This change in NR distribution may partly alleviate inhibition of shootNoneassimilation under elevated CO2due to reduced availability of NADH and ferredoxin (BloomNone., 2010). Elevated CO2showed a clear negative effect onNone, which declined from 2.25 and 2.95 nmol mol-1under ambient CO2to 0.37 and 0.89 nmol mol-1at elevated CO2in theNoneand NH4NO3treatments, respectively (Fig. 4c). The decrease was derived mainly from lower apoplasticNoneconcentrations, while apoplastic H+concentrations only became marginally lower (Fig. 4a,b). The apoplasticNoneconcentration is controlled by the balance between processes generating and assimilatingNone(SchjoerringNone., 2002). RootNoneuptake is an important process leading to increased shootNonelevels (Mattsson and Schjoerring, 2002) and NH3emission from young barley plants (Mattsson and Schjoerring, 1996). Nonetranslocated from roots to shoots via the xylem sap enters the leaf apoplastic solution and ultimately the leaf cells (Finnemann and Schjoerring, 1999). Elevated CO2caused only a non-significant decrease in the xylemNoneconcentration but markedly decreased the transpiration rate (Figs 1and2c), thereby suppressing the root-to-shootNonetransport and thus lowering the apoplasticNoneconcentration. Photorespiration is quantitatively one of the most important processes generatingNonein young leaves of C3plants (CarvalhoNone., 2011) and repression of photorespiration is widely accepted to explain the decreased foliarNoneconcentration at elevated CO2(GeigerNone., 1999;Sicher, 2001). Suppression of photorespiration has been shown to lead to reduced tissueNoneand decreased NH3emission (MattssonNone., 1998;HustedNone., 2002;KumagaiNone., 2011). However, the decrease in tissueNonewas only observed in shoots receivingNoneand not in the NH4NO3treatment (Fig. 5a), showing the importance ofNonederived from root uptake for bulk tissueNonelevels (Finnemann and Schjoerring, 1999;Mattsson and Schjoerring, 2002). The activity of the mainNoneassimilating enzyme, GS, has been shown to be essential for tissue and apoplasticNoneconcentrations in barley (MattssonNone., 1997). The GS activity did not show a significant response to elevated CO2in either shoots or roots (Fig. 8). This suggests that GS may be not the key factor regulating apoplasticNoneunder elevated CO2. The enzyme GDH was for many years assumed to be involved inNoneassimilation, but seems on the contrary to play a role in the liberation ofNoneby catalysing the oxidative deamination of glutamate, thereby providing carbon skeletons for respiration and oxidative phosphorylation (LabbounNone., 2009). In agreement, elevated CO2did not significantly alter the aminating activity of GDH (NADH-GDH), but significantly increased its deaminating activity (NAD-GDH) in shoots and roots (data not shown). Increasing NAD-GDH activity could be relevant to meet energy requirements forNoneassimilation in competition with CO2assimilation at elevated CO2(BloomNone., 2010). The stomatal NH3compensation point,None, is a central driver in the exchange of NH3between plant leaves and the atmosphere (PersonneNone., 2009;MassadNone., 2010;ZhangNone., 2010). LowerNonein response to elevated CO2will increase the sink strength of plant leaves for atmospheric NH3and reduce the likelihood of foliar NH3emissions. BesidesNone, the actual stomatal NH3flux at a given atmospheric NH3concentration will also depend on the stomatal conductance. This parameter decreases markedly under elevated CO2(Fig. 2b;LeakeyNone., 2009), implying that the reduction inNoneunder elevated CO2will not result in a proportional increase in NH3flux. It is concluded that elevated atmospheric CO2decreasedNonein barley leaves. This reflected a pronounced decrease in theNoneconcentration in the apoplastic solution, while the pH only changed marginally. The primary reasons for the lower apoplasticNoneconcentration were decreasedNoneinput via the transpiration stream and decreasedNoneproduction viaNonereduction and photorespiration. The activity of GS, the first step in the assimilation ofNone, did not increase in response to elevated CO2.
