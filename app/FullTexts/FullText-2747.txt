The hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP450) superfamily of hemoproteins are the principal enzymes involved in human drug metabolism and bioactivation. Over 50 human CYP450 isozymes have been identified; however, members of the CYP2 and CYP3 families have significant importance as they contribute to the metabolism of the majority of drugs. NoneThe most relevant CYP2C subfamily enzymes are encoded by a cluster of polymorphic genes on chromosome 10q23.33, organized as Cen-CYP2C18-CYP2C19-CYP2C9-CYP2C8-Tel. None-NoneAlthough the sequences of these four isoforms are greater than 80% identical, they can have distinct substrate specificities, and together are involved in the metabolism of ~20-30% of all medications. NoneCYP2C19 contributes to the metabolism of a large number of clinically relevant drugs and drug classes such as antidepressants, benzodiazepines, mephenytoin, proton pump inhibitors, and the antiplatelet prodrug clopidogrel. None-NoneCYP2C9 is involved in the metabolism of tolbutamide, phenytoin, S-warfarin, losartan, and numerous anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen. None-NoneSome CYP2C9 substrates overlap with CYP2C8, including arachidonic acid, several non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and retinoic acid. CYP2C8 also plays a direct role in the metabolism of some important therapeutic drugs, including paclitaxel, amodiaquine, troglitazone, amiodarone, verapamil, cerivastatin, and fluvastatin. NoneAlthough variantCYP2C18alleles have been reported,None-NoneCYP2C18 expression is not consistent with a major role in hepatic drug metabolism and specific CYP2C18-substrates have yet to be clearly identified. NoneBoth common and rareCYP2C19,CYP2C9, andCYP2C8variant alleles have been identified in different populations, which are catalogued by the Human Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Allele Nomenclature Committee. NoneMany of these variant alleles encode reduced or complete loss-of-function, and their frequencies can significantly differ between racial and ethnic populations. None-NoneImportantly, the ~390 kb of sequence that encompasses theCYP2Ccluster is in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD),None-Noneindicating that there is a tendency to jointly inherit alleles that confer specific CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2C8 metabolic phenotypes. Previous studies interrogating selectedCYP2Cvariants have identified LD between someCYP2C19,CYP2C9, andCYP2C8alleles in specific ethnic subpopulations;None-Nonehowever, the frequencies of many variantCYP2Calleles and relevant haplotypes remain unknown in most populations. We previously reported the frequencies of importantCYP2C9alleles (*2, *3, *4, *5, *6, *8, *11, *13) in the African-American, Asian, Caucasian, Hispanic, and Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) populations,None,Noneand recently identified the novelCYP2C19*4Ballele in the AJ population that is defined by both gain-of-function [c.-806C greater than T (*17)] and loss-of-function [c.1A greater than G (*4)] alleles on the same haplotype. NoneTo determine the frequencies of additionalCYP2Calleles in these populations, 28 variantCYP2C19(*2- *10, *12- *17, *22) andCYP2C8(*2- *10, *12- *14) alleles were genotyped in 250 DNA samples each from healthy African-American, Asian, Caucasian, Hispanic, and AJ individuals. These results were then combined with the previously reportedCYP2C9data to identifyCYP2Chaplotypes and their multi-ethnic frequencies. These results have important implications for pharmacogenetic association studies involving theCYP2Clocus and are clinically relevant when administering CYP2C-substrate medications. In addition, given the recent interest in clinicalCYP2C19genetic testing for clopidogrel response,None,None-Nonewe determined theABCB1c.3435C greater than TNone-Noneallele and genotype frequencies for all tested populations. Peripheral blood samples from healthy donors who indicated their racial background and gave informed consent for the use of their DNA for research were obtained from the New York Blood Center with IRB approval as previously defined. None,NoneIn addition, blood samples were obtained with informed consent from unrelated healthy 100% AJ individuals from the greater New York metropolitan area. None,None-NoneAll personal identifiers were removed, and isolated DNA samples were tested anonymously. Genomic DNA was isolated using the Puregene(r) DNA Purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two hundred and fifty samples were genotyped for each of the five tested populations (African-American, Asian, Caucasian, Hispanic, and AJ). The designations of all CYP450 alleles refer to those defined by the Cytochrome P450 Allele Nomenclature Committee (http://www.cypalleles.ki.se/). NoneEleven variantCYP2C19alleles (*2- *10, *13, *17) were genotyped using the eSensor(r) 2C19 Test (GenMark Diagnostics, Carlsbad, CA) as per the manufacturer's instructions, and five additional variantCYP2C19alleles (*12, *14- *16, *22) andABCB1c.3435C greater than T were genotyped using a custom multiplexed SNaPshot(r) single base extension assay (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA) as previously described. NoneEight variantCYP2C9alleles (*2- *6, *8, *11, *13) were genotyped using the Tag-ItTM Mutation Detection Kit (Luminex Molecular Diagnostics, Toronto, ON) and PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assays as previously reported. NoneAll 12 variantCYP2C8alleles currently defined by the Cytochrome P450 Allele Nomenclature Committee (*2- *10, *12- *14) were genotyped using an additional custom multiplexed SNaPshot(r) single base extension assay (Applied Biosystems). Multiplexed PCR reactions were performed in 10 mul containing ~50 ng of DNA, 2* PCR buffer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, forward and reverse primers (CYP2C8exon 3: 0.8 muM; exons 4, 5, 7 and 9: 0.6 muM; exon 8: 0.4 muM;Supplemental Table S1), and 2.0 units of Platinum(r)TaqDNA Polymerase (Invitrogen). Amplification consisted of an initial denaturation step at 94 degrees C for 5 min followed by 35 amplification cycles (94 degrees C for 30 sec, 57 degrees C for 30 sec, and 72 degrees C for 1 min) and a final incubation at 72 degrees C for 10 min. Amplicons were digested with 3.0 units of shrimp alkaline phosphatase (SAP) and 2.0 units of Exonuclease I (both from USB Corporation, Cleveland, OH). SNaPshot(r) primer extension reactions were performed in 10 mul containing 1* SNaPshot(r) Reaction Mix (Applied Biosystems), 0.2 muM of each allele-specific primer (Supplemental Table S1) and 3.0 mul of PCR product. Following the recommended thermal cycling, samples were treated with 1.0 unit of SAP, electrophoresed on an ABI Prism 3130 Genetic Analyzer, and analyzed using GeneMarker software v1.95 (SoftGenetics, State College, PA). Representative positive control samples for all identifiedCYP2Calleles were confirmed by bidirectional sequencing (Supplemental Figure S1), and wild-type (*1)CYP2C19, CYP2C9, andCYP2C8alleles were assigned in the absence of other detectable variant alleles. Confirmation of potentialCYP2C19*4Bcarriers was performed by cloning and allele-specific sequencing of a 1.2 kb fragment encompassingCYP2C19*17(c.-806C greater than T) and *4(c.1A greater than G) as previously described. NoneFor each sample, six to ten colonies were propagated and bidirectionally sequenced using M13 and T7 vector-specific primers. All plasmid sequence data were analyzed using Mutation Surveyor software v3.30 (SoftGenetics). Observed genotype frequencies were compared with those expected under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium using the chi2test for each racial and ethnic group. The chi2test was also used to detect overall and pairwise differences in allele frequencies between all tested populations. Pairwise LD between tested variants was assessed using Lewontin's D' and the squared correlation coefficient between allele frequencies (r2) expressed as a function of D'. The expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm was implemented to calculate maximum likelihood estimates of haplotype frequencies assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. All analyses were conducted using SAS/Genetics software (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). TheCYP2C19allele and genotype frequencies are summarized inTables 1and2. All alleles were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p greater than 0.05) and no studied population carried the *4A, *5, *7, *10, *16, or *22allele. The overall across-population difference inCYP2C19allele frequencies was significant for five polymorphic variants (rs12248560 [*17], rs4244285 [*2], rs4986893 [*3], rs17882687 [*15], rs28399504 [*4];p less than 0.02). TheCYP2C19*4Ballele was detected in both the Caucasian and Hispanic populations and confirmed by cloning and allele-specific sequencing as previously described. NoneThe combined frequencies of detected variantCYP2C19alleles were 0.406 (African-American), 0.386 (Asian), 0.304 (Caucasian), 0.296 (Hispanic), and 0.368 (AJ). Based on their observed genotypes, the African-American, Asian, Caucasian, Hispanic, and AJ predicted CYP2C19 metabolic phenotypesNone,NoneNonewere distributed as ultrarapid (3%, 2%, 3%, 2%, 4%), extensive (59%, 42%, 72%, 71%, 67%), intermediate (19%, 44%, 18%, 18%, 18%), and poor (5%, 8%, 4%, 2%, 4%) metabolizers, respectively (Table 2). Some of the variantCYP2C19alleles (*9, *10, *12- *16, *22) in the expanded panel currently do not have clear phenotypic consequences, as do compound heterozygous genotypes that include both gain- and loss-of-function alleles (e.g., *2/*17). As such, the frequencies of individuals with unknown predicted metabolic phenotypes using thisCYP2C19genotyping panel in the African-American, Asian, Caucasian, Hispanic, and AJ were 14%, 4%, 4%, 7%, and 8%, respectively. Some studies have found that clopidogrel-treated patients with cardiovascular disease who are homozygous carriers of the synonymousABCB1c.3435C greater than T (p.I1145I) variant have higher rates of adverse cardiovascular events than c.3435C carriers during therapy, which was independent from and compounded byCYP2C19loss-of-function alleles. None-NoneHowever, conflicting data have been reported regarding which allele (c.3435C or c.3435T) was associated with the increased risk. NoneSupplemental Tables S2 and S3summarize the identifiedABCB1c.3435C greater than T allele and genotype frequencies, which were statistically different between all tested populations (p less than 0.0001). Of note, the c.3435T/T genotype frequencies in the African-American, Asian, Caucasian, Hispanic, and AJ were 6%, 20%, 29%, 24%, and 8%, respectively. In addition, categorizing the tested subjects based onCYP2C19loss-of-function allele carrier status andABCB1c.3435T/T genotypeNoneindicated that 34 - 66% of all tested multi-ethnic individuals carriedCYP2C19andABCB1genotypes that conferred an increased risk for clopidogrel nonresponsiveness and/or adverse effects (Supplemental Table S4 and Supplemental Figure S2). TheCYP2C8allele and genotype frequencies are summarized inTables 3and4. All alleles were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p greater than 0.05) and no studied population carried the *5- *10, *12, or *13allele. The overall across-population difference inCYP2C8allele frequencies was highly significant for three polymorphic variants (rs11572080 [*3], rs11572103 [*2], rs10509681 [*3];p less than 0.0001). The combined frequencies of detected variantCYP2C8alleles were 0.122 (African-American), 0.038 (Asian), 0.130 (Caucasian), 0.116 (Hispanic), and 0.100 (AJ). The African-American, Asian, Caucasian, Hispanic, and AJCYP2C8genotype frequencies were distributed as homozygous wild-type (77%, 92%, 77%, 79%, 80%), heterozygous (22%, 8%, 20%, 20%, 20%), and homozygous variant/compound heterozygous (0.4%, 0%, 3%, 1%, 0%), respectively. After combining theCYP2C19andCYP2C8genotyping results with the previously reportedCYP2C9data, pairwise LD was calculated and visualized using Haploview version 4.1 for each racial and ethnic group (Figure 1). Using 13 polymorphic alleles [CYP2C19*2, *3, *4, *17;CYP2C9*2, *3, *5, *8, *11;CYP2C8*2, *3(p.R139K), *3(p.K399R), *4], 33, 18, 19, 22, and 23 non-redundantCYP2Chaplotypes were inferred in the African-American, Asian, Caucasian, Hispanic, and AJ populations, respectively. However, only 16 of all identified haplotypes had frequencies greater than 0.5% in at least one population and together accounted for ~96 - 99% of the overallCYP2Ccluster haplotypic diversity in these populations (Table 5). Estimated haplotype frequencies showed considerable variation across the five populations and some of the commonly studiedCYP2C19,CYP2C9andCYP2C8functional variants were found to exist in more than one haplotype. The two most common variant allele-containing haplotypes were2C19*2-2C9*1-2C8*1(12 - 27%) and2C19*17-2C9*1-2C8*1(6 - 19%). Importantly, a2C19*17-2C9*1-2C8*2haplotype was also identified among African-Americans (7.5%) and Hispanics (1.7%), indicating thatCYP2C19*17does not always tag aCYP2Chaplotype that encodes efficient CYP2C-substrate metabolism as previously reported in Nordic populations. NoneThe estimated D' andrNonebetween2C19*17and2C8*2were 0.813 and 0.325 among African-Americans, and 0.626 and 0.057 among Hispanics, respectively (Table 6). In addition, a haplotype containing twoCYP2Closs-of-function alleles (2C19*1-2C9*2-2C8*3) was identified in all populations (1.2 - 8.9%) except African-Americans. Unique ethnic-specific and/or rare haplotypes were also detected at frequencies of 0.5 - 4.8%, including2C19*3-2C9*1-2C8*1(Asians),2C19*4B-2C9*1-2C8*1(AJs),2C19*2-2C9*1-2C8*4(African-Americans and AJs), and2C19*1-2C9*3-2C8*3(Asians and AJs). The paucity of frequency data for variantCYP2C19andCYP2C8alleles beyond those commonly tested (e.g., *2and *3) prompted our genotyping of 28 functional and/or coding region variants (CYP2C19*2- *10, *12- *17, *22; CYP2C8*2- *10, *12- *14) in the African-American, Asian, Caucasian, Hispanic, and AJ populations. Although not all alleles were detected, the combined variantCYP2C19allele frequencies ranged from ~0.30 - 0.41 in the tested populations; however, the combinedCYP2C8frequencies were much lower (~0.04 - 0.13). After combining these results with our previously reportedCYP2C9data (36 total variants),None16 uniqueCYP2Chaplotypes were inferred in the tested populations with frequencies greater than 0.5%. Our haplotype data indicate thatCYP2C19*17does not always tag aCYP2Chaplotype encoding efficient CYP2C-substrate metabolism as previously reported in Nordic populationsNoneand highlight that, despite largely acting as independent loci,CYP2C19*17and *2can also be found in LD with other variantCYP2Calleles that influence the metabolizer phenotypes. The firstCYP2C19loss-of-function allele discovered based on its role in impaired mephenytoin metabolism was *2(c.681G greater than A),Noneand since then a number of additional variants have been identified in different populations. Some have known effects on CYP2C19 enzyme activity, whereas others do not have clear phenotypic effects. None,NoneConsequently, our study using an expanded panel of 16CYP2C19variant alleles identified individuals with certain genotypes (e.g., *1/*15, *2/*17) that have unknown consequences on CYP2C19-mediated drug metabolism. The identified frequencies of individuals with unknown predicted metabolizer phenotypes ranged from 4 - 14% in the tested populations (highest in African-Americans), suggesting that furtherin vivoand/orin vitrophenotyping studies with these specific variant alleles are warranted prior to their inclusion in clinical genotyping panels. CYP2C19 poor metabolizers typically carry two loss-of-function alleles and the frequencies of these genotypes ranged from ~2 - 8% in the tested populations, which was highest in Asians due to their higher frequencies of both *2and *3. CYP2C19 has recently received considerable attention due to its principal role in the bioactivation of the antiplatelet agent clopidogrel. Importantly,CYP2C19loss-of-function alleles have been associated with lower active metabolite exposure,None-Nonedecreased platelet responsivenessex vivoamong clopidogrel-treated subjects,None-Noneand increased adverse cardiovascular event rates among clopidogrel-treated patients with acute coronary syndromes and/or those undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. None-None,None-NoneThe increased risk amongCYP2C19loss-of-function allele carriers, particularly for poor metabolizers, prompted product insert label revision by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and additional interest in implementingCYP2C19clinical testing to guide antiplatelet therapy for some cardiovascular patient populations. None,None,None-NoneRecently, theCYP2C19*4Ballele was discovered in the AJ population which has important implications for clinicalCYP2C19testing as the allele harbors both gain-of-function [c.-806C greater than T (*17)] and loss-of-function [c.1A greater than G (*4)] variants on the same haplotype. NoneIn the current study,CYP2C19*4Bwas also identified in both the Caucasian and Hispanic populations at lower frequencies ( less than =1%); however, no carriers of the *4Aallele (c.1A greater than G without c.-806C greater than T) were detected in any of the tested populations. Importantly, we previously identifiedCYP2C19*4Ain the Sephardic Jewish population,Nonewhich confirms the independent existence of these two sub-alleles. Although more controversial thanCYP2C19, some studies have found that carriers of theABCB1(P-glycoprotein) c.3435C greater than T synonymous variant have higher rates of adverse cardiovascular events during clopidogrel therapy,None-None,Nonesuggesting thatABCB1might influence clopidogrel efflux and drug bioavailability. However, conflicting data have been reported regarding both the relationship between c.3435C greater than T and P-glycoprotein expressionNone-Noneand which allele (c.3435C or c.3435T) is associated with the increased cardiovascular risk. NoneDespite this discrepancy, large clinical studies found that c.3435T/T patients had a higher rate of adverse cardiovascular events than c.3435C homozygotes during clopidogrel therapy, which was independent from and compounded byCYP2C19loss-of-function alleles. None-NoneOur study identified a high frequency of c.3435T/T homozygotes in the tested populations (6 - 30%), and when combined with theCYP2C19variant frequencies, 34 - 66% of tested individuals harbored aCYP2C19loss-of-function allele and/orABCB1c.3435T/T, which could influence their response to clopidogrel. CYP2C8 is involved in the metabolism of a number of drugs and xenobiotics including arachidonic acid, repaglinide, and the anticancer agent paclitaxel. None-NoneAlthough earlyin vitrodata suggested thatCYP2C8*2and *3resulted in impaired activity and decreased metabolism of CYP2C8 substrates, somein vivodata on the phenotypic consequences of these alleles have yielded contradictory results. None-NoneMoreover, the effects of the known variantCYP2C8alleles on activity may be substrate specific. NoneWe genotyped all 12 currently defined variantCYP2C8alleles (*2- *10, *12- *14) and only detected *2, *3, *4and *14in the tested populations. All other alleles were originally discovered at low frequencies in Japanese individuals,None-Nonewhich may have been an underrepresented ethnicity in our heterogeneous Asian population. Together, these results suggest that futureCYP2C8pharmacogenetic studies could benefit from additional genotype-phenotype correlation data, and furtherCYP2C8sequencing of phenotype outliers in different racial and ethnic populations. TheCYP2C9*2(p.R144C) reduced function allele previously was found linked withCYP2C8*3in the Swedish population,Noneunderscoring the strong LD across theCYP2Cregion. None-NoneThis finding highlighted the possibility of jointly inheriting multipleCYP2Creduced function alleles on individual haplotypes, which has important implications for the metabolism of common CYP2C9 and CYP2C8 substrates (e.g., arachidonic acid, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, etc.). Global variation inCYP2C9-CYP2C8haplotype frequencies, including the2C9*2-2C8*3haplotype, has been reported in other worldwide populations,Noneand very recent reports have extended these haplotype studies to includeCYP2C19in selected populations. None-NoneFor example, in Nordic populations, theCYP2C19*17gain-of-function allele was found almost exclusively with wild-typeCYP2C9*1andCYP2C8*1. NoneHowever,CYP2C19*17subsequently was reported in LD withCYP2C8*2among Brazilian individuals of African descent, prompting these authors to conclude that further multi-ethnicCYP2Chaplotype studies includingCYP2C19*17were warranted. NoneInterrogating 36 variantCYP2Calleles in five major racial and ethnic populations resulted in 16 inferredCYP2Chaplotypes with frequencies greater than 0.5% in our study. Of note, the2C19*1-2C9*2-2C8*3haplotype was identified in all racial and ethnic groups except African-Americans. In contrast, the aforementioned2C19*17-2C9*1-2C8*2haplotype reported among Brazilians of African descentNonewas identified in both our African-American (8%) and Hispanic (2%) populations. As Hispanics can be three-way admixtures of Native American, European and West African populations,Noneour data underscore thatCYP2C19*17should not be used as a sole determinant for extensive CYP2C substrate metabolism in populations with African descent. NoneHowever,2C19*17-2C9*1-2C8*1was the more commonCYP2C19*17-containing haplotype among all carriers of this variant allele (African-American: 9%; Asian: 6%; Caucasian: 15%; Hispanic: 13%; AJ: 19%). Notably, despite the identification of the2C19*17-2C9*1-2C8*2haplotype,CYP2C19*17still appears to be a marker of extensive CYP2C9 metabolism, which may be more clinically relevant than CYP2C8-mediated drug metabolism. Other novel haplotypes with multiple variants included2C19*2-2C9*1-2C8*4in the African-American and AJ populations, and2C19*1-2C9*3-2C8*3in the Asian and AJ populations. In addition, the2C19*3-2C9*1-2C8*1and2C19*4B-2C9*1-2C8*1haplotypes were found exclusively in the Asian and AJ populations, respectively. Together, these haplotype results are consistent with those previously reported in selected ethnic populations using fewer alleles and extend their findings by identifying both known and novel rareCYP2Chaplotypes in other major racial and ethnic groups. Given the vast ethnic diversity prevalent among the Asian racial group, futureCYP2Chaplotype studies that include additional and more clearly defined ethnic Asian subpopulations are warranted. In addition, future haplotype studies are warranted as novelCYP2Cvariants with clinical relevance are identified. For example, an intronicCYP2C9polymorphism (rs7089580) was recently associated with warfarin dose variability in the African-American population; however, it is currently unclear if it is a functional non-coding variant with a role in gene transcription or if it is in LD with another functionalCYP2C9variant. NoneAs future studies establish which sequence variant of this potentially novelCYP2C9allele is functionally relevant, it will be important to include it inCYP2Chaplotype studies of the African-American and other populations. These studies could be instructive for the warfarin pharmacogenetics field asCYP2Chaplotypes with loss-of-function variants in bothCYP2C9andCYP2C19could influence dosing variability by affecting S- and R-warfarin pharmacokinetics, respectively. Although the relationship betweenCYP2C9loss-of-function alleles and impaired S-warfarin metabolism is well established, a very recent study has reported an association between aCYP2C19promoter variant (rs3814637) and R-warfarin clearance. NoneIn conclusion, our study determined the frequencies of 28 variantCYP2C19andCYP2C8alleles in the African-American, Asian, Caucasian, Hispanic and AJ populations, which highlight the polymorphic nature ofCYP2C19compared toCYP2C8in all tested populations. Additionally, the recently describedCYP2C19*4Ballele, originally discovered in the AJ population, was identified in the Caucasian and Hispanic populations. Combining all genotyping results with our previousCYP2C9data allowed forCYP2Chaplotype structure analyses on all populations, which identified both previously reported and novel haplotypes. Taken together, these results have important implications for pharmacogenomic association studies involving theCYP2Clocus and are clinically relevant when administering CYP2C-substrate medications.
