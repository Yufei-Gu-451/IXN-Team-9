Obesity and diabetes remains one of the leading causes of death in developed countries. Importantly, a variety of metabolic abnormalities have been linked to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR) (1-3). In particular, genetically obese mice exhibit ER stress and activation of the UPR in the periphery as well as in the central nervous system (CNS) (4,5). Moreover, nutrient-dependent regulation of the UPR has been suggested to be a major contributor to diet-induced metabolic dysfunction within the periphery as well as the brain (4,6-8). The inositol-requiring enzyme 1/X-box binding protein 1 (Ire1-Xbp1) pathway is the most conserved of the three branches of the UPR (9-13). Activated Ire1 exhibits endoribonuclease activity, which cleaves its primary target, the mRNA encodingXbp1, and generates a potent transcription factor that stimulates expression of chaperones and components of the ER-associated protein degradation pathway (9). Although global deletion ofIre1orXbp1in mice produces an embryonic lethal phenotype (14-16), neuronal deletion ofXbp1creates severe ER stress in the hypothalamus, blocks leptin action, and generates leptin resistance in mice (4). (Note that Xbp1 deletion causes Ire1 hyperactivation, which leads to cell death.) Similarly, chemical activation of ER stress in pro-opiomelanocortin (Pomc) neurons results in acute leptin and insulin resistance via aPtp1b- andSocs3-dependent mechanism (17). Importantly, constitutive activation of the spliced isoform of Xbp1 (Xbp1s) inPomcneurons mimics a postprandial state, resulting in improved body weight and decreased glucose and insulin levels (17). Although driving theIre1-Xbp1spathway in arcuatePomcneurons is sufficient to improve body weight and glucose homeostasis, the requirement of this highly conserved pathway inPomcneurons to regulate metabolism remains to be established. We therefore tested the hypothesis thatIre1signaling inPomcneurons is necessary for proper energy balance and glucose metabolism. Pomc-cre (25) andIre1alphafe/fe(20) mice were group housed (1-5 mice per cage) in a barrier facility at 23 degrees C unless otherwise noted. Male mice in a C57Bl/6 background were used for all studies. Mice were provided a Harlan Teklad 2016 chow diet and water ad libitum unless otherwise noted. Mice were placed on a high-fat/high-sucrose (HFHS; Research Diets D12331) diet at 8 weeks of age, if applicable, and HFHS diet was removed and refilled weekly. Mice losing greater than 10% of body weight during the acclimation period for metabolic cage studies (see below) were not studied. Body composition was measured using nuclear magnetic resonance (Bruker minispec). Experiments were performed in a temperature-controlled room containing 36 TSE metabolic cages maintained by University of Texas Southwestern (UTSW) Animal Resources personnel. One week prior to study, mice were singly housed to acclimate to new housing. Three days prior to study, mice were transported to the room containing the metabolic cages to acclimate to a new environment. HFHS diet, if applicable, was also introduced at the beginning of this acclimation period. After 3 days acclimation, cages were connected to the TSE system for a total of 5 days. Days 2-4 were used for data analyses. Mice were housed in cold chambers maintained at 6 degrees C by UTSW Animal Resources personnel. Sixteen-week-old male mice were anesthetized and transcardially perfused with a modified ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) (126 mmol/L NaCl, 2.8 mmol/L KCl, 1.2 mmol/L MgCl2, 2.5 mmol/L CaCl2, 1.25 mmol/L NaH2PO4, 26 mmol/L NaHCO3, and 5 mmol/L glucose), in which an equiosmolar amount of sucrose was substituted for NaCl. The mice were then decapitated, and the entire brain was removed and immediately submerged in ice-cold, carbogen-saturated (95% O2and 5% CO2) ACSF. Coronal sections (250 mum) were cut with a Leica VT1000S vibratome and then incubated in oxygenated ACSF with tunicamycin (35 mumol/L) for 6 h. The slices were fixed by 10% neural-buffered formalin for 4 h at room temperature and cryopreserved in 30% sucrose at 4 degrees C overnight. Brain slices were then sectioned into 25-mum coronal sections and stored in cryoprotectant at -20 degrees C until use. Brain sections were rinsed with PBS five times for 5 min and incubated with primary antibody (Irealpha, NB100-2323, 1:100 diluted in 3% normal donkey serum, PBS and tween-azide) at 4 degrees C overnight. Sections were then rinsed in PBS and incubated with secondary antibody (1:200 diluted in 3% normal donkey serum, PBS and tween) at room temperature for 2 h. Cells were visualized using a Zeiss microscope by an observer that was blinded to the condition or genotype of the mice. Protein was extracted from brown adipose tissue (BAT) by using RIPA buffer (Boston BioProducts) supplemented with complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). For Western blot analyses, 80 ug protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, transferred, and blotted with the anti-UCP1 antibody (ab10983; Abcam). After an overnight fast, 10- to 14-week-old male mice received intraperitoneal injections of 1.5 g/kgd-glucose. Blood glucose was measured from tail blood using a glucometer at serial time points as indicated in figures. A separate cohort of mice was used for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). Blood was collected at 0 and 30 min after glucose administration. Blood samples were centrifuged, and serum samples were collected from the supernatants. Insulin levels were measured using an ELISA kit (Crystal Chem Inc., Downers Grove, IL) according to the manufacturer's instruction. After a 4-h fast to empty the stomach, 10- to 14-week-old male mice received intraperitoneal injections of insulin (1.2 units/kg for chow-fed mice or 1.4 units/kg for high-fat diet [HFD]-fed mice). Blood glucose was measured from tail blood as described above. After a 6-h fast to empty the stomach, 10- to 14-week-old male mice received intraperitoneal injections of 2 mg/kg pyruvate. Blood glucose was measured from tail blood as described above. Tissues were dissected and fixed in formalin for 48 h at 4 degrees C followed by 50% ethanol. BAT histology was performed with assistance from the UTSW Histology Core. Inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) was performed with assistance from the Harvard Histology Core. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from Pomc-hrGFP (humanized,Renilla reniformisgreen fluorescent protein) neurons maintained in hypothalamic slice preparations and data analysis were performed as previously described (17,18). In brief, 4- to 16-week-old male mice were anesthetized and transcardially perfused with a modified ice-cold ACSF (described below), in which an equiosmolar amount of sucrose was substituted for NaCl. The mice were then decapitated, and the entire brain was removed and immediately submerged in ice-cold, carbogen-saturated (95% O2and 5% CO2) ACSF (126 mmol/L NaCl, 2.8 mmol/L KCl, 1.2 mmol/L MgCl2, 2.5 mmol/L CaCl2, 1.25 mmol/L NaH2PO4, 26 mmol/L NaHCO3, and 5 mmol/L glucose). Coronal sections (250 mum) were cut with a Leica VT1000S vibratome and then incubated in oxygenated ACSF at room temperature for at least 1 h before recording. Slices were transferred to the recording chamber and allowed to equilibrate for 10-20 min before recording. The slices were bathed in oxygenated ACSF (32 degrees C-34 degrees C) at a flow rate of ?2 mL/min. The pipette solution for whole-cell recording was modified to include an intracellular dye (Alexa Fluor 594 or Alexa Fluor 350) for whole-cell recording: 120 mmol/L K-gluconate, 10 mmol/L KCl, 10 mmol/L HEPES, 5 mmol/L EGTA, 1 mmol/L CaCl2, 1 mmol/L MgCl2, and 2 mmol/L MgATP and either 0.03 mmol/L Alexa Fluor 594 or Alexa Fluor 350 hydrazide dye (pH 7.3). Epifluorescence was briefly used to target fluorescent cells, at which time the light source was switched to infrared differential interference contrast imaging to obtain the whole-cell recording (Zeiss Axioskop FS2 Plus equipped with a fixed stage and a QuantEM:512SC electron-multiplying charge-coupled device camera). Electrophysiological signals were recorded using an Axopatch 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices), low-pass filtered at 2-5 kHz, and analyzed offline on a PC with pCLAMP programs (Molecular Devices). Recording electrodes had resistances of 2.5-5 mol/LOmega when filled with the K-gluconate internal solution. Input resistance was assessed by measuring voltage deflection at the end of the response to a hyperpolarizing rectangular current pulse step (500 ms of -10 to -50 pA). Leptin (100 nmol/L, provided by A.F. Parlow through the National Hormone and Peptide Program, Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, Torrance, CA) or insulin (50 nmol/L, Humulin R 100 units/mL; Eli Lilly and Company) was added to the ACSF for specific experiments. Solutions containing leptin or insulin were typically perfused for 2-4 min. A drug effect was required to be associated temporally with peptide application, and the response had to be stable within a few minutes. A neuron was considered depolarized or hyperpolarized if a change in membrane potential was at least 2 mV in amplitude. A coronal slice between bregma -1.22 and -2.70 mm was made from age- and weight-matched mice, and then the arcuate nucleus was microdissected with a scalpel under a microscope. Total RNA was extracted from tissues with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA (1 mug) was converted into first-strand cDNA with oligo(dT) primers as described by the manufacturer (Clontech). PCR was performed in an Mx3000P Q-PCR system (Stratagene) with specific primers and SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Stratagene). The relative abundance of mRNAs was standardized with 18S mRNA as the invariant control. Experiments were done in conscious, chronically catheterized mice using previously described techniques (17). After a 5-day recovery, food was removed on day of experiment at 0800 h to begin a 5-h fast. [3,4-13C2]glucose (Cambridge Isotopes) was infused beginning att= -120 min to calculate glucose turnover. Humulin R (2.5 mU/kg/min) was then infused att= 0 min to induce hyperinsulinemia. Blood samples from the cut tail were taken every 10 min, and dextrose (50%) was infused as needed to maintain target blood glucose levels (?150 mg/dL). Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad. All data were evaluated using a two-tailed Studentttest, with aPvalue of less than 0.05 considered significant. In all instances, data are presented as mean +/- SEM. Body weight curves were compared using a linear regression analysis. Degrees of freedom (DF) fortstatistics are marked ast(DF). For glucose tolerance test, insulin tolerance test, and pyruvate tolerance test (PTT), data were analyzed consistent with current recommendations (19,20). Pre-established criteria for excluding data points were data two SDs outside the mean or any data obtained from mice that died or lost greater than 10% of body weight due to metabolic cage acclimation or clamp studies. The downstream target ofIre1alpha,Xbp1s, improves energy expenditure and glucose metabolism in the periphery as well as the CNS (4,5,17,21,22). In particular, we recently demonstrated that overexpression ofXbp1sinPomcneurons alone was sufficient to protect against diet-induced obesity as well as glucose and insulin intolerance (17). In order to test the requirement of theIre1-Xbp1sarm of the UPR inPomcneurons to regulate body weight, we generated mice that were deficient forIre1alphaspecifically inPomcneurons,Pomc-cre::Ire1alphafe/femice (23). Fluorescent immunohistochemistry demonstrated that pIre1alphacan be detected in the arcuate nucleus (Fig. 1). The cells expressing pIre1alphainclude those identified asPomcneurons as visible by tdtomato expression (Fig. 1None). Notably, Pomc neurons deficient forIre1alpha(Pomcneurons fromPomc-cre::Ire1alphafe/femice) exhibit a reduced expression of pIre1alpha(Fig. 1None). Similar data were obtained with quantitative PCR (qPCR) from arcuate punches (Fig. 1None). As expected,Pomc-cre::Ire1alphafe/femice displayed diminished mRNA forXbp1sas well as the putative target genes of Xbp1s (Erdj4andGalE) in the arcuate nucleus (forXbp1s:t(11)= 2.507,P less than 0.05; forErdj4:t(4)= 6.645,P less than 0.05; forGalE:t(4)= 3.891,P less than 0.05) (Fig. 1None). However, we failed to detect alterations of ER stress markers and putative downstream targets forXbp1soutside the arcuate nucleus between control andPomc-cre::Ire1alphafe/femice (Fig. 1None). These data support a Pomc-specific downregulation of Ire1alpha expression in mice selectively deficient for Ire1alpha inPomc-cre::Ire1alphafe/femice. Pomc-specific deficiency ofIre1alphain the arcuate nucleus. AandB: The phosphorylation level of Ire1 (Ser724) in Pomc neurons was measured by immunohistochemistry both in thePomc-cre::tdtomato andPomc-cre::Ire1alphafe/fe::tdtomato mice. Arrows indicate Pomc neurons expressing pIre1alpha. Scale bars, 50 mum. CandD: qPCR was performed onPomc-cre::Ire1alphafe/femice and their littermate controls to examine the relative expression ofIre1alpha,Xbp1s,Erdj4, andGalE. *P less than 0.05 compared with control (wild-type littermates). Fold change is relative to 18S mRNA. n= 4-8 per group. Error bars indicate SEM. On a chow diet,Pomc-cre::Ire1alphafe/femice displayed similar body weight to littermate controls (Fig. 2None). However when fed an HFD, malePomc-cre::Ire1alphafe/femice exhibit an age-dependent increased body weight compared with wild-type mice (Fig. 2None), which was reflected by increased fat mass (t(10)= 3.171,P less than 0.05) (Fig. 2None). Age- and weight-matchedPomc-cre::Ire1alphafe/female mice had increased caloric intake and were hypometabolic, as demonstrated by significantly increased food intake and decreased energy expenditure (Fig. 2None-None). Pomc-cre::Ire1alphafe/femice were also less sensitive to acute leptin-induced hypophagia when compared with littermate controls at 1 h after refeeding (Fig. 2None). Body weight and metabolic assessment of male wild-type andPomc-cre::Ire1alphafe/femice. Body weight curve of malePomc-cre::Ire1alphafe/femice on a chow diet (A) or an HFD (B) (*P less than 0.05). C: Body fat composition of male mice on an HFD at 52 weeks (*P less than 0.05). D-J: MalePomc-cre::Ire1alphafe/femice were placed on an HFD at 8 weeks of age. Mice displayed decreased VO2(D), decreased VCO2(E), increased respiratory exchange ratio (RER) (F), decreased heat production (G), and increased food intake (FI) both in day/night cycles (H) and over 24 h (I), with no change in ambulatory activity (J). Error bars indicate SEM. Mice used inD-Jwere age-matched male littermates (8-12 weeks of age) and had comparable body weight and lean mass. ForD-J,n= 12-14 per group; *P less than 0.05. K: Leptin-induced hypophagia was observed at 1 h after refeeding in control mice. Pomc-cre::Ire1alphafe/femice failed to demonstrate hypophagia in response to pharmacological administration of oral (o) or intraperitoneal (IP) leptin (open squares) at 1 h after refeeding. IP, intraperitoneal. n= 9 per group; *P less than 0.05. Several studies have suggested that melanocortin neurons regulate intrascapular BAT (iBAT), which is a key component of adaptive thermogenesis (17,24,25). Components of adaptive "nonshivering" thermogenesis include coordinated neuroendocrine responses to the energy demands of an HFD as well as cold exposure. Even though chow-fedPomc-cre::Ire1alphafe/femice failed to exhibit alterations in body weight, we found that transcripts associated with heat production were reduced in BAT fromPomc-cre::Ire1alphafe/femice (Fig. 3None). Similar to previous reports, control mice fed an HFD displayed increased markers of heat production in BAT (Fig. 3None). However, this was not the case in BAT fromPomc-cre::Ire1alphafe/felittermates (Fig. 3None). Moreover, analyses of BAT histology after 12-24 h at 6 degrees C demonstrated impaired thermogenic responses inPomc-cre::Ire1alphafe/femice (Fig. 3None). In addition, iWAT in cold-exposedPomc-cre::Ire1alphafe/femice failed to show evidence of "browning" based on histology (Fig. 3None) or protein expression (Fig. 3None). Together, these data suggest thatIre1alphainPomcneurons is essential for adaptive thermogenesis including recruitment of BAT and browning of iWAT. Deletion ofIre1alphainPomcneurons impairs BAT function and cold tolerance. A:Pomc-cre::Ire1alphafe/femice and wild-type littermates were fed a chow diet or an HFD. qPCR was performed to examine the relative expression ofPpargc1alpha,Prdm16,UCP1,Cidea,Dio2, andElovl6, which are genes associated with heat production in BAT. For comparisons between wild type (WT) mice on a chow diet andPomc-cre::Ire1alphafe/femice on a chow diet (forPpargc1alpha:t(11)= 2.698,P less than 0.05; forPrdm16:t(11)= 0.9525,P greater than 0.05; forUCP1:t(11)= 2.227,P less than 0.05; forCidea:t(11)= 2.411,P less than 0.05; forDio2:t(11)= 2.663,P less than 0.05; forElovl6:t(11)= 2.924,P less than 0.05). For comparisons between WT mice on an HFD andPomc-cre::Ire1alphafe/femice on an HFD (forPpargc1alpha:t(15)= 2.264,P less than 0.05; forPrdm16:t(15)= 2.306,P less than 0.05; forUCP1:t(15)= 2.543,P less than 0.05; forCidea:t(15)= 2.179,P less than 0.05; forDio2:t(15)= 2.715,P less than 0.05; forElovl6:t(15)= 1.717,P greater than 0.05). For comparisons between WT mice on a chow diet and WT mice on an HFD (forPpargc1alpha:t(10)= 1.188,P greater than 0.05; forPrdm16:t(10)= 2.661,P less than 0.05; forUCP1:t(10)= 2.162,P less than 0.05; forCidea:t(10)= 2.912,P less than 0.05; forDio2:t(10)= 5.090,P less than 0.05; forElovl6:t(10)= 2.825,P less than 0.05). For comparisons betweenPomc-cre::Ire1alphafe/femice on a chow diet andPomc-cre::Ire1alphafe/femice on an HFD (forPpargc1alpha:t(12)= 1.146,P greater than 0.05; forPrdm16:t(12)= 1.555,P greater than 0.05; forUCP1:t(12)= 1.762,P greater than 0.05; forCidea:t(12)= 0.4648,P greater than 0.05; forDio2:t(12)= 0.8777,P less than 0.05; forElovl6:t(12)= 0.6873,P greater than 0.05). B: Representative images of adipose histology demonstrating increased lipid droplets in BAT and decreased multilocular cells in iWAT from mice deficient forIre1alphainPomcneurons (chow diet). C: Blots represent changes in iWAT UCP1 protein levels in response to cold exposure (chow diet). *P less than 0.05. Along with the systemic effects on whole-body energy expenditure and body weight, deficiency ofIre1alphainPomcneurons also leads to alterations in glucose metabolism. In particular,Pomc-cre::Ire1alphafe/femice showed impaired glucose tolerance independent of diet when compared with littermate controls (P less than 0.05) (Fig. 4NoneandNone). Pomc-cre::Ire1alphafe/femice were also insulin intolerant (P less than 0.05) (Fig. 4NoneandNone). Although serum insulin was only modestly increased, GSIS was increased 30 min after a glucose load (t(20)= 2.244,P less than 0.05) (Supplementary Fig. 1). Impaired glucoregulation in mice deficient forIre1alphainPomcneurons. Plots for glucose tolerance tests, insulin tolerance tests, and PTTs (area under the curve inset) respectively fromPomc-cre::Ire1alphafe/femice and wild-type littermates on a chow diet (A-C) or an HFD (D-F). G: Livers were collected fromPomc-cre::Ire1alphafe/femice and wild-type littermates on a chow diet. qPCR was performed to examine the relative expression ofFoxo1,Hnf4alpha,Pcx,G6pc, andPepck, which are genes associated with glucose production in the liver. *P less than 0.05. Mammals maintain euglycemia within a very tight range, largely dependent upon glucose production and/or secretion from the liver. The livers of chow-fedPomc-cre::Ire1alphafe/femice displayed elevated gluconeogenic markers (forFoxo1:t(6)= 2.883,P less than 0.05; forHNF4alpha:t(6)= 5.562,P less than 0.05; forPcx:t(6)= 3.993,P less than 0.05; forG6pc:t(6)= 4.648,P less than 0.05; forPepck:t(6)= 3.160,P less than 0.05) (Fig. 4None). Moreover, when pyruvate was provided as a fuel source (PTT), chow-fedPomc-cre::Ire1alphafe/femice displayed increased serum glucose levels (Fig. 4NoneandNone), supportive of increased glucose production capacity within the liver. We next performed hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps to assess whether insulin sensitivity was altered in chow-fedPomc-cre::Ire1alphafe/femice versus wild-type littermates of similar body weight (Fig. 5None). Plasma insulin was elevated similarly in both groups (Fig. 5None) and blood glucose was clamped at target levels (?150 mg/dL) (Fig. 5None) using an exogenous glucose infusion rate (GIR) (Fig. 5None). The required GIR during the steady-state period (t= 80-120 min) was lower inPomc-cre::Ire1alphafe/femice, indicating impaired insulin sensitivity (Fig. 5None). This was due to impaired insulin-mediated suppression of endogenous glucose appearance (endoRa) (Fig. 5None). There were no significant differences in insulin-stimulated glucose disappearance (Rd) (Fig. 5None). Together these data suggest that Pomc neurons selectively deficient forIre1alphaare linked to impaired insulin sensitivity, which may contribute to hyperglycemia. Impaired insulin sensitivity in 5 h-fasted mice lackingIre1alphain Pomc neurons. Body weight (A), basal and clamp plasma insulin (B), and blood glucose (C) during a 120-min hyperinsulinemic (2.5 mU/kg/min)-euglycemic (150 mg/dL) clamp in chronically catheterized, conscious, unrestrained mice (n= 8-10/group). D: Exogenous GIR needed to clamp blood glucose. EandF: Basal and clamp endogenous rates of glucose appearance (endoRa) and disappearance (Rd) determined using a constant infusion of [3,4-13C2]glucose to determine plasma M+2 glucose enrichment measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Blood samples were taken from the cut tail, and glucose was measured using a commercial glucometer. *P less than 0.05 and error bars indicate SEM. Upregulation of theIre1alpha-Xbp1spathway inPomcneurons mimics a postprandial state and improves metabolism via aPtp1b/Socs3-dependent mechanism (17). Oppositely, the current study suggests that loss of this pathway impairs energy balance and glucose metabolism. However, whether an inverse ER stress-dependent mechanism is also present remains unclear. Deficiency ofIre1alphainPomcneurons inducedBip,Ptp1b, andSocs3mRNA within the arcuate nucleus (forBip:t(13)= 2.241,P less than 0.05; forPtp1b:t(13)= 1.924,P greater than 0.05; forSocs3:t(13)= 2.375,P less than 0.05) (Fig. 6), supporting the hypothesis thatPomc-cre::Ire1alphafe/femice display increased basal ER stress. Regulation ofBip,Ptp1b, andSocs3in the arcuate nucleus and the remaining hypothalamus. qPCR was performed on mice chronically fed an HFD to examine the relative expression ofBip,Ptp1b,and Socs3. *P less than 0.05 compared with control (wild-type littermates). Fold change is relative to 18S mRNA. n =4-8 per group. Error bars indicate SEM. We previously demonstrated that chemical activation of ER stress (6 h) in the arcuate nucleus results in acute leptin and insulin resistance of arcuatePomcneurons (17). We hypothesized that the amplified basal ER stress present in the arcuate nucleus ofPomc-cre::Ire1alphafe/femice may result in an increased susceptibility to ER stress-induced leptin and insulin resistance. Whole-cell recordings were performed on acute hypothalamic slices containingPomc-hrGFP neurons within the arcuate nucleus (17,26,27). Similar to previous results (17), leptin depolarized while insulin hyperpolarized subsets ofPomcneurons within the arcuate nucleus (Fig. 7None-NoneandFig. 8None). Moreover,Pomcneurons fromPomc-cre::Ire1alphafe/femice demonstrated analogous acute cellular responses to leptin and insulin (Fig. 7NoneandFig. 8None). Pretreatment of arcuate slices with tunicamycin (30 umol/L, 1 h) from wild-typePomc-GFP mice failed to alter the acute leptin (t(13)= 0.6021,P greater than 0.05) (Fig. 7None) and insulin (t(14)= 1.369,P greater than 0.05) (Fig. 8None) induced changes in membrane potential. Importantly, pretreatment of arcuate slices with tunicamycin (30 umol/L, 1 h) fromPomc-cre::Ire1alphafe/femice was sufficient to abrogate the ability of leptin (t(14)= 5.708,P less than 0.05) (Fig. 7None) or insulin (t(14)= 5.677,P less than 0.05) (Fig. 8None) to alter the membrane potential of arcuatePomcneurons. Pretreatment of tunicamycin alone failed to alter the resting membrane potential and excitability ofPomcneurons (Supplementary Table 1). These data support thatPomcneurons deficient forIre1alphaare predisposed to the desensitizing effects of ER stress on acute leptin and insulin signaling. Pretreatment with tunicamycin (Tm) abrogated the leptin-induced activation ofPomcneurons deficient forIre1alpha. Brightfield (BF) illumination (A) of a Pomc-hrGFP neuron from a GFP-labeled mouse.

Dashed line indicates the resting membrane potential. Leptin-induced change in membrane potential from control and Tm-treated groups are shown in panel 3. ****P less than 0.001. Deletion ofIre1alphafromPomcneurons accelerated the acute insulin resistance inPomcneurons.

Dashed line indicates the resting membrane potential. Histogram shows the insulin-induced change in membrane potential from control and Tm-incubated groups (3). B: Representative traces illustrate an insulin-induced hyperpolarization ofPomcneurons fromPomc-cre::Ire1alpha::tdtomato mice (1) and that Tm pretreatment (2) blocks the insulin-induced hyperpolarization ofPomcneurons from the same mouse. Insulin-induced changes in membrane potential from control and Tm-pretreatment groups are shown in panel 3. ****P less than 0.001. Although the requirement ofIre1alphain specific organs and tissues remains incompletely understood, it is of particular interest that deficiency ofIre1alphainPomcneurons has effects on body weight and glucose homeostasis. In particular, we demonstrate that selective deficiency ofIre1alphainPomcneurons (Pomc-cre::Ire1alphafe/femice) increased sensitivity to diet-induced obesity in mice. The increased body weight was dependent upon a hypometabolic phenotype (decreased energy expenditure and heat production) and increased food intake. Notably, these responses are phenotypic signatures of impaired leptin action withinPomcneurons (28-31). These data were supported by the reduced efficacy of leptin-induced hypophagia as well as the increased susceptibility of ER stress-induced acute leptin and insulin resistance in mice withPomc-specific deficiency ofIre1alpha. The hypometabolic phenotype was also accompanied by decreased markers for thermogenesis in BAT, which suggests thatIre1alphadeficiency inPomcneurons impairs compensatory thermogenesis in response to an HFD and may be a contributing factor in increased body weight. Similar toXbp1sactivity in the liver orPomcneurons (17,22), we also found that deficiency ofIre1alphainPomcneurons alone was sufficient to impair blood glucose and insulin levels (e.g., impaired glucose/insulin tolerance, increased gluconeogenic expression/PTT response, increased GSIS, and reduced hepatic insulin sensitivity) independent of changes in body weight. On a cellular level,Pomc-cre::Ire1alphafe/femice exhibited increased basal ER stress in the arcuate nucleus, contributing to an amplified sensitivity to ER stress-dependent leptin and insulin resistance. Together, these data support a model in which loss ofIre1alphainPomcneurons accelerates HFD-induced obesity while at the same time impairing glucose homeostasis. This study reinforces an important relationship betweenIre1alpha-Xbp1sandPtp1b/Socs3in the ER stress-induced acute leptin and insulin resistance of arcuatePomcneurons. In particular, bothSocs3andPtp1bare increased within the hypothalamus in a state of excess nutrition or obesity (32-36). Moreover, there is a fundamental role of ER stress in regulating leptin and insulin signaling in hypothalamicPomcneurons via aPtp1b/Socs3-dependent mechanism (17). In particular, transcripts of bothPtp1bandSocs3were also lowered in mice with constitutive activation ofXbp1sinPomcneurons (17). Pomcneurons selectively deficient for eitherPtp1borSocs3also demonstrated improved acute leptin and insulin signaling even in the presence of strong activators of ER stress (17). These data were supported in the current study by the inverse finding thatPomc-specific deficiency ofIre1alphastimulatesPtp1band Socs3 in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus. This also correlated with a decreased sensitivity to pharmacological leptin-induced hypophagia as well as at the cellular level an increased susceptibility to ER stress-dependent acute leptin and insulin resistance. These data support aPtp1b/Socs3-dependent, ER stress-induced acute leptin and insulin resistance in the absence ofIre1-Xbp1activation. Another salient finding is the suggestion that theIre1alpha-Xbp1spathway inPomcneurons is required and sufficient (17) for diet- and cold-induced thermogenesis in iBAT and "browning" of iWAT, respectively. This is topical given that activation of functional iBAT depots in adult humans (37-40) as well as induction of thermogenic programs in WAT (41,42) has recently emerged as a potential therapeutic approach in the treatment of obesity and diabetes (43). However, it is important to clarify that our data cannot firmly establish that defects in iBAT and/or ability to "brown" iWAT contribute to altered energy expenditure, body weight, and/or glycemia in mice. In fact, mice deficient forIre1alphainPomcneurons exhibited decreased thermogenic markers in BAT independent of changes in body weight on a chow diet. However, when exposed to an HFD, the defects in thermogenesis of BAT were greatly exaggerated. Moreover, transgenic overexpression of theIre1alpha-Xbp1spathway inPomcneurons increased thermogenesis of BAT and iWAT concomitant with a protection against diet-induced obesity independent of changes in food intake (17). Thus, although it is difficult to determine the independent contribution of energy intake versus energy expenditure resulting in weight gain, theIre1alpha-Xbp1spathway inPomcneurons consistently modifies thermogenic programs that may underlie deficits associated with obesity. The current study also highlights an important transient regulation of leptin and potentially insulin signaling within arcuatePomcneurons. In particular, leptin signaling withinPomcneurons is necessary and sufficient to regulate proper energy and glucose homeostasis (28,29). Although insulin signaling alone inPomcneurons minimally alters energy balance or glucose metabolism, loss of both leptin and insulin signaling results in larger glycemic dysregulation than loss of either receptor alone (44). Chemical activation of ER stress abrogates leptin and insulin signaling within the periphery as well as the CNS (includingPomcneurons) (17,21,45). Also, increased basal ER stress as occurs with loss ofIre1alphainPomcneurons accelerated leptin and insulin resistance. The acute gating of these signaling pathways (both leptin and insulin via a mechanism similar to a rheostat) may contribute to alterations in energy balance and systemic glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity. Importantly, bothIre1alphaandXbp1sare regulated depending on various metabolic states (17,22,46). Thus, this may highlight an important conserved mechanism that responds to fluctuating energy demands, independent of altered leptin and insulin levels. It is important to note that in addition to the role ofIre1alphain the regulation of Xbp1s activity,Ire1alphahas additional endonuclease and intrinsic kinase activity that ultimately facilitates recovery from ER stress (47-50). Although the current study supports a model demonstrating a requirement of theIre1alpha-Xbp1spathway in the protection from obesity and diabetes, we cannot exclude the possibility that additional activities ofIre1alpha(endonuclease or intrinsic kinase activity) may contribute to the metabolic phenotypes observed in the current study. Moreover, the age dependence of the body weight phenotype as well as the tunicamycin-dependent blunting of acute leptin and insulin signaling in arcuate Pomc neurons may suggest the requirement of a "trigger" in order to elicit changes in metabolism. Several triggers could be sufficient to drive these processes, including aging and HFD (both of which can precipitate hypothalamic ER stress). Overall, these findings extend the physiologically important role of ER stress and the UPR inPomcneurons to regulate sensitivity to humoral signals, ultimately contributing to diet-induced obesity and diabetes. Notably,Ptp1bandSocs3are reciprocally regulated in response to alteredIre1alpha-Xbp1ssignaling, providing a potential molecular link between ER stress and leptin/insulin resistance. Together, these data highlight multiple molecular targets that may contribute to obesity and diabetes.
