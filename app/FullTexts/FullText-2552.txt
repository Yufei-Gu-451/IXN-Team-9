Identification of novel factors that enhance beta-cell proliferation and mass regeneration in vivo while retaining optimal function would serve as an ideal strategy for remediation of all forms of diabetes. Adult beta-cell mass adapts to changing physiological demands, such as pregnancy and obesity (1). beta-Cell mass expansion and regeneration occur primarily by replication of existing beta-cells (2-4). The proportion of replicative beta-cells declines dramatically with age (1). This age-dependent decline in basal proliferation and reduced ability of beta-cells to re-enter the cell cycle limits the regenerative potential of adult beta-cells (2). Processes that mediate the age-dependent decrease in proliferative and regenerative capacity remain poorly understood (3-5). Factors involved in beta-cell replication in response to stimuli such as pregnancy, high-fat diet (HFD) feeding, and beta-cell destruction have been identified (6). Understanding the underlying mechanisms or signaling pathways would move us closer to in vivo beta-cell mass regeneration as a therapy. The beta-cell proliferative factor connective tissue growth factor (CTGF/CCN2) is a member of the CCN family of secreted extracellular matrix-associated proteins (7). TGF-beta and integrin signaling are enhanced by CTGF; CTGF antagonizes BMP and Wnt (8-11). Depending on the growth factor milieu in the microenvironment, CTGF can regulate several cellular processes including proliferation, adhesion, extracellular matrix remodeling, and angiogenesis (12). In the pancreas, CTGF is expressed in ductal epithelium, vascular endothelium, and embryonic insulin-producing cells; expression in beta-cells is silenced soon after birth (13). Our laboratory showed that CTGF is required for beta-cell proliferation during embryogenesis and that transgenic overexpression of CTGF in embryonic insulin-producing cells increases beta-cell proliferation and mass (14). In contrast, induction of CTGF in adult beta-cells, under normal conditions, does not increase beta-cell proliferation or mass (15). However, CTGF is re-expressed in adult beta-cells during pregnancy and in response to HFD feeding (13) (R.E. Mosser and M. Gannon, unpublished observations), suggesting that it plays a role in beta-cell compensation during known periods of beta-cell mass expansion. In this study, we examined the potential of CTGF to promote adult beta-cell mass proliferation in vivo after partial beta-cell destruction and ex vivo. We show that CTGF induction after 50% beta-cell destruction increases beta-cell proliferation, resulting in 50% beta-cell mass recovery. CTGF increases the number of immature beta-cells, promoting proliferation of both mature and immature beta-cells. In conjunction, CTGF shortens the beta-cell replicative refractory period, allowing single beta-cells to undergo multiple rounds of cell division. Gene expression analyses revealed that CTGF elicits its effects via upregulation of cell-cycle regulators, TGF-beta signaling components, and key growth factors known to enhance beta-cell replication. These studies have implications on how the islet microenvironment allows for beta-cell responsiveness to proproliferative factors. Generation of rat insulin promoter (RIP)-rtTA (16), TetO-CTGF (14), and RIP-diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) (17) transgenic mice were described previously. Primers are available upon request. The Vanderbilt University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved all mouse studies. Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests were performed as described (18). Pancreata were dissected, fixed, and processed as in Golson et al. (19). Insulin/5-chloro-2'-deoxyuridine (CldU)/5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine (IdU) was performed as in Teta et al. (20). SeeTable 1for immunolabeling details. Imaging was with a ScanScope FL scanner (Aperio Technologies, Inc.) and quantified using Metamorph 6.1 (Molecular Devices). Unless otherwise noted, five sections greater than 250 mum apart were selected and immunolabeled with greater than =4,000 cells per animal quantified. Antibody informationNa citrate, sodium citrate; ON, overnight; RT, room temperature; TEG, Tris-EGTA. Ten to 12 slides per animal (1 to 2% of entire pancreas) were immunolabeled for insulin, visualized via the DAB Peroxidase Substrate Kit (Vector Laboratories), and counterstained with eosin. Quantification of beta-cell mass was performed as in Golson et al. (21). Briefly, one pancreatic section per slide was scanned using a ScanScope CS slide scanner (Aperio Technologies, Inc.). Images from each experiment were processed identically with the ImageScope Software (Aperio Technologies, Inc.). beta-Cell mass was measured by obtaining the ratio of insulin-positive (ins+) area to total pancreas area of all scanned sections per animal and multiplied by the pancreatic wet weight. Five slides (at least 250 um apart) per animal were selected and immunolabeled for insulin and Ki67. A minimum of 4,000 cells were counted using Metamorph 6.1 software (Molecular Devices). The percentage of proliferating cells was determined by dividing the number of Ki67/insulin double-positive cells by the total number of ins+cells. Number of beta-cells in each islet was quantified. Five slides at least 250 um apart per animal were selected. Average beta-cell size was determined by dividing the area of each islet by beta-cell number. beta-Cells from greater than =125 islets per animal were assessed. Sections were imaged and analyzed for insulin. All ins+clusters were counted and binned by size ( less than 8 or greater than =8 cells, greater than =200 islets). Sections were immunolabeled for insulin and CD31. Platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM)-positive area of at least 100 islets was measured. Percentage of blood vessel area was determined by dividing total PECAM area by total ins+area. Sections were immunolabeled for insulin, E-cadherin, and Ki67. The number of Ki67/E-cadherin/insulin triple-positive cells and Ki67/insulin double-positive cells was quantified. A total of 50 ng cDNA was prepared from islet RNA using the SuperScript III First Stand Synthesis System according to the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Real-time reactions were with iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) (E-cadherin: forward, 5'-AGGCGGGAATCGTGGC-3' and reverse, 5'-AAGGATTCCGAGGATGGCA-3'; and p16: forward, 5'-CCGTCGTACCCCGATTCAG-3' and reverse, 5'-GCACCGTAGTTGAGCAGAAGAG-3'). Collagen staining and quantification was completed as described (15). beta-Cell apoptosis and necrosis was quantified via ApoAlert DNA fragmentation kits according to the manufacturer (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.). Slides were colabeled with insulin. Sections were immunolabeled for insulin, MafA, MafB, and Ki67. Percentage of mature and immature beta-cells was determined by dividing number of MafA/insulin double-positive cells or MafB/insulin double-positive cells by total number of ins+cells, respectively. To assess maturity of proliferating beta-cells, the number of triple-positive cells was divided by total number of MafA/insulin double-positive cells. The percentage of immature proliferating beta-cells was assessed by dividing the number of Ki67+/MafA-/ins+cells by total number of MafA-/ins+cells. Mice were treated with CldU for 2 days after diptheria toxin (DT), followed by a 1- or 3-week washout period, and then 5 days' IdU treatment. Doxycycline (Dox) was administered from the last DT injection until sacrifice. Sections were immunolabeled for insulin or MafA, with CldU and IdU, as in Teta et al. (20). Islets were isolated from 10-week-old female C57Bl/6J mice and cultured at 37 degrees C in RPMI containing 11 mmol/L glucose and 10% horse serum. Approximately 20 islet equivalents were cultured per well in a 96-well plate overnight. Islets were treated with vehicle or recombinant human CTGF (22). beta-Cell proliferation was assayed as in Mosser and Gannon (23), with a minimum of 2,500 cells quantified per animal. Islets were isolated from 10-week-old females and immediately prepared for RNA isolation by being placed in TRIzol reagent. RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini kits (Qiagen). A total of greater than 250 ng cDNA was prepared from islet RNA using the SuperScript III First Stand Synthesis System (Invitrogen). Primers are available on request. TaqMan low-density arrays were conducted on a 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR system. Data were analyzed with SDS RQ Study software (Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies). Islets were isolated from 8-week-old animals as described above. Following isolation, islets were immediately lysed in RIPA buffer, and protein content was quantified using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). A total of 3.5 mug of protein per sample was electrophoresed on 4-12% Bis-Tris gels under denaturing conditions and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using the NuPAGE Western blotting system (Invitrogen). Blots were blocked and probed with the following primary antibodies diluted in 5% nonfat milk in 1x Tris-buffered saline with Tween and incubated overnight at 4 degrees C: rabbit anti-phospho-Smad3 (1:1,000; Abcam), rabbit anti-Smad2/3 (1:500; Cell Signaling Technology), and rabbit anti-beta-tubulin (1:5,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit secondary antibody (1:5,000; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) was used for protein detection and facilitated by an ECL Prime detection system (Amersham) using Kodak X-Omat Blue film. Protein levels were quantified using ImageJ software. Results are expressed as mean +/- SEM. Statistical significance was calculated by Studentttest, one-way or two-way ANOVA, and Tukey post hoc analysis where applicable. Pvalues less than =0.05 were considered significant. We hypothesized that CTGF would promote beta-cell mass regeneration following beta-cell loss. To assess this, a DT-mediated model of beta-cell ablation was used (17). In this model, a transgene containing the RIP driving DTR expression was targeted to thehprtlocus on the X chromosome. We used the less severe model of 50% beta-cell ablation afforded by hemizygous RIP-DTR female mice (which express DTR in 50% of beta-cells on average due to random X-inactivation). beta-Cell mass was not affected in control animals (RIP-rtTA or TetO-CTGF) after DT administration, and alpha-cell mass was unaffected in all treatments (Supplementary Fig. 1None-None). No changes in blood glucose clearance were observed after 50% beta-cell ablation, as assessed by intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (Supplementary Fig. 1None). This was anticipated, as 50% beta-cell mass is sufficient to maintain glucose tolerance under normal conditions. To assess if CTGF promotes beta-cell mass regeneration, a beta-cell-specific Dox-inducible CTGF bitransgenic model was used (RIP-rtTA;TetO-CTGF). Specificity of CTGF induction has been previously confirmed (15). Homozygous RIP-DTR females were interbred with RIP-rtTA;TetO-CTGF males. Hemizygous RIP-DTR;RIP-rtTA;TetO-CTGF females and hemizygous RIP-DTR;RIP-rtTA female littermate controls were used. Since CTGF upregulation is sometimes associated with increased fibrosis (24), collagen deposition was quantified. No increase in peri-islet collagen was observed, even after 8 weeks of CTGF overexpression (Supplementary Fig. 2). This agrees with our previously published results (15) and demonstrates that islets can be exposed to continuous CTGF for several weeks with no deleterious effects on fibrosis. DT was administered at 8 weeks of age to RIP-DTR;RIP-rtTA controls (Ablation) and RIP-DTR;RIP-rtTA;TetO-CTGF experimental animals (Ablation+CTGF) and CTGF induced for 2 days, 2 weeks, or 4 weeks after DT injection. Non-DT-injected animals included controls (Control) and those in which CTGF was induced without ablation (CTGF) (Fig. 1None). Neither 50% beta-cell ablation nor CTGF induction alone had an effect on glucose homeostasis (Supplementary Fig. 3None-None). CTGF induction under normal conditions in adult islets elicited no increase in either beta-cell mass expansion or beta-cell proliferation (Fig. 1NoneandNone) in agreement with our previous observations (15). Likewise, 50% beta-cell ablation alone did not induce beta-cell regeneration or proliferation (Fig. 1NoneandNone). This finding was unsurprising, as these animals maintain euglycemia and thus have no physiological impetus to expand beta-cell mass. CTGF promotes beta-cell mass regeneration and proliferation. (A) Experimental outline. Mice were administered 2 mg/mL of Dox in 2% Splenda in drinking water. DT (126 ng; Sigma-Aldrich) was given intraperitoneally three times at 8 weeks of age. beta-Cell mass (B-B") and proliferation (C-C"). (D) Representative images of beta-cell mass at 4 weeks. (E) Representative images of beta-cell proliferation 2 days after ablation with or without CTGF. Nuclei were visualized with DAPI (Molecular Probes).

CTGF overexpression after ablation resulted in partial restoration of beta-cell mass at 2 weeks and reached 50% mass recovery at 4 weeks (Fig. 1NoneandNone). The alpha-cell/beta-cell ratio of the Ablation+CTGF cohort improved after both 2 and 4 weeks of CTGF induction, indicative of an increase in beta-cell number (Fig. 2). alpha-Cell mass was unaltered with any treatment, and 50% beta-cell ablation did not stimulate alpha-cell transdifferentiation to a beta-cell fate (F. Thorel and P.L. Hererra, unpublished observations). beta-Cell proliferation was enhanced after only 2 days of CTGF treatment and maintained at all time points, although the degree of enhanced beta-cell proliferation declines at 4 weeks of CTGF overexpression (Fig. 1NoneandNone). Thus, the increase in beta-cell proliferation precedes beta-cell mass recovery (Fig. 1None). Eight weeks of continuous CTGF treatment after 50% beta-cell ablation elicited no further improvement in beta-cell mass recovery, suggesting a limit of restoration had been reached (data not shown). Thus, although adult beta-cells are unresponsive to CTGF under nonstimulatory conditions, CTGF can induce replication and beta-cell mass expansion in the unique microenvironment of beta-cell destruction. CTGF treatment after 50% beta-cell destruction elicits improved alpha-/beta-cell ratios. AandB: Example of actual raw data obtained: the numbers of ins+(green) and glucagon+(red) cells were quantified. Under normal conditions, beta-cells constitute ?75% of the total number of counted cells (Control). After DT injection, 50% of beta-cells are ablated, while alpha-cells remained unchanged (Ablation). This results in beta-cells accounting for ?60% of counted cells. In Ablation+CTGF animals, beta-cells account for ?70% of counted cells. C: Quantification of alpha-/beta-cell ratios after 2 (left) and 4 (right) weeks of Dox administration. n= 8. **P less than 0.01, ***P less than 0.001, ****P less than 0.0001. We examined whether other compensatory mechanisms also contributed to regeneration. Individual beta-cell size remained constant regardless of treatment (Fig. 3None), indicating that beta-cell mass expansion was not due to beta-cell hypertrophy. As surrogates for islet neogenesis, we evaluated total islet number and percentage of small ins+clusters. No change in either parameter was observed (Fig. 3NoneandNone). Overall, CTGF does not appear to promote beta-cell neogenesis in this model of beta-cell regeneration, although in the absence of a specific marker for neogenesis, we cannot conclusively rule this out. This was not surprising as neogenesis has been primarily described in more severe models of massive combined acinar and islet cell ablation (25). CTGF does not mediate beta-cell regeneration via hypertrophy, neogenesis, increased vascularization, or E-cadherin. 1. Control; 2. CTGF; 3. Ablation; and 4.

For proliferation analysis,n= 4. *P less than 0.05, **P less than 0.01, ***P less than 0.001. Pancreatic islets are highly vascularized, and their endothelium produces factors such as hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), which induce beta-cell mass expansion (26,27). As CTGF is an angiogenic factor (28), it could promote beta-cell regeneration indirectly via enhanced vascularization. CTGF did not elicit an increase in islet vascular density, as assessed by PECAM+area (Fig. 3NoneandNone), in agreement with our previously published results (15), although it remains possible that CTGF induces production of endothelial-derived beta-cell growth factors. Based on a recent study showing thatE-cadherinknockdown enhances beta-cell proliferation (29), we hypothesized that 50% beta-cell ablation might result in decreased cell-cell contacts and decreased E-cadherin expression, contributing to increased beta-cell proliferation. We assessedE-cadherinexpression via quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) after 2 days of CTGF induction (the peak of beta-cell proliferation). E-cadherinlevels (Fig. 3None) and the percentage of proliferating beta-cells that were E-cadherin+or E-cadherin-was the same across all cohorts (Fig. 3None). beta-Cell replication did not correlate with decreased E-cadherin protein membrane localization (Fig. 3None). We next tested whether CTGF improves beta-cell mass regeneration by enhancing cell survival. CTGF expression was induced for 1 week prior to, during, and for 2 days following beta-cell destruction (Fig. 4None). No difference in beta-cell death (TUNEL) was observed between Ablation and Ablation+CTGF, indicating that CTGF cannot protect against beta-cell death in this particular model (Fig. 4NoneandNone), although this does not exclude the possibility that CTGF may have prophylactic affects in other models of beta-cell death. Additionally, no impairment to blood glucose homeostasis was observed (Supplementary Fig. 3None). "Primed" animals displayed no improvement in either beta-cell mass (Fig. 4None) or proliferation (Fig. 4None) compared with 2 days' CTGF treatment. Priming islets with CTGF does not improve beta-cell survival or enhance beta-cell proliferation and mass. A: Experimental outline.

Taken together, our findings suggest that adult beta-cell ablation results in an islet microenvironment that facilitates CTGF-induced beta-cell regeneration solely through increased replication of existing beta-cells. Thus, following ablation, changes intrinsic to beta-cells themselves or in the islet microenvironment allow for responsiveness to CTGF. beta-Cell intrinsic changes that we considered in this study include alterations in the maturation state, replication refractory period, and expression of genes involved in key signaling pathways. There is controversy about whether beta-Cell maturity is maintained during replication (30-32). The MafA transcription factor is associated with beta-cell maturity and optimal function (30,33,34). Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated that CTGF overexpression in embryonic beta-cells resulted in increased proliferation of MafA-/ins+cells; MafA+cells did proliferate, but their proliferation was unaltered with CTGF (14). CTGF may specifically enhance beta-cell proliferation in immature (MafA-) beta-cells following beta-cell ablation. Approximately 15-20% of adult beta-cells are normally MafA-(33) (Fig. 5None); this population of cells may be the most responsive to CTGF treatment. beta-Cell proliferation characteristics in response to ablation and CTGF.

Mice were administered 2 mg/mL of Dox in 2% Splenda in drinking water. DT (126 ng) was given intraperitoneally three times at 8 weeks of age. Uridine analogs (CldU or IdU; both from Sigma-Aldrich) were administered at 1 mg/mL in Dox-treated drinking water. beta-Cell replication during the first 2 days (red bars), last 5 days (green bars), and both labeling periods (yellow bars) at 2 (E) and 4 (F) weeks was determined. A minimum of 4,000 cells were counted. The percentage of beta-cells undergoing replication during both labeling periods was obtained by dividing the number of CldU/IdU/Insulin triple-positive cells by the total number of ins+cells. The percentage of dual-labeled beta-cells at 4 weeks was significantly higher than at 2 weeks (demarked by #). Ratios between subgroups (i.e., CldU+:IdU+, CldU:CldU+;IdU+, and IdU:CldU+; IdU+) were determined. (G-G") Representative images at 4 weeks.

N.S., not significant. To assess whether beta-cell immaturity or partial dedifferentiation is associated with enhanced permissiveness to CTGF, we examined MafA expression in ins+cells at 2 days (Fig. 5None). beta-Cell ablation alone resulted in a significantly higher percentage (?28%) of immature (MafA-) beta-cells compared with controls (?20%). CTGF treatment enhanced the increase in MafA-beta-cells after ablation (?35%), but had no effect on the number of MafA-/ins+cells under normal conditions. Additionally, MafB expression in ins+cells was assayed at 2 days. In mice, the MafB transcription factor is normally expressed in embryonic and early neonatal beta-cells and is indicative of an immature beta-cell (33). Correlating with the decrease in MafA+cells (Fig. 5None), a significant increase (?4%) in immature (MafB+) beta-cells was detected in Ablation alone or Ablation+CTGF cohorts as compared with controls (?1%) (Supplementary Fig. 4None). To determine whether CTGF specifically promotes replication of immature beta-cells in the setting of regeneration, mature (MafA+;Ki67+/MafA+;ins+) and immature (MafA-;Ki67+/MafA-;ins+) proliferating beta-cells were quantified (Fig. 5NoneandNone). The 50% beta-cell destruction alone did not provoke an increase in proliferation in immature beta-cells. However, CTGF expression after ablation yielded an increase in proliferation of both mature and immature beta-cells. While the increase in mature beta-cell proliferation was significant, the percentage of immature beta-cells proliferating was strikingly increased threefold as compared with all other cohorts. Overall, these data indicate that in the setting of beta-cell destruction, CTGF stimulates proliferation in both mature and immature beta-cells. The increase in immature beta-cells after beta-cell destruction is particularly exploited by CTGF as a mechanism for beta-cell regeneration. Between self-renewal cycles, beta-cells undergo an extensive refractory period and are unable to re-enter the cell cycle (4,20). This refractory period is labile, shortening in periods of increased demand, such as pregnancy and 50% partial pancreatectomy (20). To determine if 50% beta-cell ablation and/or CTGF treatment induces changes in the replicative refractory period, we used a dual labeling system involving two distinct uridine analogs (Fig. 5NoneandNone) (20). This process allows for labeling of newly synthesized DNA, marking actively proliferating beta-cells, at two distinct time points. beta-Cell nuclei incorporating both labels are indicative of two rounds of replication during the labeling period. We quantified the number of single-positive (CldU+or IdU+) and dual-positive (CldU+;IdU+) beta-cells after 2 or 4 weeks of CTGF treatment (Fig. 5NoneandNone). At both time points, islets from Ablation+CTGF animals displayed an increase in the percentage of single-labeled beta-cells. Additionally, in this cohort a greater number of beta-cells underwent replication in the first 2 days (CldU+) compared with the last 5 days of labeling (IdU+) (red vs. green bars). A prominent increase in the number of dual-labeled beta-cells was observed in the Ablation+CTGF cohort, indicative of a shortened beta-cell replicative refractory period. An increase in dual-labeled beta-cells was observed with 4 weeks of CTGF induction after beta-cell ablation as compared with the 2-week time point (Fig. 5NoneandNone;P= 0.0414). This increase is not surprising given the longer washout period. We calculated the ratio of single-labeled cells versus dual-labeled cells to ensure the increase in dual-labeled cells was not simply proportional to the overall increase in proliferation. In the Ablation+CTGF cohort, there was a statistically significant decrease in the average ratio of single-labeled beta-cells to dual-labeled beta-cells (4.2:1 for CldU and 2.9:1 for IdU) as compared with control animals (8.2:1 for CldU and 8.4:1 for IdU). As our previous studies indicated that immature beta-cells proliferate at higher percentages than mature beta-cells in our Ablation+CTGF cohort (Fig. 5None), we assessed whether immature beta-cells were more likely to be dual-labeled (and thus have undergone two cycles of replication). We quantified the number of mature (MafA+;CldU+;IdU+) and immature (MafA-;CldU+;IdU+) beta-cells at the 2-week time point (Supplementary Fig. 4None). In all cohorts, dual-labeled beta-cells were not specific to the immature (MafA-) phenotype, as both mature and immature beta-cells underwent multiple rounds of replication in the 2-week time course. Most (?60%) of the dual-labeled beta-cells in the Control, CTGF-treated, and Ablation cohorts were mature. However, in congruence with our findings inFig. 5None, the Ablation+CTGF cohort had an increase in the number of dual-labeled immature beta-cells (?60%) with a shortened refractory period. Therefore, in the setting of beta-cell destruction, CTGF elicits beta-cell mass regeneration both by increasing the number of proliferating beta-cells and by reducing the period of time before these cells can re-enter the cell cycle. To determine whether CTGF can induce adult beta-cell proliferation directly, in the absence of other pancreatic cell types or systemic factors, we treated wild-type islets ex vivo for 4 days with different concentrations of recombinant human CTGF (rhCTGF). An increase in beta-cell proliferation was observed with increasing doses of rhCTGF (Fig. 6None), with an approximate twofold increase in proliferation observed at 250 ng/mL rhCTGF compared with vehicle control. These results indicate that the mitogenic effects of CTGF on adult beta-cells are not unique to our ablation model. CTGF induces beta-cell proliferation ex vivo and expression of genes involved in key signaling pathways and cell-cycle regulators.

To gain insight into signaling pathways altered by CTGF with or without beta-cell ablation, gene expression analysis was conducted on islets isolated from animals following 2 days of CTGF induction in vivo. We specifically probed changes in genes associated with beta-cell functional maturity, proliferation, and growth factor signaling pathways (Fig. 6None). Gene expression alterations specific to CTGF treatment, beta-cell ablation, and CTGF treatment after beta-cell ablation were determined and compared with changes in islets treated ex vivo with rhCTGF for 4 days. There were several changes in key cell-cycle regulators in response to ablation and/or CTGF treatment (Fig. 6NoneandNone'). CTGF induction under normal conditions elicited an increase incyclinD3expression, while ablation alone induced an increase incyclinB1,cyclinD1,cyclinD2, andKi67. beta-Cell ablation also upregulatedFoxm1, a key transcriptional regulator of beta-cell proliferation (35-38). These results are intriguing as no increase in beta-cell proliferation is detected in the Ablation cohort (Fig. 1None). CyclinD3,Ki67, andPCNAmRNAs were strikingly upregulated in the Ablation+CTGF cohort, in agreement with the highly significant increase in beta-cell proliferation. Upregulation of the cell-cycle inhibitorCdkn1a(p21) was also observed only in the Ablation+CTGF cohort, suggesting the increased beta-cell proliferation triggers an inhibitory feedback loop. However, other cell-cycle inhibitors,Cdkn1b(p27) andCdkn2a(p16), displayed no alteration in gene transcription (Fig. 6None, data not shown). Wild-type islets treated with rhCTGF ex vivo showed significant upregulation ofcyclinD1andcdk2and a trend toward an increase inCdkn1a(p21) andFoxm1. With regard to growth factor signaling pathways, CTGF treatment after 50% ablation resulted in an increase in TGF-beta (TGF-beta2, TGF-beta3, andTGF-betaR2), BMP (BMP2,BMP4, andBMP7), and Wnt-associated (beta-cateninandLrp5) genes (Fig. 6NoneandNone'). CTGF promotes, and is promoted by, TGF-beta signaling in other tissues, yet no significant changes in phospho-SMAD3 protein levels were detected in any experimental cohort (Supplementary Fig. 5) (8,39). However, in other tissues, CTGF expression is promoted by SMAD-independent TGF-beta signaling via extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) (40-42). Thus, in this model of beta-cell regeneration, CTGF may be promoted by TGF-beta signaling in an ERK-dependent manner. Additionally, BMP is a known inhibitor of CTGF (43), indicating CTGF expression regulatory networks are activated in response to CTGF upregulation. An increase in expression of tryptophan hydroxylase (Tph1), the serotonin (5-HT) synthesizing enzyme, was observed specifically in islets of the Ablation+CTGF cohort as compared with all other cohorts (Fig. 7None). Several additional genes were upregulated only in the presence of both 50% beta-cell ablation and CTGF treatment, includingHGF, its receptorc-Met, and integrins alpha5 (Itgalpha5) and beta1 (Itgbeta1). Immunohistochemistry revealed an increase in phosphorylated ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2), a known downstream mediator of activated integrin beta1 (44,45), in islets of the Ablation+CTGF cohort as compared with all other cohorts (Fig. 7None). In addition, this strengthens the hypothesis that CTGF may be activating TGF-beta signaling in an ERK-dependent fashion. As 5-HT, integrin beta1, and HGF each promote beta-cell proliferation (27,45), these findings indicate that CTGF-mediated beta-cell regeneration involves recruitment of other proproliferative factors. Ex vivo incubation with rhCTGF upregulated endogenousCTGFexpression and other genes involved in TGF-beta signaling;Itgalpha5andMmp2showed a trend in increased expression. No change in BMP-associated gene expression was observed in wild-type mouse islets treated with rhCTGF ex vivo (data not shown).

Gene expression analysis revealed no significant alteration to several key beta-cell functional identity genes (Fig. 6None). This was unsurprising as all cohorts remain euglycemic at all time points and suggests that the surviving 50% of beta-cells in the ablation cohorts upregulate expression of these genes to wild-type levels. Intriguingly, upon 50% beta-cell ablation, an increase inglucokinase, involved in both beta-cell proliferation and function (46), is observed. Ngn3expression increased with CTGF treatment, and/or ablation, supporting the concept that these treatments promote a less differentiated state. Finally, upregulation ofMafB, a gene expressed in alpha-cells and immature beta-cells, is observed only in the Ablation+CTGF cohort. This correlates with the observed increase in the percentage of MafB+/ins+cells in the Ablation+CTGF cohort (Supplementary Fig. 4). No alteration inMafAexpression was observed in any cohort. This is not unexpected as only an 8 or 15% decrease in MafA+cells was observed in our Ablation or Ablation+CTGF cohorts, respectively (Fig. 5), and changes in MafA protein may be disconnected from changes inMafAgene expression (30). There were no significant changes in beta-cell function genes in response to exogenous CTGF in culture (data not shown). In this study, we investigated the potential of CTGF to promote adult beta-cell proliferation and mass expansion in the face of reduced functional beta-cell mass. Since diabetes results from insufficient beta-cell mass, identification of signaling pathways promoting adult beta-cell mass expansion could translate into therapies for endogenous beta-cell mass regeneration. In this study, we show that CTGF, a critical regulator of embryonic beta-cell proliferation, induces adult beta-cell mass proliferation and regeneration, and this is accompanied by increased expression of cell-cycle regulators, TGF-beta signaling components, and other known beta-cell proliferative stimuli (e.g., HGF and serotonin synthesis). Responsiveness to CTGF in vivo seems to be restricted to periods of increased functional demand: late embryogenesis, pregnancy, HFD, and reduced beta-cell mass, in which the strain on individual beta-cells has increased. The effects of CTGF on beta-cell mass recovery do not appear to be due to factors other than increased beta-cell proliferation. Importantly, CTGF treatment of adult beta-cells does not result in uncontrolled growth or hypoglycemia. Ex vivo, CTGF treatment activates genes involved in cell-cycle progression and induces adult beta-cell replication in the absence of systemic factors. During embryonic development, both MafA-/ins+and MafA+/ins+cells proliferate; however, CTGF enhances proliferation of only MafA-beta-cells (14). The lack of responsiveness of MafA+/ins+cells to CTGF under normal conditions might explain the inability of CTGF to induce replication in adult beta-cells in vivo under conditions of normal beta-cell mass. In the setting of beta-cell ablation, we find that CTGF induction enhanced proliferation of both mature and immature beta-cells. However, CTGF consistently elicits a greater increase in proliferation of immature beta-cells. Ablation alone also significantly increased the number of MafA-beta-cells, although these show no increase in proliferation. beta-Cells normally have a refractory period on the order of months but this period is labile and was shortened specifically with beta-cell ablation plus CTGF. Thus, CTGF appears to mediate beta-cell regeneration via enhanced beta-cell proliferation, particularly of immature beta-cells, and by shortening the beta-cell replicative refractory period. It may be that cells that are slightly less mature are more responsive to proliferative stimuli, such as CTGF. Whether these effects are unique to CTGF or are a property of other beta-cell proliferative factors remains to be tested. We have begun to dissect the pathways through which CTGF elicits beta-cell proliferation and regeneration. Increased expression of TGF-beta, BMP, and Wnt genes was observed only upon induction of CTGF after beta-cell ablation, while rhCTGF specifically induced genes involved in TGF-beta signaling. CTGF and TGF-beta are in a positive-feedback loop (39). Increases in BMP and Wnt components point toward an attempt to negatively regulate the effects of CTGF induction (47). The roles these signaling pathways play in beta-cell proliferation are unclear, although TGF-beta signaling may be required for beta-cell regeneration (48), and Wnt signaling is involved downstream of GLP-1-mediated beta-cell proliferation (49). A specific receptor for CTGF has not been identified-rather, CTGF interacts with integrins (11). Increased expression of integrins alpha5 and beta1 was observed in Ablation+CTGF animals. It was recently shown that integrin beta1 is absolutely critical for beta-cell proliferation and mass expansion at all ages (45). Additionally, an increase in phosphorylated ERK1/2, a known downstream effector of integrin beta1-mediated beta-cell proliferation (44,45), was observed solely in islets from the Ablation+CTGF cohort. Thus, it is highly likely that CTGF promotes beta-cell proliferation through integrin signaling. Additionally, CTGF induction after beta-cell ablation increases expression ofHgfand the serotonin synthesizing enzymeTph1, indicating that CTGF-mediated beta-cell regeneration involves the recruitment of other proproliferative factors (27,50,51). beta-Cell ablation and CTGF induction are each necessary, but not sufficient, to induce in vivo beta-cell proliferation in this model. However, rhCTGF can induce adult beta-cell proliferation in islets removed from their endogenous environment. Adult beta-cell cell-cycle re-entry may therefore require combinatorial stimuli to successfully initiate. All forms of diabetes are characterized by insufficient functional beta-cell mass. Thus, strategies to promote the replication, and subsequent mass regeneration, of pre-existing beta-cells are critical. The ability to elicit beta-cell mass regeneration is a novel role for CTGF and suggests that manipulation of CTGF signaling may serve as a therapeutic for diabetes. Additionally, our studies highlight the vital role the islet microenvironment plays in beta-cell responsiveness to proliferative stimuli.
