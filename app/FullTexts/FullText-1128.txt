Plant cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS), a maternally inherited trait that prevents plants from producing functional pollen, has been identified in many higher plants, including rice, cotton, maize, and sorghum (LiuNone., 2001;BentolilaNone., 2002;KleinNone., 2005;YinNone., 2006;FujiiNone., 2011). CMS restorer systems have been widely exploited to produce hybrids that outperform their inbred parents in yield, biomass, or other traits. CMS is usually attributed to an unusual chimeric gene in the mitochondrial genome (Schnable and Wise, 1998;Ivanov and Dymshits, 2007). In many cases, a nuclear-encoded fertility restorer gene (Rf) can restore fertility of the cytoplasmic male-sterile plants (Hanson and Bentolila, 2004). Therefore, the CMS/Rfsystem is an ideal model for dissecting the interaction between mitochondrial and nuclear genomes. A variety of mechanisms of fertility restoration by theRfgenes have been reported for different CMS systems. T-urf13, a mitochondrial gene encoding a 13kDa protein, has been detected only in maize carrying T male-sterile cytoplasm (DeweyNone., 1987;Fujii and Toriyama, 2008). The first restorer allele cloned, the maizeRf2gene, does not affect the expression ofurf13and encodes aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), which is located in the mitochondrial matrix in a homotetrameric form (CuiNone., 1996;LiuNone., 2001;Liu and Schnable, 2002). The cloned petuniaRf-PPR592gene is the first single dominantRfgene encoding a pentatricopeptide repeat-containing (PPR) protein that can eliminate the CMS-associated protein PCF (BentolilaNone., 2002). The Rf-PPR592 protein contains 11 continuous PPR motifs and is a part of the mitochondrial inner membrane-associated, RNase-sensitive large soluble high molecular weight complex that interacts withpcfmRNA (GillmanNone., 2007). The radishRfo/Rfk1gene for Ogura/Kosena CMS also encodes a mitochondrially targeted PPR protein of 687 amino acids comprising 16 repeats of the 35 amino acid PPR motif (BrownNone., 2003;DesloireNone., 2003;ImaiNone., 2003;KoizukaNone., 2003) that reduces the protein level of ORF138 without changing the level of mRNA (BellaouiNone., 1999;UyttewaalNone., 2008). Molecular components responsible for fertility restoration processes were deduced from various types of CMS/Rfsystems in rice. Either of two tightly linked genes,Rf1aandRf1b, can independently restore fertility to Boro II rice and have been identified as encoding PPR proteins, containing contiguous arrays of 18 and 11 PPR repeats, respectively (KomoriNone., 2004;WangNone., 2006). Rf1a blocks cytotoxic peptide ORF79 through endonucleolytic cleavage of the dicistronicB-atp6/orf79mRNA, whereas Rf1b degradesB-atp6/orf79mRNA (WangNone., 2006;KazamaNone., 2008). Rf17andRf2have been isolated as theRfgenes for CW-type and Lead Rice-type CMS, and have been shown to encode mitochondrial proteins, acyl-carrier protein synthase-like protein, and glycine-rich protein (GRP) that are not PPR proteins (Fujii and Toriyama, 2009;ItabashiNone., 2011). Interestingly, a recent work demonstrates that RF5, a PPR protein, physically interacts with GRP162, a GRP encoding 162 amino acids that was identified to bind toatp6-orfH79(HuNone., 2012). Here the map-based cloning of heterozygous alleles controlling male fertility of CMS in radish is reported. 9802A1 is a male-sterile strain. 9802B1 is a radish cultivar used as a maintainer of 9802A1. 9802A1 contains the same nuclear genome as 9802B1. 9606H is a Chinese radish cultivar. 0107H is a male-fertile strain carryingRfob(EU163282). The cross between 9802A1 and 9606H yielded male-fertile F1plants. Self-pollination of F1plants yielded an F2segregating population. The BC1F1 population was produced from the backcross between 9802A1 (the acceptor parent) and 9606H (the donor parent) (Supplementary Fig. S1available atJXBonline). Among the progeny involved in this work, two phenotypic classes were distinguished: male-fertile plants with full and dehiscent anthers and male-sterile plants with empty yellow anthers. To ensure the accuracy of the genetic position, the phenotypes of male-fertile recombinant F2plants were confirmed by phenotyping the F3progeny in a glasshouse. Floral buds at different developmental stages were fixed overnight in FAA [ethanol 50% (v/v), acetic acid 5.0% (v/v), and formaldehyde 3.7% (v/v)]. Fixed floral buds were dehydrated with a 50-100% ethanol series and embedded in Technovit 7100 (Heraeus Kulzer, Wehrheim/Ts., Germany) according to the manufacturer's manual. Transverse sections (1.5 mum thickness) were cut from the polymerized blocks on an ultramicrotome (Leica Ultracut R; Leica Microsystems) using glass knives, heat fixed to glass slides, and stained with 2% toluidine blue. Semi-thin sections were stained with 0.05% analine blue to detect callose. Slides were inspected and photographed using an Olympus BX61 microscope equipped with a colour CCD camera. The radish bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library consists of 120 000 clones and represents the haploid radish genome at least 23 times over (DesloireNone., 2003). The macroarrays are produced by spotting thousands of bacterial clones on the nylon membrane with a high-throughput machine (Q-Bot). The macroarray in pre-hybridization buffer (6* SSC, 5*Denhardt's, 100mg ml-1salmon sperm DNA) was pre-hybridized for at least 2h at 68 oC in a hybridization oven. The probe was denatured for 10min at 100 oC and immediately placed on ice. The pre-hybridization buffer was removed from the macroarrays. Then, the probe was added to hybridization buffer and hybridized overnight at 68 degrees C. Hybridized macroarrays were washed twice for 30min in wash buffer (2* SSC, 0.1% SDS) at 50 oC. After drying, macroarrays were wrapped in cling film, avoiding air bubbles. The level of radioactivity from a macroarray was checked, followed by fixation in a cassette. After scanning the macroarray with PhosphorImager, the analysis of the macroarray was carried out using high density filter reader (HDFR) software. About 5 mm*5mm from young seedlings was harvested into 96-well PCR plates with 50 mul of NaOH solution (0.25M) in each well, and plates were sealed. Plates were incubated at 96 degrees C for 10min in the PCR block, cooled on a bench, and spun down. A 50 mul aliquot of 0.25M HCl and 25 mul of buffer (0.5M TRIS-HCl, pH 8.0; 0.25% NP-40) were added. After mixing by inverting and spinning down, plates were incubated at 96 degrees C for 1min in a PCR block. A 0.6 mul aliquot of DNA was used for each 12.5 mul PCR. Total RNA was isolated from floral buds using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen Life Technologies) and first-strand cDNA was synthesized using a SMARTTM RACE cDNA amplification kit (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After reverse transcription, the products were diluted 10-fold with distilled water. The PCR mixture and conditions as described above were followed. The primers used for 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and 3'-RACE are listed inSupplementary Table 1atJXBonline. The expression patterns of the PPR transcripts were examined through strand-specific RT-PCR, in which 1.5 mug of total RNA was used for the first-strand cDNA synthesis with the SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) using the mixture of gene-specific primers. The cDNA reaction mixture was then diluted 10 times and 4 mul was used as a template in a 10 mul PCR with SYBR Green Supermix. PCR included a pre-incubation at 95 oC for 5min followed by 45 cycles of denaturation at 95 oC for 15 s, annealing at 60 oC for 20 s, and extension at 72 oC for 30 s. The comparative threshold (Ct) cycle method was used for determination of relative transcript levels with Actin 2/7 as an internal control. ChIP was performed as described byWierzbickiNone. (2008)with minor modifications. A 2g aliquot of above-ground tissue of seedlings was cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde by vacuum infiltration at room temperature three times, 5min each time, followed by the addition of glycine to 125mM vacuum infiltrate for an additional 5min. Plants were rinsed with distilled water, frozen in liquid nitrogen, ground into powder, suspended in 35ml of Honda buffer [20mM HEPES, 0.44M sucrose, 1.25% ficoll, 2.5% dextran T40, 10mM MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, 5mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 1% plant protease inhibitors], filtered through two layers of Miracloth twice, and centrifuged at 3100gfor 20min. Nuclear pellets were resuspended in 1ml of Honda buffer, centrifuged at 3100gfor 10min at 4 degrees C, resuspended in Nuclei Lysis Buffer (50mM TRIS-HCl pH 8.0, 10mM EDTA, 1% SDS, 1% plant protease inhibitors), and sonicated three times, 5min each time (30 s on/off intervals) at the 'Middle' setting. After centrifugation at 16 000gfor 7.5min, the supernatant was diluted 11-fold with ChIP dilution buffer (1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2mM EDTA, 16.7mM TRIS-HCl pH 8.0, 167mM NaCl, protease inhibitor cocktail). Immunoprecipitation was performed using 20 mul of Dynabeads protein G (Invitrogen) and 5 mul of Pol II antibody (Abcam ab5408). After reversion of cross-linking, samples were incubated with 40 mug of proteinase K (Invitrogen) at 50 oC for 1h, followed by heat inactivation at 95 oC for 10min. The resulting DNA was subjected to quantitative PCR in triplicate. Sequence data from this article can be found in the EMBL/GenBank data libraries under accession numbers JX521806 (RsRf3-1gene) and JX521807 (RsRf3-2gene). No cytological differences were observed between the fertile line 9802B1 and the male-sterile line 9802A1 in the anther tissues until the last stages of the tetrad (data not shown). At the tetrad stage, individual tetrads were completely encased by a thick callose wall in 9802B1 and 9802A1 (Fig. 1A,B). After the tetrad stage, the microspores from male-fertile plants increased in size and the microspore exine was quite evident (Fig. 1C). In contrast, although microspore exines were found in the male-sterile plants, microspores were malformed. At the same time, the tapetal cells grew abnormally large (Fig. 1D). At anthesis, the tapetal cells degenerated completely in both male-fertile and male-sterile anthers (Fig. 1E,F). Many fully mature pollen were observed in the locules of male-fertile anthers. In contrast, many remnants of microspore exine were found in the locules of male-sterile anthers (Fig. 1F). Comparative study of anthers through different developmental stages in the male-fertile and male-sterile plants from 9802A1 and 9802B1. (A, C, E) Semi-thin sections from male-fertile anthers. (B, D, F) Semi-thin sections from male-sterile anthers. A-2 and B-2 were stained with aniline blue; the others were stained with toluidine blue. (This figure is available in colour atJXBonline.) An F2population was derived from a cross between 9802A1 and 9606H. In total, 600 plants were examined from the population, of which 296 male-fertile and 304 male-sterile plants were identified by investigation of male fertility. The segregation ratio of fertile to sterile plants in this F2population best fitted a 1:1 ratio (P greater than 0.05), but not a 3:1 ratio (P less than 0.05), indicating control by heterozygous alleles at a single locus (designated asRsRf3). In addition, the single locus control of male fertility was also strongly supported by a 1:1 BC1F1 ratio of male-fertile to male-sterile plants in the backcross population between 9802A1 (the acceptor parent) and 9606H (the donor parent) (Supplementary Fig. S1,Supplementary Table S2atJXBonline). The data also demonstrated that fertility of the cytoplasmic male-sterile plant was restored by heterozygous alleles in a sporophytic manner. MostRfgenes cloned to date have PPR motifs (BentolilaNone., 2002;BrownNone., 2003;DesloireNone., 2003;ImaiNone., 2003;KoizukaNone., 2003;KomoriNone., 2004;WangNone., 2006). RiceRfgenes,Rf1aandRf1b, share 70% identity between their protein sequences (WangNone., 2006). It is possible that some radishRfgenes are descendents of a progenitor restorerPPRgene (BrownNone., 2003), and that these multiple genes arose in response to the appearance of new forms of CMS. These results offered compelling reasons for studies of possible genetic relationships between the PPR-coding genes and newRfloci in radish. Consequently, a BAC radish library screening was performed by macroarray hybridization. This method allows fast access to homologues of theRfogene in the radish genome. Based on the radishRfogene (accession no. AJ535623), a pair of PCR primers (78F/79R) were designed (Supplementary Table S1atJXBonline) to amplify a PCR product of 469bp corresponding to the 1152-1620bp region ofRfob. One PCR product (~500bp) from the male-fertile line 0107H carryingRfob(EU163282) was amplified using 78F/79R, purified, and used as a probe for a screening of the macroarray. Twenty-eight positive BAC clones were identified on macroarrays (Supplementary Fig. S2,Supplementary Table S3). Based on PCR by 78F/79R and sequencing, 18 clones corresponded to theRfolocus. Primer pair 78F/79R did not amplify any product using the other 10 clones as templates, suggesting that these clones contain similar, but not identical, sequences to theRfogene. Then another 10 primer pairs were designed to amplify the correspondingRfoamplicons from the 10 clones. The primer pair P1/P2 amplified ~300bp products in BAC clones 48H19 and 158K3. The sequencing result showed that the 296bp PCR product from 48H19 was identical to that from 158K3 and shared 96% identity with the corresponding region ofRfo. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis showed that 48H19 is ~145kb and 158K3 is ~130kb (Supplementary Fig. S3). Thus the BAC clone 48H19 was sequenced using 454 sequencing technology and 10 contigs were obtained. A contig, composed of 42 567bp, assembled by 8205 reads, contained two predicted PPR genes. One predicted PPR gene of 1440bp showed 90% identity with theRfogene. Based on previous genetic analysis, there should be polymorphism between the sterile line 9802A1 and the fertile line 9606H. Brief sequencing detected two polymorphic sites in predicted promoter and exon regions. Based on these polymorphic sites, two molecular markers were developed. Using the F2population described above, linkage analysis showed that thisPPRlocus co-segregated with theRsRf3locus (Supplementary Table S4). Based on the above contig sequence, a series of primers were designed to amplify the corresponding regions in 9802A1 and 9606H. The alignment of the corresponding sequences between 9802A1 and 9606H revealed a few more polymorphic sites. Additional molecular markers were developed andRsRf3was resolved to a 4kb region containing only one gene using a large F2population with 20 000 plants (Fig. 2). Mapping analysis using the BC1F1 population with 18 000 plants yielded the same result (data not shown). Genetic and physical maps ofRsRf3. RsRf3is mapped to the region between marker N3 and N6, which contains only one gene with homology to At1g63230. The 5' and 3' RACE experiments showed that theRsRf3locus has an intron and encodes a PPR protein with 479 amino acids comprising 11 copies of the 35 amino acid PPR motif. The RsRf3 protein shows 85% similarity with the Rfo protein with 16 PPR domains (Fig. 3). Compared with theRsRf3-1allele in 9802A1, theRsRf3-2allele in 9606H contained one base substitution (C to T) and a CTT insertion at the promoter region. In the coding region, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) results in a single amino acid replacement of arginine (AGG) in 9802A1 by lysine (AAG) in 9606H. Using a strand-specific RT-PCR method, the expression profile ofRsRf3-2in 9606H was assayed using RNA from five tissues. RsRf3-2was detected in all of the tissues at the same expression level (Fig. 4). Interestingly, higherRsRf3expression and RNA polymerase II (Pol II) enrichment were detected at theRsRf3chromatin in F1seedlings compared with its parents (Figs 5,6). Furthermore, the increase in expression and Pol II enrichment was found only in plants carrying the cytoplasm from 9802A1 (Figs 5,6).

ChIP analysis of Pol II on theRsRf3locus. Columns 1, 2, 3, and 4 indicate the patterns of 9802A1, 9606H, F1from 9802A1 (female parent) and 9606H, and F1between from 9802B1 (female parent) and 9606H, respectively. In radish, several types of CMS/Rfsystems have been reported. Ogura CMS is found to be controlled byorf138(BonhommeNone., 1992;Krishnasamy and Makaroff, 1993), and the Kosena CMS-associated geneorf125shares extensive similarity withorf138(IwabuchiNone., 1999). Both Kosena and Ogura CMS are reversed by the same geneorf687(BrownNone., 2003;DesloireNone., 2003;KoizukaNone., 2003). The male-sterile line 9802A1 contains the full-lengthorf138gene; the male-sterile line 9802A1 and its male fertility-restoring line 9606H contain therfobgene that encodes the same predicted protein as the non-restoring allelerf(AJ535624) (WangNone., 2008), suggesting that the CMS/Rfsystem used here (9802A1/9606H) is different from the Ogura/Kosena system. A recent report shows that the Ogura-type mitochondrial genome has been highly rearranged compared with the normal type genome and the rearrangement has resulted in four unique regions containing six open reading frames, includingorf138specific to the Ogura-type mitochondrial genome (TanakaNone., 2012). After the tetrad stage, microspores of Ogura CMS began to degenerate, resulting in empty anthers with no pollen (LeeNone., 2008). In 9802A1, many remnants of microspore exine were found in anthers. Both 9802A1 and the fertility-restored hybrid (9802A1*9606H) show comparable levels oforf138transcripts (Supplementary Fig. S4atJXBonline). The fact that the F1plants of the cross between 9802A1 and 0107H, carryingRfoandRsRf3-1, were male fertile indicates that male sterility in 9802A1 is due toorf138but the restoration is achieved by another set of alleles (RsRf3). The male-sterile phenotype in 9802A1 is also different from other identified cytoplasmic male-sterile radish plants: a small number of pollen grains in the dehiscing anthers are visible in the NWB and DCGMS cytoplasmic male-sterile radish plants (NahmNone., 2005;LeeNone., 2008). A new cytoplasmic male-sterile radish 805A has been identified that possesses two different abortion types in the locules during anther development (ShiNone., 2010). To date, all the PPR-encodingRfgenes function dominantly against their non-functionalrfallele. In this study, positional cloning ofRsRf3was performed and it was found that heterozygousPPRalleles are required for fertility restoration, suggesting that therfallele in the CMS line is functional. How can heterozygousPPRalleles restore male fertility for CMS, but the homozygous allele cannot? Two possibilities are suggested to account for this observation. First, the two PPR proteins encoded by the different alleles at the same locus could show different functions, or a combination of their functions, probably forming a heterodimer, is sufficient to prevent the accumulation of CMS-associated gene products, which is supported by reports that PPR proteins might work as dimers (NakamuraNone., 2003;Okuda and Shikanai, 2012). The second hypothesis is based on the fact that the present work showed that the expression of homozygous alleles is lower than that of the heterozygous alleles. So, the elevated expression of heterozygousPPRalleles may be the reason for reversing the male-sterile phenotype. Both explanations warrant further investigation. Alignment of the BAC clone Bac64 (127kb) containing theRfolocus (rep) and the contig (42kb) carrying theRsRf3locus from BAC clone 48H19 demonstrated that theRfoandRsRf3loci are located in different regions. A BLAST search against theBrassica rapagenome using the two clones indicated that theRfoBAC clone and theRsRf3contig correspond to 7059-7139kb and 7205-7256kb on chromosome 9 fromB. rapa, respectively, suggesting tight linkage between theRfoandRsRf3loci (Supplementary Fig. S5atJXBonline). The heterozygousRsRf3-1/RsRf3-2alleles conditioning gain of function is a rare case which supports the 'overdominance' hypothesis of heterosis proposing that loci exhibit a heterozygote advantage (Crow, 1948). Recent research found thatcispolymorphisms at theFLClocus and theLDMARlocus influence the accumulation of H3K27me3 and DNA methylation, respectively (CousthamNone., 2012;DingNone., 2012). In this work, two polymorphic sites were detected between 9802A1 and 9606H, and higher expression and Pol II enrichment were found in F1plants with the CMS background, suggesting that retrograde regulation, DNA or histone methylations could be involved in transcriptional regulation ofRsRf3.
