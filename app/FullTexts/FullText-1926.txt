DEG/ENaC channel subunits (named after the degenerin MEC-4 and the mammalian epithelial Na+channel;Driscoll and Chalfie, 1991;Canessa et al., 1993) contain two transmembrane domains, a large extracellular loop and short intracellular N and C termini that form trimeric voltage-independent Na+or/and Ca2+channels. Crystal structure analysis of chicken ASIC1a revealed that three DEG/ENaC subunits come together to form a channel, and that the large extracellular domain of each subunit forms a "clenched-hand" structure that protrudes from the plasma membrane (Jasti et al., 2007). Structural and functional analysis has shown that this extracellular domain specifies channel regulation by protons and other ions, and that it undergoes substantial movement during channel gating (Jasti et al., 2007;Zhang et al., 2008;Li et al., 2009;Passero et al., 2009;Sherwood et al., 2009;Wang and Bianchi, 2009;Shi et al., 2011). DEG/ENaC channels are comprised of either homomeric or heteromeric trimers, and at least some DEG/ENaC channels are associated with auxiliary subunits (Lingueglia et al., 1997;Bianchi and Driscoll, 2002;Chelur et al., 2002;Goodman et al., 2002;Askwith et al., 2004). DEG/ENaC channels are expressed in a wide variety of cell types including epithelial cells (Canessa et al., 1993), neurons (Bianchi and Driscoll, 2002), and glia (Wang et al., 2008;Hitomi et al., 2009;Calavia et al., 2010;Han et al., 2013), where they function to mediate physiological processes as diverse as Na+reabsorption (Hummler et al., 1996), memory formation, and sensory perception (Tavernarakis et al., 1997;Price et al., 2000,2001;Sluka et al., 2003;Wemmie et al., 2003;Wang et al., 2008;Chandrashekar et al., 2010). Some DEG/ENaC channels, includingCaenorhabditis elegansMEC-4 and mammalian ASIC1a, have been shown to undergo "hyperactivation" as a result of genetic mutations (Driscoll and Chalfie, 1991;Garcia-Anoveros et al., 1995) and chronic exposure to protons (Xiong et al., 2004), respectively. In these conditions, DEG/ENaC channels switch to a high open probability mode that results in large whole cell currents (Goodman et al., 2002;Brown et al., 2007). The resultant influx of cations induces cell swelling and death through a mechanism that involves release of calcium from the ER and activation of calcium-sensitive proteases such as calpains and cathepsins (Xu et al., 2001;Syntichaki et al., 2002). Interestingly, bothC. elegansMEC-4 and mouse ASIC1a show some calcium permeability, suggesting that, at least in some cases, calcium influx through hyperactivated DEG/ENaCs triggers the cell death program (Zhang and Canessa, 2002;Bianchi et al., 2004;Xiong et al., 2004). Mutations in theC. elegansDEG/ENaC subunit UNC-8 have been isolated in genetic screens as uncoordinated animals (Brenner, 1974;Park and Horvitz, 1986;Shreffler et al., 1995). The dominant mutants,unc-8(n491)andunc-8(e15), of which both encode the single mutation UNC-8(G387E), display a strong backward movement defect. Microscopic analysis ofunc-8(n491)andunc-8(e15)animals detected neuronal swelling during early larval development (Shreffler et al., 1995). Similar cell swelling resulting from hyperactivated DEG/ENaC channels such as MEC-4(d) (Driscoll and Chalfie, 1991) suggests thatunc-8(n491)andunc-8(e15)may encode constitutively active UNC-8 channels. Cell swelling in theseunc-8(d)mutants is less severe, however, than that observed formec-4(d)animals. In addition, a majority of the affected motor neurons inunc-8(d)mutants appear to recover by the adult stage, whereas neurons that express MEC-4(d) channels typically undergo necrotic cell death (Driscoll and Chalfie, 1991;Shreffler et al., 1995). A milder neurotoxic phenotype is also caused by expression of MEC-10(d) in touch neurons (Huang and Chalfie, 1994). MEC-10 cannot form channels on its own but associates with MEC-4 to modulate its properties (Goodman et al., 2002). Thus, the milder neurotoxic phenotype of MEC-10(d) was interpreted to be the result of the MEC-10 accessory role in the channel complex. We undertook this study to better define the neuronal toxicity ofunc-8(n491),unc-8(e15), andunc-8(n49)(encoding A586T mutation) mutants and to establish the physiological properties of UNC-8(d) channels that they encode. We show that DA and DB motor neurons swell inunc-8(n491)L1 larval stage and that ?35% of them degenerate by adulthood. We also show by expression inXenopus laevisoocytes that UNC-8 forms homomeric channels and that neurotoxic UNC-8 mutations induce channel hyperactivation. However, we found that the overall current amplitude is small because of the high affinity blockage of UNC-8 channels by extracellular divalent cations. Removal of divalent cations results in strong currents and inducesXenopusoocyte cell death. Expression of an UNC-8 intragenic mutation that suppresses neuronal swelling reduces current amplitude. UNC-8(A586T), which corresponds to the relatively weakunc-8(n49)allele, is inhibited by extracellular calcium and acidic pH with higher affinity than the more toxic UNC-8(G387E). Collectively, our data are consistent with the proposal that hyperactive cation transport accounts for the neurotoxicity of UNC-8 gain-of-function mutants, and that this activity is likely regulated in vivo by extracellular divalent cations and pH. Nematode strains were maintained at 20 degrees C on standard nematode growth medium seeded withEscherichia colistrain OP50 (Brenner, 1974). Wild-type animals were N2 Bristol. Strains used in this work include:CZ1200 (juIs76 [unc-25p::GFP+ lin-15(+)] II;lin-15B(n765) X)to label GABA motor neurons with GFP and RP1(trIs10 [myo-3p::MB::YFP + myo-2p::YFP + ceh-23::HcRed + unc-25::dsRed+ unc-129nsp::CFP]I) to label GABA motor neurons with dsRed and cholinergic DA/DB neurons with CFP. unc-8(n491)IV was crossed into the marker strains to generateNC2782 [punc-25::GFP(II); unc-8(n491) IV]andNC2799 [unc-8(n491) IV; trIs10 [myo-3p::MB::YFP + myo-2p::YFP + ceh-23::HcRed + unc-25::DsRed + unc-129nsp::CFP] I]. Animals were immobilized with 15 mM levamisole on 2% agarose pads with M9 buffer as described previously (Smith et al., 2012). L1 animals were imaged with a microscope (Axioplan; Carl Zeiss) equipped with a camera (ORCA; Hammamatsu) and ImageJ Micro-Manager software. DIC images of ventral cord motor neurons were collected with a 100* oil objective; young adult animals were evaluated with a 63* oil objective. Images inFig. 1 (C and D)were acquired with a confocal microscope (TCS SP5; Leica). Z stacks were collected with a 40* oil objective (1 um/step). Single-plane projections were generated with Application Suite Advanced Fluorescence software (Leica). Insets of the CFP-labeled DA/DB neurons shown inFig. 1 (C and D)were generated with the ImageJ plug-in "straighten curved objects" (Kocsis et al., 1991). Image overlays were performed with Adobe Photoshop. To evaluate ventral cord motor neurons in the L1 stage for potential swelling,punc-25::GFP was used to mark GABA neurons in wild-type andunc-8(n491)animals. To generate synchronized populations of L1 larvae, 100 wild-type (CZ1200) andNC2782 [punc-25::GFP;unc-8(n491)]adults were picked to single 60-mm plates and allowed to lay eggs for 1 h. The midpoint of the hour was considered to be t = 0. Plates were maintained at 20 degrees C. At 18 h after lay, early L1 animals were picked from plates and imaged (as above) on a microscope (Axioplan; Carl Zeiss). RP1 (trIs10)was used to visualize embryonic motor neurons (DA, DB, DD) in the ventral nerve cord in wild-type andunc-8(n491)adults. CFP-labeled DA/DB neurons and dsRed-labeled DD neurons were scored in the ventral cord regions between DD1 through DD6. Results were pooled from three separate experiments. UNC-8 cDNA was cloned by RT-PCR using the one-step RT-PCR kit Titanium (Takara Bio Inc.) in two parts. We cloned the last ?1,500 bp (from the HincII site to the stop codon) using UNC-8-specific primers designed according to the UNC-8-predicted cDNA sequence available on WormBase, and the 5' end (up to the HincII site) using a reverse-specific primer and the splice leader primer SL1 (Graham et al., 1988) (Fig. S2). Total RNA from aC. elegansmixed-age population was used as template. PCR products were initially cloned into TOPO PCR2.1 vector for sequence verification and amplification. Sequence-verified cDNA fragments were then ligated together into PGEM vector (Goodman et al., 2002) to reconstitute the full-length UNC-8 cDNA. Mutations were introduced in UNC-8 cDNA sequence using the Quickchange mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies) according to the manufacturer's procedures. Mutant DNA were then sequenced and used for in vitro cRNA synthesis. cRNAs were synthesized using T7 mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit (Invitrogen). cRNAs were then purified and run on denaturating agarose gels for size and integrity verification. cRNA quantification was performed spectroscopically. Stage V-VI oocytes were selected among multi-staged oocytes dissected by a 2-h collagenase treatment (2 mg/ml in Ca2+-free OR2 solution) fromXenopusovaries (provided by G. Dahl or C.W. Luetje, University of Miami, Coral Gables, FL). Oocytes were injected with 10 ng/oocyte of each cRNA and incubated in OR2 medium plus 300 uM amiloride. OR2 solution consists of 82.5 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM Na2HPO4, 0.5 g/liter polyvinyl pyrolidone, and 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml) and 2 mM Na-pyruvate at 20 degrees C for 2-3 d before recordings. Currents were measured using a two-electrode voltage-clamp amplifier (GeneClamp 500B; Axon Instruments) at room temperature. Electrodes (0.2-0.5 MOmega) were filled with 3 M KCl, and oocytes were perfused with a physiological NaCl solution containing (mM) 100 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.2. The divalent cation-free plus EGTA NaCl solution contained (mM): 110 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1 EGTA, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.2. CaCl2was added to this solution to reach the desired concentrations (Schoenmakers et al., 1992). pH was adjusted at the indicated values using NMDG-Cl or HCl. When we tested solutions at pH lower than 6, we used 10 mM Mes instead of 10 mM HEPES to buffer the solutions. The divalent cation-free NaCl solution contained (mM): 110 NaCl, 2 KCl, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.2. MgCl2was added to this solution to reach the desired concentrations. The solution to test calcium permeability contained (mM): 73 CaCl2, 2 KCl, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.2. The solutions to test UNC-8(G387E) selectivity contained (mM): 112 NaCl (LiCl, KCl, or NMDG-Cl), 1 EGTA, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.2. The oocyte membrane was clamped at -30 mV and stepped from -160 to +100 mV. Amiloride was added to the solutions from a stock of 10 mM, except for when 1 and 5 mM amiloride were used. In this case, amiloride was dissolved directly into the perfusing solution. Saturating concentration of amiloride (1 and 5 mM for experiments in physiological and divalent-free solutions, respectively) was added at the end of each experiment to make sure that endogenous/leak currents were similar in amplitude to noninjected oocytes within each oocyte batch. Oocytes that had larger endogenous/leak currents were not further analyzed. We used the pCLAMP suite of programs (Axon Instruments) for data acquisition and analysis. Currents were filtered at 200 Hz and sampled at 1 kHz. Occytes were incubated in regular OR2 or OR2 containing 5 uM Ca2+plus or minus 500 uM amiloride for 24 h in individual wells (96-well plate), after injection with UNC-8 wild-type and UNC-8(G387E) cRNAs and overnight incubation in regular OR2. After a 24-h incubation, oocytes were examined under the dissection microscope to establish if they were still intact. Oocytes were scored as "intact" if no cytoplasmic material was visible outside the oocyte. Fig. S1 shows the fraction ofunc-8(n491)animals that lack a given DA, DB, or DD motor neuron versus the location of each motor neuron along the ventral nerve cord from anterior (DD1) to posterior (DD6). Fig. S2 shows UNC-8 protein sequence and alignment with other DEG/ENaC channels,unc-8gene structure, sequence of the first two exons, and corresponding translation and location of the mutations studied. The online supplemental material is available athttp://www.jgp.org/cgi/content/full/jgp.201310974/DC1. We observed significant cell swelling in the ventral nerve cords ofunc-8(n491)L1 stage larvae (Fig. 1). Swollen cells were visible in mostunc-8(n491)animals at this stage but were rarely observed later in larval development. Swollen cells were also detected in other body regions (e.g., PVC neuron). Our results agree with a previous report that described transient swelling in the ventral nerve cord of L1 stageunc-8(n491)andunc-8(e15)animals (Shreffler et al., 1995). The ventral nerve cords of newly hatched L1 larvae contain three types of motor neurons: the cholinergic DAs (nine neurons), DBs (seven neurons), and GABAergic DDs (six neurons). We relied on the invariant locations of each member of these motor neuron classes (White et al., 1986) and the GABA-specific marker,unc-25::GFP, to determine that swelling is limited to DA and DB motor neurons and was never observed for the DD class inunc-8(n491)L1 animals (Fig. 1 B). We also noted occasional swelling of P cell precursors in the ventral nerve cord (Fig. 1 B). The motor neuron-specific effects are correlated with our finding that a fraction of DA and DB motor neurons (?36%) is missing from the adult ventral nerve cord, but no absences were observed for DD motor neurons (Fig. 1, C-E, andFig. S1). The death of DA and DB motor neurons was not previously detected from counts of ventral cord cell nuclei stained with the DNA dye DAPI perhaps because this effect is limited to less than 10% of all ventral cord motor neurons in the adult and therefore difficult to detect with this approach (Shreffler et al., 1995). Our results suggest that constitutive UNC-8 activity can result in cell death and is thus consistent with similar observations for dominant mutants of the DEG/ENaC channels DEG-1 and MEC-4 (Chalfie and Wolinsky, 1990;Driscoll and Chalfie, 1991).

Insets show linearized view of DA/DB motor neurons. Bars, 25 um. (E) GABAergic and DA/DB motor neurons were counted in the ventral cord region between DD1 and DD6 (arrowheads in C and D; see also Fig. S1). unc-8(n491)animals (n= 14) contain the full complement of 19 DD/VD GABAergic motor neurons but are missing a significant fraction (?36%) of the 11 DA/DB motor neurons from this region of the adult ventral nerve cord (wild type;n= 24). ***, P = 3 * E-11 byttest. Tavernarakis et al. (1997)showed thatunc-8encodes a DEG/ENaC subunit and that bothn491ande15alleles contain the G387E mutation. G387 is located in the UNC-8 extracellular domain in a poorly conserved loop of the "finger" domain (Gessmann et al., 2010) (Fig. S2, A and C). The neuronal swelling phenotype typical of neurons expressing hyperactive DEG/ENaC channels such as MEC-4(d) (Driscoll and Chalfie, 1991) suggested that the G387E mutation may result in a hyperactive UNC-8 channel. To test this hypothesis, we cloned UNC-8 cDNA for heterologous expression inXenopusoocytes. Using the splice leader sequence primer SL1 (Graham et al., 1988), we identified an UNC-8 transcript that differed from the predicted gene structure (WormBase) in its first two exons (Fig. S2 B) as the most abundant UNC-8 mRNA. Using this UNC-8 cDNA as a template, we generated the UNC-8(G387E) mutant and expressed wild-type and mutant UNC-8 inXenopusoocytes for electrophysiological analysis. We found that oocytes injected with wild-type UNC-8 did not produce currents above the background level. In contrast, UNC-8(G387E)-injected oocytes expressed an amiloride-sensitive current that reversed at ?0 mV (Fig. 2, A-D). These results are consistent with the idea that the G387E mutation enhances UNC-8 channel cation transport above the wild-type level and thus corresponds to a "hyperactive" mutation. From a dose-response curve, we calculated an amiloride Ki of 7.8 uM at -100 mV, as expected for a current that depends on DEG/ENaC channel activity (Fig. 2 E). Interestingly, UNC-8(G387E) currents displayed a strong outward rectification with larger values for positive potentials than for voltage clamps below 0 mV. Amiloride-sensitive currents in UNC-8(G387E)-expressing oocytes. (A) Example of ionic currents recorded in an oocyte expressing UNC-8(G387E) perfused with a NaCl physiological solution. Currents were elicited by voltage steps from -160 to +100 mV in 20-mV increments. The holding potential was -30 mV. (B) The same oocyte shown in A was perfused with NaCl physiological solution plus 1 mM amiloride. (C) Amiloride-sensitive currents. Currents obtained by subtracting the amiloride-resistant current from the total current are shown here. Dashed lines represent the zero current level. The outward amiloride-resistant current is likely oocytes endogenous current, which varies in amplitude from batch to batch of oocytes. (D) Current-voltage relationship of amiloride-sensitive currents in UNC-8(G387E)-expressing oocytes (n= 5). Note the strong inward rectification at negative voltages. The solid line represents the amiloride-sensitive current recorded from an oocyte injected with wild-type UNC-8. (E) Amiloride dose-response curve. Currents recorded in amiloride at -100 mV were normalized against the currents recorded in NaCl physiological solution at -100 mV. Data points were fitted by Hill equation, which gave a Ki of 7.8 uM and annvalue of 0.5 (n= 6). Data are expressed as mean +/- SE. The outward rectification of the amiloride-sensitive current in UNC-8(G387E)-expressing oocytes (Fig. 2 D) resembles that of other hyperactive DEG/ENaC channels includingC. elegansUNC-105(d) and MEC-4(d) (Garcia-Anoveros et al., 1998;Bianchi et al., 2004;Brown et al., 2008) that are negatively regulated by extracellular calcium. To test UNC-8(G387E) for similar regulation, we perfused oocytes with a solution prepared without divalent cations, and with a solution without divalent cations to which 1 mM EGTA was added to chelate residual calcium. In these divalent cation-free solutions, the UNC-8(G387E) current did not rectify and showed a linear response to voltage from -160 to +100 mV (Fig. 3, A-D). Strikingly, currents were also ?20 times larger both when the membrane was hyperpolarized and depolarized, suggesting that both inward and outward currents are blocked by divalent cations (Fig. 3 D). This behavior differs significantly from that of UNC-105(d) and MEC-4(d) channels for which inhibition by extracellular calcium is limited to currents at negative membrane potentials. We conducted similar experiments in divalent cation-free solution for oocytes injected with wild-type UNC-8 but did not detect currents above the oocyte background level, even when twice as much cRNA was injected (Fig. 3 Dand not depicted). These results suggest that wild-type UNC-8 requires a specific stimulus to be activated. Several members of the DEG/ENaC family are gated by extracellular protons (Bianchi and Driscoll, 2002). Thus, we tested whether wild-type UNC-8 was activated by perfusion with a solution at pH 5. However, we found no increase of currents above the background level, suggesting that UNC-8 is gated by stimuli other than protons (not depicted). One possibility is that UNC-8 is gated by mechanical forces, as suggested byTavernarakis et al. (1997). UNC-8(G387E) currents are larger in divalent cation-free solution. (A) Example of currents recorded in an oocyte injected with UNC-8(G387E) and perfused with NaCl physiological solution, which contains 1 mM CaCl2and 2 mM MgCl2. Currents were stimulated by voltage steps from -160 to +100 mV in 20-mV increments. The holding potential was -30 mV. (B) The same oocyte shown in A was perfused with a divalent cation-free NaCl solution containing 1 mM EGTA. Currents were recorded with the same voltage protocol used in A. (C) Currents were recorded from the same oocyte in divalent cation-free EGTA solution plus 1 mM amiloride. Dashed lines represent the zero current level. (D) Current-voltage relationships from noninjected oocytes and oocytes injected with UNC-8 or UNC-8(G387E), and perfused with either the NaCl physiological solution or the divalent cation-free or divalent cation-free plus EGTA NaCl solution, as indicated. The number of oocytes tested is shown in parentheses. (E) Shift in the oocyte resting potential upon switching from NaCl physiological solution (1 mM CaCl2and 2 mM MgCl2) to divalent cation-free plus EGTA NaCl solution for noninjected oocytes (open squares;n= 9) and oocytes injected with UNC-8(G387E) (closed circles;n= 32). Small symbols and lines correspond to measurement from individual oocytes, and large symbols are means +/- SE. (F) Amiloride dose-response curve obtained from oocytes injected with UNC-8(G387E) and perfused with divalent cation-free plus EGTA NaCl solution. Data points were fitted by Hill equation, which gave a Ki of 106 uM and annvalue of 1. The inset shows the voltage dependence of amiloride blockade. Data points were fitted using the Woodhull model, which gave a delta of 0.08 (Woodhull, 1973). Data are expressed as mean +/- SE (n= 8). Because removal of extracellular divalent cations results in a large increase in UNC-8(G387E) current, we predicted that the resting potential of these oocytes would become more depolarized, consistent with Na+becoming the predominant cation transported into the oocyte, upon perfusion with the divalent cation-free plus EGTA solution. Indeed, we found that oocytes injected with UNC-8(G387E) underwent a significant depolarization with the switch from physiological to divalent cation-free plus EGTA NaCl solution. Conversely, noninjected oocytes depolarized only a few millivolts under the same experimental conditions (Fig. 3 E). Amiloride binding was substantially weakened in the divalent cation-free plus EGTA solution with a Ki of 106 uM (compareFig. 3 FwithFig. 2 E). Interestingly, although amiloride binding appears to display negative cooperativity in physiological solution (fit with Hill's equation,n= 0.5;Fig. 2 E), it shows no cooperativity in the divalent cation-free plus EGTA solution (n= 1). Collectively, these results suggest that extracellular divalent cations influence amiloride binding and/or blockage. Although UNC-8(G387E) generates strongly outwardly rectifying currents, MEC-4(d) currents are not outwardly rectifying (Goodman et al., 2002). Moreover, although removal of divalent cations from the extracellular solution has little effect on MEC-4(d) currents, UNC-8(G387E) currents are increased greater than 20-fold by this treatment (Fig. 3, A-D) (Bianchi et al., 2004;Brown et al., 2008). Interestingly, although MEC-4(d) causes death of all six touch neurons in which it is expressed, UNC-8(G387E) appears to kill only a fraction of DA/DB motor neurons (Fig. 1 Eand Fig. S1). Thus, we hypothesized that the amplitude of the current may reflect the level of toxicity of these two mutant channels. We also predicted that relief or reduction of the divalent block of UNC-8(G387E) would exacerbate toxicity. To test this idea, we incubatedXenopusoocytes expressing UNC-8(G387E) in OR2 solution containing only 5 uM Ca2+and no Mg2+; 68% of these oocytes appeared swollen and burst after 24 h of incubation. In contrast, the same treatment did not cause bursting of noninjected oocytes or oocytes injected with wild-type UNC-8 (Fig. 4, A and B). The addition of 500 uM amiloride was protective and rescued oocytes from bursting (Fig. 4 B). These results suggest that the block exerted by divalent cations limits the toxicity of the UNC-8(G387E) mutant channel. Cell death and UNC-8(d) permeability properties. (A) Representative photographs of a noninjected oocyte (top), oocyte-injected UNC-8 wild type, and an UNC-8(G387E) (middle and bottom panels, respectively) incubated for 24 h in OR2 solution containing 5 uM calcium and no magnesium. Note the lysis of the oocyte-expressing UNC-8(G387E). (B) Quantification of the ratio of oocytes that are intact after a 24-h treatment in OR2 containing 5 uM calcium. Values are averages of four independent injections with 10 oocytes in each replicate. Amiloride was added to a final concentration of 500 uM. Values are mean +/- SE. **, P less than = 0.01 by ANOVA. (C) Example of currents recorded in a noninjected oocyte (top) and an oocyte injected with UNC-8(G387E) perfused with a solution whose only permeant cation was calcium. Voltage steps were from -160 to -40 mV from a holding potential of 0 mV. (D) Average current amplitudes at -160 recorded from noninjected oocytes and oocytes injected with UNC-8(G387E) perfused with the calcium solution. Note that the oocyte-endogenous Ca2+-activated Cl-current is not activated in either sample (Bianchi et al., 2004). Data are expressed as mean +/- SE (n= 8). NS, not statistically different. (E) Average current amplitude recorded at -100 mV in oocytes injected with UNC-8(G387E) perfused the solutions indicated on the x axis. Data are expressed as mean +/- SE (n= 12, 12, 12, and 9, respectively). Neurotoxic DEG/ENaC channels MEC-4(d) and ASIC1a show some permeability to Ca2+ions (Bianchi et al., 2004;Xiong et al., 2004). However, it is not clear whether Ca2+permeability is necessary for DEG/ENaC-induced neurotoxicity. We tested whether neurotoxic UNC-8(G387E) is Ca2+permeable by perfusing oocytes with a CaCl2solution and by monitoring the activation of the endogenous Ca2+-activated Cl-current (Bianchi et al., 2004). However, we did not detect currents above the background level (Fig. 4, C and D), indicating that UNC-8(G387E) is not permeable to Ca2+ions. We further analyzed UNC-8(G387E) selectivity properties by measuring current amplitude in oocytes perfused with extracellular solutions in which NaCl was replaced with LiCl, KCl, and NMDG-Cl. We found that the selectivity series for UNC-8(G387E) for monovalent cations was Na+ greater than Li+ greater than K+ greater than greater than NMDG+(Fig. 4 E). The relatively high K+permeability may explain why the reversal potential of the UNC-8(G387E) was closer to 0 mV than expected for a selective Na+channel. To conclude, UNC-8(G387E) is permeable to both Na+and K+, but it is not permeable to the larger monovalent cation NMDG+or to the divalent cation Ca2+. For quantitative measurements of calcium and magnesium affinity, we measured UNC-8(G387E) currents while perfusing the oocytes with increasing concentrations of each divalent cation. These experiments showed that UNC-8(G387E) is blocked by extracellular calcium with a Ki of 6 uM at -100 mV (Fig. 5, A-C). To establish whether calcium binds the channel within the membrane electric field, we determined the voltage dependence of Ki. By fitting data points with the Woodhull model (Woodhull, 1973), we established that the calcium-binding site in UNC-8(G387E) is 6% within the membrane electric field (Fig. 5 D). Note that Ca2+blocks the outward current as well (Fig. 5 B). This result suggests either that Ca2+binds within a crevice of the channel from where it cannot escape during membrane depolarization, or that the channel changes conformation once Ca2+is bound, thereby trapping the ion. On the basis of these results, we conclude that Ca2+block of the outward current likely accounts for the inhibition of outward current in physiological solution. UNC-8(G387E) calcium and magnesium sensitivity. (A) Example of ionic currents recorded in an oocyte injected with UNC-8(G387E) and perfused with the divalent cation-free plus EGTA NaCl solution. The voltage protocol fromFig. 3 Awas used here. (B) The same oocyte was perfused with the NaCl solution containing 10 uM CaCl2. (C) Calcium dose-response curve. Currents were recorded at -100 mV in oocytes perfused with increasing concentrations of extracellular calcium. Currents in the presence of calcium were normalized for the current recorded in the same oocyte in divalent cation-free plus EGTA NaCl solution. Before normalization, all currents were leak subtracted. Data points were fitted with a sigmoidal curve for a Ki of 6 uM (n= 8). (D) Voltage dependence of calcium block. The Ki for calcium was plotted against the voltage. Data points were fitted using the Woodhull model; the delta value was 0.06 (n= 7). (E) Same as in A, except that the divalent-free solution did not contain EGTA. (F) The same oocyte shown in E was perfused with the NaCl solution containing 500 uM MgCl2. (G) Magnesium dose-response curve. Data points were derived as in C. Fitting with a sigmoidal curve gave a Ki value of 598 uM (n= 11). (H) The Ki for magnesium block was plotted against the voltage. Data points were fitted by the Woodhull model; the delta value was 0.13 (n= 9). UNC-8(G387E) was blocked by magnesium with a Ki of 598 uM at -100 mV (Fig. 5, E-G). Interestingly, the voltage dependence of magnesium blockage is suggestive of a binding site deeper within the membrane electric field as compared with calcium. Indeed, by fitting data points with the Woodhull model, we obtained a delta of 0.13 (delta was 0.06 for calcium) (Fig. 5 H). Interestingly, Mg2+does not block the outward current (Fig. 5 F), suggesting that Mg2+is dislocated from its binding site upon depolarization. Collectively, our data show that UNC-8(G387E) is blocked by extracellular calcium and magnesium. However, the channel is more sensitive to calcium, and the two ions appear to bind to different sites within the channel: calcium binds a more external site, whereas magnesium binds to a location deeper within the pore, consistent with the smaller size of the magnesium ion. We next wondered whether UNC-8(G387E) high sensitivity to extracellular divalent cations is a general feature of UNC-8 or if it is related to this specific mutation. To discriminate between these two possibilities, we expressed a second UNC-8 mutant protein, UNC-8(A586T), inXenopusoocytes (Tavernarakis et al., 1997). The A586T missense mutation is located in the extracellular region (Fig. S2). A586T is encoded by thee49allele, which also results in uncoordinated movement (Shreffler et al., 1995). Our measurements showed that UNC-8(A586T) produces outwardly rectifying currents that are 20 times larger in the absence of divalent cations than in physiological NaCl solution (Fig. 6, A-D). These results support the idea that the blockage by extracellular divalent cations is likely an intrinsic feature of UNC-8 channels. Calcium and magnesium block UNC-8(A586T) currents. (A) Example of currents stimulated by voltage steps from -160 to +100 mV in an oocyte injected with UNC-8(A586T); the holding potential was -30 mV. The oocyte was perfused with a physiological NaCl solution containing 1 mM CaCl2and 2 mM MgCl2. (B) Average current-voltage relationships obtained from currents similar to the ones shown in A (n= 6). (C) The same oocyte shown in A was perfused with the divalent cation-free plus EGTA NaCl solution. (D) Average current-voltage relationship obtained from currents similar to the ones shown in C (n= 6). An intragenic suppressor mutation was isolated in a genetic screen for mutations that influenceunc-8(d)-induced neuronal swelling (Shreffler et al., 1995). H114Y (e15lb129allele) suppresses the Unc-8(d) neuronal swelling and uncoordinated phenotypes in either the cis or trans configuration to the G387E mutation. This result is consistent with a model in which the H114Y mutation disrupts either assembly or function of UNC-8 in a multimeric channel. H114 corresponds to a highly conserved residue located in the intracellular N-terminal region adjacent to the first transmembrane domain (Fig. S2, A and C). Based on our results, we reasoned that H114Y may reduce neuronal damage by suppressing UNC-8(G387E) currents. To test this idea, we coexpressed UNC-8(H114Y) with UNC-8(G387E) inXenopusoocytes and analyzed current amplitudes. We found that UNC-8(G387E) plus UNC-8(H114Y) currents were smaller than that of UNC-8(G387E) alone (Fig. 7, A-C). In fact, UNC-8(G387E) currents were suppressed ?85% by coexpression with UNC-8(H114Y). Consistent with a smaller current amplitude, the membrane potential of these oocytes on average depolarized to a lower potential upon switching to a divalent cation-free plus EGTA solution as compared with oocytes injected with UNC-8(G387E) alone (compareFig. 7 DwithFig. 3 E). To test the effect of H114Y mutation within the same UNC-8 subunit (in cis), we built the UNC-8(G387E/H114Y) double mutant. We found that these channels were not functional in oocytes (Fig. 7 C). Notably, UNC-8(H114Y) did not produce currents when expressed alone, suggesting that this mutant subunit is not hyperactivated (Fig. 7 C). Interestingly, wild-type UNC-8 also suppressed UNC-8(G387E) currents but by a lower degree, which is consistent with the lower neurotoxicity observed inunc-8(n491)/+heterozygotes (Shreffler and Wolinsky, 1997). Current suppression by UNC-8(H114Y) could be the result of effects on channel function or trafficking to the cell surface. In any case, our data are consistent with the idea that the level of neurotoxicity of hyperactivated UNC-8 is defined by the amplitude of UNC-8 mutant ionic current. UNC-8(H114Y), the trans-suppressor of UNC-(G387E) neuronal swelling, suppresses UNC-8(G387E) currents. (A) Example of currents recorded from an oocyte injected with UNC-8(G387E). (B) Example of currents recorded from an oocyte injected with UNC-8(G387E) plus UNC-8(H11Y). Both oocytes were perfused with the divalent cation-free plus EGTA NaCl solution. Currents were elicited by voltage steps from -160 to +100 mV in 20-mV increments from a holding potential of -30 mV. The dashed line corresponds to the zero current level. (C) Average current amplitudes at -160 mV recorded from oocytes injected with UNC-8(G387E) (n= 23), noninjected oocytes (n= 14), wild-type UNC-8 (n= 17), UNC-8(H114Y) (n= 23), UNC-8(G387E) plus UNC-8(wt) (n= 11), UNC-8(G387E) plus UNC-8(H114Y) (n= 23), and UNC-8(G387E/H114Y) (n= 13). **, P less than = 0.01 by ANOVA. (D) Mean change in resting potential upon switch from NaCl physiological solution containing 1 mM CaCl2and 2 mM MgCl2to the divalent cation-free plus EGTA NaCl solution in oocytes injected with UNC-8(H114Y) (open diamonds;n= 5) and in oocytes injected with UNC-8(G387E) plus UNC-8(H114Y) (closed diamonds;n= 13). Allelen49, which encodes the A586T mutation, causes a less severe uncoordinated phenotype than then491ande15alleles that encode G387E mutation (Shreffler et al., 1995). This difference is caused by a lower number of swollen neurons inn49versusn491ande15mutants (Shreffler et al., 1995). Based on our results, we hypothesized that in vivo cationic currents through UNC-8(A586T) channels should be smaller than currents through UNC-8(G387E). We thus compared current amplitudes in oocytes expressing UNC-8(A586T) and UNC-8(G387E), perfused with a divalent cation-free plus EGTA solution. However, we found no statistical difference (10.1 +/- 1.8 and 13.3 +/- 3.1 uA for A586T and G387E, respectively, at -100 mV, expressed as mean +/- SD;n= 9 and 15). We next tested whether calcium sensitivity was different in the two mutants. Indeed, because calcium inhibits UNC-8(d) currents, a different sensitivity to this divalent cation could manifest in different current amplitude in vivo. We found that the Ki for calcium was 1.66 uM at -100 mV, which is lower than the Ki we determined for G387E mutant (6 uM at -100 mV). We next wondered whether UNC-8(G387E) and UNC-8(A586T) currents were sensitive to pH and if a difference in pH sensitivity could contribute to the difference in the in vivo phenotypes. We analyzed UNC-8(G387E) and UNC-8(A586T) pH sensitivity inXenopusoocytes perfused with solutions with a pH ranging from 5 to 8. We found that both currents were inhibited by acidic pH. However, although UNC-8(G387E) pH0.5was 5.6, UNC-8(A586T) pH0.5was 6.6 (Fig. 8). These data suggest that a smaller fraction of UNC-8(G387E) channels than UNC-8(A586T) channels is inhibited at physiological pH. This effect could account for the observation thatunc-8(n491)andunc-8(e15)corresponding to the G387E mutation result in more neuronal swelling than theunc-8(n49)allele that encodes UNC-8(A586T). To conclude, our results show that UNC-8(d) is inhibited by acidic pH and suggest that differences both in calcium and pH sensitivity between the G387E and A586T mutant proteins could contribute to their different toxicities in vivo. pH sensitivity of neurotoxic UNC-8 mutants. (A) Example of currents stimulated by voltage steps from -160 to +100 mV in an oocyte injected with UNC-8(G387E); the holding potential was -30 mV. The oocyte was perfused with the divalent cation-free plus EGTA NaCl solution at pH 7.2. (B) The same oocyte shown in A was perfused with the divalent cation-free plus EGTA NaCl solution at pH 6.5. (C and D) Same as in A and B for an oocyte expressing UNC-8(A586T). (E) pH dose-response curves for oocytes expressing UNC-8(G387E) (closed circles;n= 22) and UNC-8(A586T) (closed squares;n= 14), respectively. Before normalization, all currents were leak subtracted. Data points were fitted by sigmoidal curves that gave pH0.5values of 5.6 and 6.6 for UNC-8(G387E) and UNC-8(A586T), respectively. We undertook this study to better characterize neurotoxic mutants of theC. elegansDEG/ENaC channel UNC-8 and to establish whether a correlation exists between their level of toxicity and channel properties. By expression inXenopusoocytes, we show that neurotoxic UNC-8(d) mutations induce channel hyperactivation. The strong block exerted by extracellular divalent cations on UNC-8(d) channels diminishes current amplitude and could therefore account for limiting the cellular toxicity of UNC-8(d) channels. Indeed, reduction of extracellular divalent cations concentration resulted in swelling and death ofXenopusoocytes expressing UNC-8(d) channels. Further evidence that the current amplitude through the mutant UNC-8 channels defines their level of toxicity is provided by the our findings that: (a) coexpression with an UNC-8 intragenic mutation that suppresses neuronal swelling reduces current amplitude, and (b) the less toxic mutation, UNC-8(A586T), is associated with higher sensitivity to calcium and acidic pH and is therefore expected to produce smaller currents in vivo. Collectively, our data are consistent with the idea that the neurotoxicity of UNC-8 gain-of-function mutants is caused by hyperactive cation transport and that this effect may be quelled in vivo by extracellular divalent cations and pH. Hyperactivated DEG/ENaC channels can induce swelling and death of the cells in which they are expressed (Driscoll and Chalfie, 1991;Huang and Chalfie, 1994;Xiong et al., 2004). For example, hyperactivation of mouse ASIC1a by prolonged stroke-induced tissue acidosis contributes to neuronal demise (Xiong et al., 2004). Similarly, a mutation in the pore domain hyperactivates theC. elegansMEC-4 channel and results in the swelling and death of the touch neurons in which MEC-4 is expressed (Driscoll and Chalfie, 1991;Goodman et al., 2002). Excess ion influx caused by hyperactivation of DEG/ENaCs is thought to result in an ionic imbalance that is ultimately toxic to the cell. MEC-4(d) and ASIC1a have been shown to be calcium permeable, suggesting that at least some neurotoxic DEG/ENaC channels contribute directly to elevation of intracellular calcium and/or trigger calcium release from the ER (Bianchi et al., 2004;Xiong et al., 2004). Blockage of hyperactivated DEG/ENaC channels by the application of amiloride or PcTx1 toxin, an ASIC1-specific inhibitor, significantly improves neuronal survival, supporting the idea that ion influx through these channels is the trigger for neuronal death (Bianchi et al., 2004;Xiong et al., 2004). However, to what extent the amount of Na+and/or Ca2+influx is toxic and what intrinsic channel properties define its level of toxicity remained unclear. We report here the functional characterization of neurotoxic mutations inC. elegansDEG/ENaC channel UNC-8. Neurotoxic mutations in UNC-8 are unique in that they cause the death of only a fraction of the neurons in which UNC-8 is expressed (Shreffler et al., 1995) (Fig. 1 E). Indeed, DA/DB motor neurons swell during the L1 larval stage, but most (?65%) recover and survive into adulthood. This result suggests that the neurotoxicity of the UNC-8 mutants is lower than that of other DEG/ENaC channels including MEC-4(d), DEG-1(d), and ASIC1a (Driscoll and Chalfie, 1991;Huang and Chalfie, 1994;Xiong et al., 2004), and that it may be regulated in a cell-specific manner. We found that UNC-8 subunits form homomeric channels inXenopusoocytes and that neurotoxic mutations G387E and A586T cause channel hyperactivation. However, ionic currents are small because of the block exerted by extracellular divalent cations calcium and magnesium. Indeed, with a Ki for calcium of less than 10 uM, the UNC-8(d) channels G387E and A586T are blocked at physiological calcium concentrations, at least at negative potentials. Perhaps this effect contributes to the relatively low toxicity of UNC-8(d) channels in vivo. On the other hand, the neuronal swelling of UNC-8(d) mutants also suggests that endogenous factors and/or other subunits may at least partially relieve the calcium block of UNC-8(d) in vivo. When calcium and magnesium are removed, UNC-8(d)-dependent currents inXenopusoocytes are significantly enhanced, and this effect is correlated with oocyte toxicity. Thus, our data support the idea that the current amplitude through neurotoxic DEG/ENaC channels specifies the level of toxicity. Interestingly, UNC-8 gain-of-function mutants are calcium impermeable, suggesting that excess Na+influx is sufficient to induce the toxic insult. Elevated Na+influx could induce reversal of the Na+/Ca2+exchanger and/or membrane depolarization, resulting in activation of voltage-gated calcium channels. Both of these events are expected to elevate intracellular Ca2+. Importantly, block by extracellular divalent cations was observed in both UNC-8(G387E) and UNC-8(A586T) mutants, suggesting that the high sensitivity to extracellular divalent cations is a property of UNC-8 channels and that it is not introduced by either mutation per se. Our data show that calcium acts as an open channel blocker but does not permeate through UNC-8 gain-of-function mutant channels. In contrast, calcium acts as a permeant blocker on MEC-4(d) (Bianchi et al., 2004;Brown et al., 2008). Interestingly, although the Ki for calcium block in UNC-8(G387E) is in the micromolar range (6 uM at -100 mV), it is in the millimolar range for the MEC-4(d)-MEC-10(d) channel complex (Brown et al., 2008). Moreover, although calcium binds very close to the external mouth of the pore in UNC-8(G387E), it binds to a site deeper in the pore in the MEC-4(d)-MEC-10(d) channel complex (Brown et al., 2008). Other members of the DEG/ENaC family were shown either to be blocked by calcium or to be calcium permeable. For example, calcium-impermeable ASIC3 is blocked by calcium in the nanomolar range, and low pH releases the calcium block (Immke and McCleskey, 2003). Conversely, calcium-permeable ASIC1a is blocked by extracellular calcium with a Ki of ?5 mM (Paukert et al., 2004). Based on these observations, we speculate that DEG/ENaC channels that have a strong affinity for calcium may not be calcium permeable and vice versa. This prediction is consistent with the fact that tightly bound ions are unlikely to leave a high affinity site to permeate through the channel pore. Importantly, our data show that despite a strong affinity for calcium and magnesium, caused by the voltage dependence of the block, currents through gain-of-function UNC-8 mutants are still substantial at depolarized potentials. Based on the fact that two different UNC-8 gain-of-function mutations show strong affinity for extracellular divalent cations, we suggest that divalent cation sensitivity is likely a property intrinsic of the UNC-8 channel. Thus, we speculate that wild-type UNC-8 is similarly blocked by extracellular divalent cations. If this is the case, currents through UNC-8 may be regulated by voltage in an indirect way. For example, membrane depolarization associated with neuronal and/or synaptic activity would release calcium and magnesium block, allowing flow of ions through UNC-8. This mechanism could contribute to the recently discovered role for UNC-8 in an activity-dependent mechanism of synaptic remodeling (Petersen et al., 2011;Thompson-Peer et al., 2012; unpublished data). The two gain-of function UNC-8 mutations that hyperactivate channel function and induce neuronal swelling reside in the UNC-8 extracellular domain. G387E is located in a poorly conserved loop in the "finger" domain, and A586T is positioned in a loop between alpha 4 and alpha 5 of the "thumb" domain (Jasti et al., 2007;Gessmann et al., 2010;Eastwood and Goodman, 2012) (Fig. S2 C). Previous studies have shown that the thumb domain participates significantly in proton binding (Immke and McCleskey, 2003;Paukert et al., 2004;Jasti et al., 2007;Wang and Bianchi, 2009;Yang et al., 2009), and that it undergoes substantial movement during gating (Passero et al., 2009). In ASICs, the movement of the thumb domain is translated into channel gating by the pi-pi interaction between a conserved extracellular tyrosine adjacent to TM1 (Y72 in ASIC1a) and a tryptophan located in a loop between beta sheets 9 and 10 (W288 in ASIC1a) (Li et al., 2009). These gating residues are conserved in UNC-8 (Fig. S2 A). Our data are consistent with the idea that in UNC-8 channels, mutations that may perturb the movement of the thumb domain shift the channel into a hyperactivated mode, thereby stabilizing the channel open state, as suggested by previous studies (Hong et al., 2000;Yang et al., 2009). Thus, our data and previous published work support the idea that the thumb domain plays an important role in DEG/ENaC channel gating by diverse stimuli including mechanical forces. Intriguingly, severalmec-4mutations that result in touch insensitivity cluster around this extracellular region (Tavernarakis et al., 1997;Garcia-Anoveros et al., 1998;Hong et al., 2000). To conclude, we have characterized the functional properties of the neurotoxic UNC-8 DEG/ENaC protein. Our findings are consistent with the proposal that strong blockage exerted by extracellular divalent cations inhibits UNC-8 channel activity in vivo and that this effect limits the toxicity of UNC-8(d) channels in vivo. We suggest that the extent of divalent cation blockage, in addition to calcium permeability, is a DEG/ENaC channel property that sets the level of toxicity in vivo.
