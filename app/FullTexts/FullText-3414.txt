A 10-year-old girl with well-controlled type 1 diabetes managed with insulin pump therapy developed recurrent hypoglycemia 60 to 90 min after commencing commercial air travel. Upon direct inquiry, we are now aware of 50 children and adults using insulin pumps who experience this phenomenon. In 1994, Aanderud et al. (1) demonstrated that insulin pumps delivered "more insulin than the set rate during decompression." At sea level, the ambient pressure is 760 mmHg (1 atmosphere). When commercial planes ascend to 40,000 feet, the cabin pressure decreases by 200 mmHg to 560 mmHg (cabin pressure equivalent of 8,000 feet) (2). The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of pressure changes during airplane flight on insulin pump delivery. Five Animas 2020 pumps (IR1200/2020) and five Medtronic Paradigm pumps (1.8 mL cartridge) with 60-cm infusion systems were loaded with aspart insulin at sea level. Basal rates were 1 unit/h, and infusion sets were fixed in a 100 muL/10 cm microtubule. The canula is open to ambient pressure. The validity of this model is discussed in theSupplementary Data. Insulin pumps were placed in a hypobaric chamber at 25 degrees C. Pressure was changed to mimic normal flight in a commercial airliner (depressurization over 20 min) and an abnormal flight with catastrophic decompression. Insulin delivery from 10 pumps was studied during the flight of a commercial Boeing 767-338. Results were compared with predictions using Henry law of gas solubility (3). Twenty syringes were filled with insulin or distilled water (control) and observed for bubble formation as ambient pressure was decreased. Bubbles were then placed in the microtubules and measured with changes in pressure in a hypobaric chamber. The changes were compared with predictions from Boyle law (4). The pressure required to move the cartridge plunger in 5 Animas 2020 pumps was measured. All variables were normally distributed. Statistical significance was determined by using two-tailed Studentttests. Animas pumps delivered 0.776 units of excess insulin (SD 0.146 [range 0.645-1.04],P less than 0.000001) and Medtronic pumps delivered 0.709 units excess insulin (0.186 [0.337-0.985],P less than 0.000001). Animas pumps delivered 0.663 units less than expected (SD 0.201 [range 0.37-0.94],P less than 0.000001) and Medtronic pumps delivered 0.533 units less than expected (0.164 [0.29-0.82],P less than 0.000001). All the pumps delivered insulin due to plunger movement ( greater than 8 units delivered). During ascent (ambient pressure decrease), Animas pumps delivered 1.37 (SD 0.09) units excess insulin (0.685% of cartridge volume;P less than 0.001) and the Medtronic pumps delivered 1.01 (0.14) units excess insulin (0.561% of cartridge volume;P less than 0.001). During descent (ambient pressure increased), insulin was sucked back into the pump, causing a deficit of 0.87 (SD 0.21) units (P less than 0.01) for Animas pumps and 0.58 (0.13) units (P less than 0.01) for Medtronic pumps. In all studies, the insulin excess or deficit seen was consistent with predictions of bubble volume due to pressure changes using Henry law (Fig. 1). There was no statistical difference between Animas and Medtronic when abnormal delivery was considered as a percentage of insulin volume. Henry law (3) was used to calculate the predicted volume of nitrogen and oxygen that comes out of solution from 1.8 (dotted line), 2 (solid line), and 3 mL (dashed line) of water when ambient pressure decreases from 760 to 560 mmHg at 25 degrees C. In a pump cartridge, this gas would displace the insulin in the cartridge causing insulin delivery (1 unit = 10 muL). A linear relationship exists between the ambient pressure and the amount of gas that comes out of solution. Larger fluid volumes cause larger volumes of insulin to be delivered. Gas bubbles appeared in all the syringes when the pressure decreased by 50 mmHg. The bubbles disappeared when the pressure was returned to 760 mmHg. Air bubbles in the microtubules changed in size when pressure changed, consistent with Boyle law (4) (Supplementary Fig. A1). The Animas cartridge plunger moved when the pressure was decreased by 273.48 mmHg (SD 25.39 [range 228-303.8]), equivalent to atmospheric pressure of 486.52 mmHg. We demonstrated that decreases in ambient pressure cause predictable unintended insulin delivery by two independent mechanisms. The first mechanism is due to air coming out of solution and forming bubbles when pressure decreases. Air dissolves in water proportional to ambient pressure (3). As airplanes ascend, ambient pressure decreases and air comes out of solution, forming bubbles. The bubbles displace insulin in a pump, causing excess delivery. The larger the volume of insulin, the more bubbles will form, displacing insulin. As the airplane descends, air pressure increases again and the bubbles redissolve, which stops insulin delivery until the deficit is "replaced." If air bubbles are removed before descent, then the pump will deliver normally because water is not compressible. The second mechanism of unintended insulin delivery is due to expansion of existing bubbles in the cartridge before takeoff. These bubbles will increase in size by 36%, displacing insulin during ascent (4). Excess insulin delivered during ascent in an airplane may cause hypoglycemia 1-2 h later. Hyperglycemia may follow due to decreased insulin delivery during descent. Whether abnormalities in insulin delivery during flight cause clinical effects depend on factors such as insulin sensitivity, current glycemic control, food intake, and pump settings, among others. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires that insulin pump mechanical function is not affected by "changes in ambient pressure which would reasonably be expected to be encountered according to the intended use of the device" (5). Built-in features of insulin pumps designed to prevent plunger movement are discussed in theSupplementary Data. We demonstrated that changes in ambient pressure during commercial flights did not affect insulin pump mechanical function. Plungers may potentially move, however, causing insulin overdose with massive, rapid depressurization that occurs 40-50 times worldwide per year (6). We recommend for flights:NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneThe cartridge should only contain 1.5 mL of insulin. Disconnect the pump before takeoff. At cruising altitude, take the cartridge out of the pump and remove any air bubbles before reconnecting. After the airplane lands, disconnect the pump and prime the line with 2 units. Then reconnect the pump. During flight emergencies involving cabin decompression, disconnect the insulin pump. Insulin pumps deliver excess insulin as ambient pressure decreases, which may cause hypoglycemia. We observed three mechanisms to explain this phenomenon.
