Plaque calcification is a biomarker of early atherosclerosis [1] and correlates with complication, severity and plaque stability [2,3]. Whereas arterial calcification in aging, diabetes mellitus and end-stage renal disease is primarily confined to the medial layer, calcification in atherosclerosis occurs in the intimal plaque. Both intima and media calcification appear to be mediated by ectopic cartilage and bone formation, a consequence of the now well-documented transdifferentiation potential of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) [4,5] and also of osteochondral differentiation by other cells in the artery, including adventitial myofibroblasts [6], stem cells and pericytes [7-9] . The differentiation to 'bone-forming' chondrocyte- or osteoblast-like cells is accompanied by the expression of tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase, increased fibrillar collagen type I expression [10] and certain matrix proteins,e.g. osteopontin (OPN), osteocalcin (OC), collagen type II and type X [11-13]. Recent studies in human beings and animal models have demonstrated that (as in mineralizing bone) arterial calcification is inhibited by physiological function of resident cells (including SMCs and endothelial cells) [14,15]. Specifically, it was shown that SMCs normally express inhibitors of mineralization, such as inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) and matrix gla protein (Mgp), respectively, and that lack of these molecules leads to spontaneous vascular calcification and increased mortality [16,17]. One of these inhibitors is the nucleotide pyrophosphatase/ phosphodiesterase (NPP) family member NPP1, because severe inborn deficiency of NPP1 is associated with calcification of arteries in mice and human beings [18,19]. NPP1 is a major generator of extracellular PPiin cartilage and a variety of other tissues, including heart, kidney, liver, pancreas and skeletal muscle [20]. PPipotently inhibits hydroxyapatite crystal deposition and growth and regulates chondrogenesis, collagen I expression and synthesis [21] and other cell differentiation processes [22]. These include promotion of the expression of OPN by PPi[19,23], which in turn promotes atherogenesisviarecruitment of monocyte macrophages, and also inhibits arterial calcification by effects that include suppression of hydroxyapatite crystal growth [24]. The physiological role of NPP1-mediated PPigeneration in tissue calcification has come to light recently. In human beings, inactivating homozygous or inactivating compound heterozygous mutations ofENPP1are associated with generalized arterial calcification of infancy (GACI), a frequently lethal form of disseminated arterial media calcification and myointimal proliferation [25]. InEnpp1knockout mice, hydroxyapatite crystals are found in the aortic medial layer at the level of the internal elastic lamina [18]. These mice additionally develop abnormal calcification of periarticular tissues [23]. A similar phenotype was found in thettw/ttwmouse, harbouring a homozygous truncation mutation in theEnpp1gene [26,27]. The role of NPP1 in atherogenesis and intimal calcification is unknown. Previous studies have shown that the lack of Npp1 leads to decreased expression of Opn in osteoclasts [23]. Opn is a known chemoattractant for macrophages, the most prominent cell type in atherosclerotic lesions [28]. Additionally, we have shown that NPP1 expression is down-regulated in calcified plaques compared to uncalcified atherosclerotic lesions in human carotid endarterectomy samples [29]. We suggested that atherosclerotic lesion progression is attenuated and calcification in the atherosclerotic plaque is enhanced due to a total or partial deficiency of Npp1. To test our hypotheses, we crossed Npp1-deficientttw/ttwmice with ApoE-deficient mice to generate Npp1 and ApoE double deficient mice. ApoE is a structural component of all lipoprotein particles except low-density lipoprotein (LDL). It serves as a high-affinity ligand for lipoprotein receptors and thus allows the uptake of ApoE-containing particles by the liver [30]. Mice deficient in ApoE show increased serum cholesterol and triglycerides leading to atherosclerotic plaque development [31]. Our studies revealed that on theApoEknockout background, both partial and severe Npp1 deficiency (heterozygous and homozygousttwphenotype) slow down atherosclerotic lesion progression. Furthermore, we found that partial Npp1 deficiency was associated with a tendency towards greater intimal plaque calcification. Thus, our results suggest that in the atherosclerotic plaque NPP1 suppresses calcification but promotes atherogenesis. The creation of the Npp1-deficientttw/ttwmouse [a breeding colony of attwmice stock with ICR (Institute of Cancer Research) background in the Central Institute for Experimental Animals (Kanagawa, Japan)] used in this study has been described previously [27]. In this study, heterozygous mice are designated asttw/+,Enpp1wild-type aswt. C57BL/6ApoE-/-mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbour, ME, USA) were bred tottw/+ mice. Homozygous double-knockoutttw/ttw ApoE-/-mice were generated by brother-sister mating ofttw/+ ApoE-/-mice on a ICR/C57BL/6 background (1:1). Enpp1wt,Enpp1heterozygous andEnpp1null mice amongApoEnull mice were designated aswt ApoE-/-,ttw/+ ApoE-/-andttw/ttw ApoE-/-, respectively. Enpp1andApoEgenotyping was performed by the polymerase chain reaction analysis of tail DNA as described elsewhere ([27]; JAX(r) Mice database). The study was approved by the local committee for animal studies (Reg. No. : G21/2004). The pups were weaned at three weeks of age and then maintained on normal chow diet. At eight weeks of age male littermates (18ttw/ttw ApoE-/-, 18ttw/+ApoE-/-and 21wt ApoE-/-) were set on high-fat/high-cholesterol diet with 16% coconut oil, 1% cholesterol and 0.5% sodium cholate for 5, 10, 15 or 20 weeks. Mice were killed at 13, 18, 23 or 28 weeks of age. Blood samples (0.5-0.8 ml) were obtained by retro-orbital bleed to assess lipid profiles. The arterial tree was fixed by perfusion through the left ventricle at physiological pressure using warmed (37 degrees C) 0.9% NaCl for 4 min. followed by 4% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde (pH 7.5) for 6 min. The aortic arch, including its main branchpoints (brachiocephalic trunk, left common carotid artery and left subclavian artery) were removed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. All vessels were processed and embedded longitudinally in paraffin. The entire aortic arch was then cut into approximately 30 sections, and a series of 15 sections of 4 mum thickness, which represented the central area of the aortic arch with an intact morphology of the complete arch, was used for analysis. Whole blood obtained was centrifugated (5000 rpm, 5 min.) for separating serum and stored at -20 degrees C. Total serum cholesterol and serum triglyceride levels were determined in duplicate using commercially available enzymatic colorimetric assays (cholesterol CHOD-PAP and triglycerides GPO-PAP; ProDiagnostica, Freiburg, Germany). For histological analysis, four sections (16 mum apart), stained with Elastica von Giesson were used for the morphometrical analysis. Elastica von Giesson staining, which stains the elastic laminae, was used to delineate the internal elastic lamina, to permit an easier distinction between media and intima. The aortic arch region was defined as the aortic root to approximately 1.5 mm caudal from the left subclavian artery branchpoint. Main branchpoints were also included into the measurements: the brachiocephalic trunk, left common carotid artery and left subclavian artery. Plaque area, excluding the underlying media, was determined for each individual plaque as the number of pixels using Adobe Photoshop CS3 extended (San Jose, CA, USA) [32]. Plaque area was converted to square micrometres. Calcified areas were detected in von Kossa stainings in the same serial sections and in the same manner used to determine total plaque area; the relative calcification content was determined by dividing calcified area by plaque area. Opn- and macrophages (MPhi)- containing areas were detected by immunohistochemistry and determined in the same manner in which relative calcification content was estimated. Haematoxylin and eosin standard stain demonstrated general morphology. A goat antimouse antibody reacting against OPN, was used in this study (R D Systems GmbH, Wiesbaden-Nordenstadt, Germany). A monoclonal antibody, reacting against monocytes and macrophages (clone MOMA-2) was purchased from Serotec, Tokyo, Japan. The sections were stained with OPN and MOMA-2 (1:50) followed by biotin-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG followed by Streptavidin-biotin peroxidase complex (ABC Vectastain Elite Kit; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) and counterstained with nuclear fast red or haematoxylin and eosin. To isolate primary SMCs, the aorta of 6-week-oldwt ApoE-/-,ttw/+ ApoE-/-andttw/ttw ApoE-/-mice was explanted, and cultured in Dulbecco's minimal Eagle medium (DMEM) containing 2% L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 50 mug/ml streptomycin and 20% foetal calf serum (FCS) Gold (Lonza, Verviers, Belgium). The sprouted SMC were passaged and cultured in DMEM containing 10% FCS Gold. Only cultures containing more than 90% SMC specific alpha-actin (using a monoclonal antibody HHF35, 1:500; Dako Corporation, Carpenteria, CA, USA) and SM22alpha (using a monoclonal antibody 1B8, 1:250; Abcam plc, Cambridge, UK) positive stained cells in passage 3 were used for total RNA isolation. Total RNA of SMC was isolated using RNeasy(r) Mini Kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany). One microgram of total RNA was reverse-transcribed after an initial denaturation step at 65 degrees C for 10 min. in a total volume of 20 mul using 10 U/mul of SuperscriptTM III reverse transcriptase (InvitrogenTM Life Technologies, Paisley, UK), 1 U/mul Ribo LockTM ribonuclease inhibitor (MBI Fermentas GmbH, St. Leon-Rot, Germany), 25 ng/mul oligo[(dT)12-18] (InvitrogenTM Life Technologies), 0.5 mmol/l each of 2'-desoxynucleoside-5'triphosphate (dNTP), 5 mmol/l dithiothreitol, 1* first strand buffer [250 mmol/l Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 375 mmol/l KCl, 15 mmol/l MgCl2] freshly diluted from 5* stock (InvitrogenTM Life Technologies) at 37 degrees C for 60 min. Samples were heated at 95 degrees C for 5 min. to terminate reverse transcriptase activity. Total reverse transcription (RT) products were subsequently used for PCR amplification. mRNAs of SMC specificSm22alpha,Mgp,Opn,Ocand the housekeeping geneGapdhwere assessed in aortic SMC. The RT products (100 ng) were brought to a volume of 25 mul containing 1* Qiagen GmbH PCR buffer, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM of each dNTP, 1.5 U of Taq Polymerase (Qiagen GmbH) and 0.4 muM of each primer. Primers were designed across intron/exon boundaries. Table S1 summarizes the individual sequences of the primers, annealing temperatures and cycle numbers used for each primer pair and the PCR product sizes. After denaturation at 95 degrees C for 5 min. amplification was carried out in an Eppendorf Mastercycler(r) Gradient (Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, Germany) using the following temperature and time profile: denaturation at 95 degrees C for 30 sec. ; primer annealing at the respective temperatures for 60 sec. ; primer extension at 72 degrees C for 60 sec. and a final extension of 72 degrees C for 10 min. 10 mul of the PCR reaction were analysed using standard agarose gel electrophoresis. To evaluate the relative expression, the agarose gels were scanned using a video documentation system and analysed using ImageJ software (version 1.40g; ImageJ, imagej.nih.gov/ij/). The absorption units were corrected forGapdhmRNA levels. Statistical analysis for comparison of multiple groups used one-wayanovafollowed by the Tukey'spost hoctest, performed with GraphPad Prism software (version 4.0, GraphPad software; San Diego, CA, USA). Results were expressed as mean +/- S.E.M. Probability values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Feeding a high-fat/high-cholesterol diet towt ApoE-/-,ttw/+ ApoE-/-andttw/ttw ApoE-/-mice caused hyperlipidemia reflected by elevated serum cholesterol and triglycerides compared to mice with normal chow diet (Table 1). There was no significant difference between genotypes. Body weight measurement revealed no difference betweenwt ApoE-/-andttw/+ ApoE-/-mice, but weights of these genotypes were significantly higher than inttw/ttw ApoE-/-mice. High-fat/high-cholesterol diet had no effect on body weight of all three genotypes compared to mice fed with normal chow diet (Table 1).

Opn was mainly present in areas of the plaque containing macrophages (Fig. 2). These areas were also the major sites of Enpp1 expression in the plaque (data not shown). After 28 weeks, the relative Opn content in atherosclerotic lesions was significant decreased inttw/ttw ApoE-/-mice compared towt ApoE-/-mice (23.7%+/- 11.6%versus47.0%+/- 9.9%,P less than 0.05,Figs 2A, Eand S1). The relative Opn-containing area was lower by trend inttw/+ ApoE-/-mice compared withwt ApoE-/-mice (34.7%+/- 11.1% forttw/+ ApoE-/-versus47.0%+/- 9.9% forwt ApoE-/-mice,P less than 0.1;Figs 2A, C, Eand S1).

The macrophages-containing area expressed as percentage of total lesion area was smaller by trend inttw/ttw ApoE-/-mice compared withttw/+ ApoE-/-andwt ApoE-/-mice (22.2%+/- 14.2% forttw/+ ApoE-/-versus35.7%+/- 10.3% forttw/+ ApoE-/-and 43.7%+/- 14.9% forwt ApoE-/-mice,P less than 0.1;Figs 2B, D, Fand S1). Mice of the three genotypes were analysed at 13, 18, 23 or 28 weeks of age. At the age of 13 weeks, 60% ofttw/ttw ApoE-/-, 80% ofttw/+ ApoE-/-and 100% ofwt ApoE-/-mice developed atherosclerotic plaques in the aortic arch (Table 2). One hundred percent of older mice of all genotypes showed plaque development. The atherosclerotic lesion area in the aortic arch was carefully determined on 57 mice. Individual data points plotted by genotype and age are presented inFigure 4. There were no significant differences in the mean lesion area in the aortic arch between groups at 13, 18 and 23 weeks of age (Figs 3A-C, 4A-CandTable 2). However, in 28-week-old mice,ttw/+ ApoE-/-andttw/ttw ApoE-/-mice had significantly smaller atherosclerotic lesions compared withwt ApoE-/-mice (*P less than 0.05 forttw/ttw ApoE-/-versus wt ApoE-/-, **P less than 0.01 forttw/+ ApoE-/-versus wt ApoE-/-;Figs 3D-F, 4DandTable 2). This finding was consistent when normalizing the lesion areas to the respective body weights of the animals (Fig. S2).

Von Kossa staining for calcifications (brown, arrows) of atherosclerostic lesions (D-F) and the aortic wall (G-I). von Kossa staining demonstrated aortic media calcifications in 60% of 13-week-old, 80% of 18-week-old and 100% of olderttw/ttw ApoE-/-mice, whereasttw/+ ApoE-/-andwt ApoE-/-mice were totally devoid of medial calcification (Fig. 3G-IandTable 3). At the age of 28 weeks, plaque calcification developed in all genotypes, in 60% ofwt ApoE-/-and 75% ofttw/+ ApoE-/-andttw/ttw ApoE-/-mice (Fig. 3D-F). There was a non-significant increase in mean size of calcified areas in the intimal layer ofttw/ttw ApoE-/-andttw/+ ApoE-/-compared withwt ApoE-/-mice (1332 mum2+/- 763.2 forttw/ttw ApoE-/-and 1286 mum2+/- 621.1 forttw/+ ApoE-/-versus598 mum2+/- 290.7 forwt ApoE-/-mice,P= 0.36 andP= 0.32;Fig. 5CandTable 3).

Our study was consistent with prior findings of media calcifications in the aorta of severely Npp1-deficient mice in the absence of atherosclerosis [18,26] (and own unpublished results). Interestingly, we did not observe any medial calcification inttw/+ mice with atherosclerosis, suggesting that one functional copy ofEnpp1transcript is sufficient to suppress media calcification. Instead, advanced plaques of 28-week-oldttw/+ ApoE-/-mice showed a tendency of an increase in the calcified to total lesion area ratio compared towt ApoE-/-mice, suggesting that function- or expression-impairing mutations on one allele ofENPP1may lead to increased calcified areas in late stages of atherogenesis. However this result was not statistically significant, which may be due to limited power of our study. Our results suggest that expression of NPP1 in the arterial wall is necessary to suppress intimal plaque calcification. This finding is in line with our previous study showing that NPP1 expression is down-regulated in calcified plaques compared to uncalcified atherosclerotic lesions in human carotid endarterectomy samples [29]. Interestingly, several studies on the K173Q genotype ofENPP1in adults associated this with coronary calcification, aortic stiffness, myocardial infarction and earlier onset of peripheral arterial disease [33,34]. Accordingly, we previously demonstrated a small decrease in enzymatic activity of the K173Q variant of NPP1in vitro[16]; however, levels of enzymatic NPP1 activity in patients carrying this variant on one allele have not been studied yet. In our study we show that, although one copy ofENPP1is sufficient to suppress media calcification, it is not sufficient to suppress intima calcification in the context of atherosclerosis in mice. We would therefore speculate that those patients carrying the K173Q polymorphism ofENPP1have an increased risk of intima calcification instead of media calcification. Conversely these patients might have a decreased atherosclerotic lesion burden compared to the general population. In the current study, we show that in ApoE-deficient mice with total absence as well as with the partial loss of Npp1Opnexpression is reduced, leading to reduced Opn-containing areas in atherosclerotic lesions. Previous studies showed decreasedOpnlevels inEnpp1-/-mice osteoblast and arterial SMC [18,23,35]. Studies on different proteins involved in PPimetabolism,e.g. NPP1, the multiple-pass transmembrane protein ANK and the tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase, determined that OPN expression is directly regulated by extracellular PPilevels [23,36]. That reduced OPN levels correlate with reduced plaque size has been shown previously. Matsuiet al. described 30-40% smaller atherosclerotic lesion areas in 36-week-old female Opn-deficient atherosclerotic (Opn/ApoEnull) mice compared withApoEnull mice, due to less macrophages and lymphocytes in the lesion [37]. Also, in female 34-week-oldOpn/ ApoE/ LDL receptortriple knockout mice, atherosclerotic lesion area is reduced compared withApoE/ LDL receptordeficient mice [38]. Furthermore, it has been shown that transgenic mice that overexpress Opn are more prone to develop fatty streaks than wild-type mice [39]. We also found that the infiltration of macrophages in atherosclerotic lesions in Npp1-/ApoE-deficient mice was less extensive compared with ApoE-deficient mice by trend. These results are consistent with previous findings that OPN is a chemoattractant for macrophages [28]. We speculate that decreased Opn expression associated with Npp1 deficiency is a likely mediator of decreased atherogenesis in our mouse model. Taken together, our study revealed that absolute NPP1 deficiency caused by a homozygous null mutation as well as partial deficiency caused by heterozygosity in theENPP1locus promote intimal plaque calcification and attenuate atherosclerotic lesion progression. Thus, although mutations on bothENPP1alleles lead to GACI, mutations on one allele might be protective against atherosclerosis. Decreased OPN expression associated with NPP1 deficiency is a likely mediator of decreased atherogenesis but also likely promotes atherosclerotic plaque calcification. Our study was limited by the short lifespan of Npp1-deficient mice, which is caused by the severity of the skeletal phenotype resulting in a feeding disorder. We had to accelerate atherosclerotic lesion development in Npp1 and ApoE double deficient mice by feeding a cholesterol-rich diet, because Npp1-deficient mice usually survive no longer than 30 weeks. For the atherosclerotic ApoE-deficient mice on chow diet, Rattazziet al. described small areas of plaque calcification apparent between 45 and 60 weeks of age at the earliest [40]. In our study, because the atherogenesis was accelerated by a high-fat/high-cholesterol diet, we were not able to investigate effects of Npp1 deficiency on 'natural' plaque development inApoEnull mice. Based on the results of our current study and previous work [29], we propose a novel model for modulation of NPP1 expression and the role of NPP1 in promotion of atherogenesis and suppression of intimal plaque calcification (Fig. 6). NPP1 generates PPiand thereby promotes OPN expression [23,36], which is a known chemoattractant for monocyte macrophages [28]. It is known, that NPP1 is up-regulated by transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta[41] and down-regulated by interleukin (IL)-1beta[42]. During atherosclerotic lesion progression, the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1beta is increased [43,44], whereas TGF-beta responsiveness is suppressed [45]. We speculate that this shift within lesions associated with decreased TGF-beta responsiveness and increased inflammation including IL-1beta expression could account for the drop in NPP1 expression in atherosclerotic lesions. This effect, linked with decreased PPigeneration and inhibition of OPN expression has the capacity to promote calcification. It will be of interest to test this paradigm more directly in furtherin vivostudies. Model for modulation of NPP1 expression and role of NPP1 in atherogenesis and suppression of intimal plaque calcification based on results of promotion of atherosclerotic lesion development but suppression of intimal plaque calcification. This model is based on the results of a previous study that showed regulated expression of NPP1 and OPN in human atherosclerotic lesions [29], and is based on the results of the current study inApoEknockout mice with partial and severe deficiency of Npp1 inttw/+ andttw/ttwmice. NPP1 generates PPiand thereby promotes OPN expression that promotes progression of atherogenesis. However, a shift within lesions to decreased TGF-beta responsiveness [45] and increased inflammation including IL-1beta expression [43,44] could account for the previously described drop NPP1 expression in atherosclerotic lesion cells including SMCs. This effect, linked with decreased PPigeneration and inhibition of OPN expression, promotes plaque calcification. We observe increased atherosclerotic plaque calcification in Npp1-/ApoE-deficient lesionsin vivoin this study.
