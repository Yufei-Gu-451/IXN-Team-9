Leishmaniaare protozoan parasites (order Trypanosomatida, class Kinetoplastida) that cause a range of diseases and present a serious health risk to millions of people worldwide (Desjeux, 2004 ? ; Reithingeret al. , 2007 ? ). The incidence of infection is primarily in tropical and subtropical regions of the world (Herwaldt, 1999 ? ). The different species ofLeishmaniaare responsible for distinctive conditions (Reithingeret al. , 2007 ? ). For example,L. donovanicauses visceral leishmaniasis, a potentially fatal disease, while infection withL. majorleads to cutaneous leishmaniasis. Several com-pounds are available to treat these infections, but increasing levels of drug resistance combined with the high cost and toxicity of anti-leishmanial drugs compromises the control of the diseases (Croftet al. , 2006 ? ; Maltezou, 2010 ? ). These observations explain in part why the World Health Organization has identified the leishmaniases as neglected diseases and is urgently seeking novel therapeutic approaches (World Health Organization, 2007 ? ). Our aim is to identify and characterize drug targets in these parasites and to apply structure-based approaches to develop potent inhibitors that possess the right chemical properties to underpin early-stage drug discovery (Hunter, 2009 ? ). A promising target with respect to infection withLeishmaniasp. is the NADPH-dependent short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase pteridine reductase (PTR1; EC 1.5.1.33). This enzyme is unique to trypanosomatid parasites, where it supports the provision of reduced biopterins that are necessary for meta-cyclogenesis (Cunninghamet al. , 2001 ?) and which are implicated in resistance to reactive oxygen and nitrogen species inLeishmania(Moreiraet al. , 2009 ? ). PTR1 catalyzes the reduction of biopterin to 7,8-dihydrobiopterin as well as its subsequent reduction to 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin. Additionally, the enzyme catalyzes similar reactions in the salvage of unconjugated folates inLeishmania(Nare, Hardyet al. , 1997 ? ; Nare, Luba et al., 1997 ? ). AsLeishmaniaare auxotrophic for pteridines (folates and pterins) and are required to obtain these nutrients from their environment to maintain growth, disrupting this salvage process represents a potential therapeutic strategy. We have previously studied the structure-mechanism-activity relationships for the enzymes fromL. major(LmPTR1) andTryp-ano-soma brucei(TbPTR1) and determined the structures of a series of inhibitor complexes (Gourleyet al. , 2001 ? ; Dawsonet al. , 2006 ? ; Cavazzutiet al. , 2008 ? ; Mpamhangaet al. , 2009 ? ), whilst the structure ofT. cruziPTR2 has been reported by others (Schormannet al. , 2005 ? ). We identified sequence and structural differences betweenLmPTR1 andTbPTR1 that explain why some inhibitors display a significant level of selectivity for one orthologue over the other (Gibsonet al. , 2009 ? ; Tullochet al. , 2010 ? ). Although we were able to routinely generate crystals ofTbPTR1 that diffracted to between 2.0 and 1.0 A resolution (Dawsonet al. , 2010 ? ), studies withLmPTR1 have been hampered by poor crystal quality and a lack of reproducibility. One crystal form ofLmPTR1 diffracted to beyond 2.0 A resolution but could only be obtained in the presence of NADPH and methotrexate (Gourleyet al. , 2001 ? ); when other ligands were present different crystal forms were obtained. The size of the asymmetric unit is increased from two to either four or eight subunits and the crystals are often mechanically twinned and diffract to lower resolution, with the diffraction pattern being anisotropic and highly mosaic (McLuskeyet al. , 2004 ? ; Schuttelkopfet al. , 2005 ? ). An alternative source ofLeishmaniaPTR1 was therefore sought for our investigations. Studies withL. tarentolaePTR1 resulted in a 2.8 A resolution structure of the complex with NADPH, but despite its presence in the crystallization mixture the tight-binding ligand methotrexate was not observed in the electron-density maps (Zhaoet al. , 2003 ? ). This was not considered to be an improvement on the results that we had previously obtained, so we elected to initiate crystallographic studies ofL. donovaniPTR1 (LdPTR1), this also being the enzyme from the pathogen that causes the most serious form of leishmaniasis. There is a high level of conservation (91% sequence identity) between theL. majorandL. donovanienzymes and homology modelling of the latter has suggested a close structural relationship in and around the active site (Kauret al. , 2010 ? ). The gene encodingLdPTR1 was cloned into the expression vector pET15b (Novagen) modified to encode a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease-cleavable N-terminal hexahistidine tag. This plasmid was heat-shock transformed intoEscherichia coliBL21 (DE3) GOLD cells (Stratagene) and selected on Luria-Bertani (LB) agar plates containing 50 mg l-1carbenicillin. Cells were then cultured in LB medium containing the same antibiotic at 310 K with shaking. Gene expression was induced with isopropyl beta-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside at a final concentration of 1 mMwhen the cells reached the mid-log phase of growth (optical density at 600 nm of 0.6-0.8). After incubation at room temperature for 16 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation (4000g, 277 K, 30 min), washed with fresh medium and the centrifugation was repeated. Cell pellets were frozen at 253 K until required. For purification, the frozen cell pellet from 1 l culture was thawed on ice and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mMTris-HCl pH 7.7, 200 mMKCl, 20 mMimidazole) supplemented with an EDTA-free protease-inhibitor cocktail tablet (Roche) and 100 ug DNAse I (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were lysed using a French cell press and the lysate was clarified by centrifugation (37 000g, 277 K, 30 min). The supernatant was filtered (0.2 um) and applied onto a 5 ml HisTrap metal-chelating column (GE Healthcare) preloaded with Ni2+and equilibrated with lysis buffer. A linear imidazole gradient was applied and the protein eluted at a concentration of approximately 160 mMimidazole. Fractions containingLdPTR1 were pooled and the histidine tag was cleaved by incubation with TEV protease at 303 K for 3 h. Imidazole was removed from the buffer by dialysis and cleavage continued at 277 K overnight before a second Ni2+-affinity step was performed, isolating the pure and cleavedLdPTR1. The protein was concentrated to approximately 10 mg ml-1using a centrifugal filter unit with a molecular-weight cutoff of 3500 Da (Millipore) and the buffer was exchanged to 20 mMTris-HCl pH 7.7. The high level of purity ( greater than 95%) and the molecular weight of the protein were con-firmed by SDS-PAGE and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (data not shown). The yield of purified protein was relatively low at approximately 3 mg per litre of bacterial culture and we note that most of the material produced was insoluble. Sitting-drop vapour diffusion was used to test a range of commercially available screens. Crystals were only obtained in the presence of both cofactor and an inhibitor and these were optimized in hanging drops. A solution of 5 mg ml-1LdPTR1, 1 mMNADP+, 20 mMdithiothreitol and 1 mMmethotrexate was incubated on ice for 1 h before crystallization. The protein solution (1 ul) was mixed with reservoir solution (1 ul) and stored at room temperature. Small orthorhombic plates with approximate dimensions of 0.1 * 0.1 * less than 0.05 mm formed within days above reservoirs containing 0.1 MMES pH 6.5, 10%(v/v) dioxane and 1.6 Mammonium sulfate (Fig. 1 ? ). Crystals were placed in a nylon loop and flash-cooled to 100 K in a stream of nitrogen gas after first being cryoprotected by passing them through a solution of 40% PEG 400. Initial in-house X-ray experiments using a Rigaku MicroMax-007 rotating-anode X-ray generator and an R-AXIS IV++image-plate detector produced only smeared low-resolution diffraction images. The quality of the diffraction was improved by an annealing step in which the cryostream was manually diverted and reintroduced after 5-10 s (data not shown). Diffraction data were then collected on beamline I04 at the Diamond Light Source synchrotron. The data were processed and scaled usingMOSFLM(Leslie, 2006 ?) andSCALA(Evans, 2006 ? ; Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994 ? ), respectively. The space group isC2221and the unit-cell parameters area= 107.51,b= 126.44,c= 87.51 A. The Matthews coefficient (Matthews, 1968 ?) of 2.5 A3 Da-1, which corresponds to approximately 50% bulk solvent, suggested that two subunits occupy the asymmetric unit. TheLdPTR1 structure was solved by molecular replacement usingPhaser(McCoyet al. , 2007 ? ). The search model was a singleLmPTR1 subunit (PDB code1e7w; Gourleyet al. , 2001 ?) in which divergent residues were truncated to Cbetaand all ligands were removed. Two subunits were positioned and rigid-body refinement and all subsequent refinements were carried out usingREFMAC5 (Murshudovet al. , 1997 ? ). The graphics programCoot(Emsley Cowtan, 2004 ?) was used to inspect difference and electron-density maps for model fitting, solvent and ligand searching. Sulfate and water molecules were added after the protein model was completed and further rounds of refinement were performed. Noncrystallographic symmetry restraints were not employed during the analysis. Crystallographic statistics are shown in Table 1 ? . Figures were prepared withPyMOL(DeLano, 2002 ? ). PTR1 is a tetrameric enzyme and this crystal form ofLdPTR1 has two subunits (labelledAandB) in the asymmetric unit; a 21screw axis parallel tocgenerates the tetramer (Fig. 2 ? a). Each monomer is formed by a seven-stranded central beta-sheet flanked by a set of three alpha-helices on either side (Fig. 2 ? b): a Rossmann-fold repeat (Gourleyet al. , 2001 ? ). The structures of subunitsAandBare highly conserved, with an r.m.s.d. of 0.51 A when 212 Calphaatoms are matched; therefore, unless otherwise stated all descriptions refer to subunitAofLdPTR1. Sequence comparisons betweenLdPTR1 andLmPTR1 (data not shown) indicate that the residues involved in the construction of the active site and that are essential for catalysis in binding cofactor, substrates, products and inhibitors are strictly conserved and are also highly conserved inTbPTR1 (Dawsonet al. , 2006 ? ). However, the residues near the catalytic site were poorly ordered in contrast to the same regions ofLmPTR1 andTbPTR1, with no electron density corresponding to NADP+or methotrexate, ligands that were present in the crystallization conditions in a fivefold molar excess. TheKifor methotrexate inhibition ofLmPTR1 is 39 +/- 19 nMand that with respect toTbPTR1 is 152 +/- 16 nM(Dawsonet al. , 2006 ? ). Ammonium sulfate was the precipitant for crystal growth and a sulfate ion binds in a polar cavity formed by the beta1-alpha1 turn and the loop between beta2 and alpha2, accepting hydrogen bonds donated from three main-chain amides (His38, Arg39 and Ser40) and Ser40 OG (Fig. 3 ? ). This polar cavity is the binding site for the adenine 2'--phosphate group of the cofactor (Gourleyet al. , 2001 ? ; Dawsonet al. , 2006 ? ). The core structure of the subunit is preserved between theLdPTR1 andLmPTR1 structures (Fig. 4 ?) and an overlay of 202 Calphaatoms common to both subunits resulted in an r.m.s.d. of 1.3 A (calculated usingCoot; Emsley Cowtan, 2004 ? ). Owing to the absence of well defined electron density, theLdPTR1 model contains fewer residues compared with those ofLmPTR1 orTbPTR1. Missing segments include residues 70-80 (the loop linking beta3 and alpha3), 112-132 (the beta4-alpha4 loop) and 227-254 (the beta6-alpha6 loop). The beta3-alpha3 loop is also poorly ordered inLmPTR1 (Schuttelkopfet al. , 2005 ? ). However, the beta4-alpha4 loop is well ordered inLmPTR1 but is missing inLdPTR1. This means that inLdPTR1, Phe113, which is a critical residue, is disordered. The phenylalanine, together with the nicotin-amide, forms pi-stacking interactions that stabilize ligand binding in the catalytic site (Gourleyet al. , 2001 ? ; Dawsonet al. , 2006 ? ). The largest break in the electron density involves residues 227-254, which form what is termed the substrate-binding loop linking beta6 to alpha6 (Tullochet al. , 2010 ? ). Residues in this loop bind parts of folate sub-strates, products and some inhibitors. The absence of the beta4-alpha4 loop vacates an area in the active-site cleft, allowing the beta5-alpha5 loop ofLdPTR1 to adopt a different position to fill the gap. Here, the Calphaatoms of several residues relocate by between 10 and 16 A. InLdPTR1 Arg17 is disordered. This residue is important in binding the cofactor pyrophosphate (McLuskeyet al. , 2004 ? ), which in turn interacts with and positions the nicotinamide. Asp181, Tyr194 and Lys198 are the key catalytic residues. Asp181 is located within the link between beta5 and alpha5, but this loop has been built into weak electron density relative to the structure as a whole. The orientation of Tyr194 is similar to that observed inLmPTR1. However, only the Calphaatoms of Lys198 and its closest neighbours agree reasonably well with the identicalLmPTR1 residues, while the side chain extends into a position that is inappropriate to form the stabilizing interaction formed with the nicotinamide ribose inLmPTR1 (Gourleyet al. , 2001 ? ; data not shown). PTR1 displays a sequential ordered mechanism, with first cofactor binding and then substrate; following reduction the product leaves, followed by oxidized cofactor (Lubaet al. , 1998 ? ; Gourleyet al. , 2001 ? ). Substrate or inhibitors can only bind after the binary protein-cofactor complex has formed. Since sulfate binding blocks the 2'--phosphate-binding site, NADP+is not present and this leads to disorder in the substrate-binding part of the active site. The structure of apoLdPTR1 has been solved to 2.5 A resolution. Attempts to improve theLdPTR1 crystal quality by attempting to crystallize the apo form and the binary complex with cofactor and by introducing other ligands in combination with oxidized and reduced cofactor failed. Even though we see no evidence for these ligands in the electron-density maps, the presence of both methotrexate and NADP+was essential to obtain this crystal form. Despite their presence in the crystallization mixture, there was no electron density corresponding to these molecules. Instead, the high ammonium sulfate concentration in the crystallization conditions resulted in the replacement of an NADP+phosphate by sulfate ions. The formation of the catalytic site of PTR1 is dependent on the presence of nicotinamide and in the absence of NADPH(+) this part of the active site is disordered. We conclude that owing to the disorder this crystal form is not suitable for characterizing the interactions ofLdPTR1 with inhibitors. PDB reference:pteridine reductase, 2xox
