Polycyclic diamine alkaloids are characteristic of marine sponges in the order Haplosclerida. To date, over 120 such alkaloids have been reported, most isolated from four families of Haplosclerida (Callyspongiidae, Chalinidae, Niphatidae, and Petrosiidae). NoneThis class of alkaloids is proposed to be derived from ammonia, propenal, and long-chain dialdehydes as the universal building blocks. NoneDue to the structural complexity and biological activity of polycyclic diamine alkaloids, these compounds have attracted a great deal of interest from natural product chemists. NoneExtensive studies on an extract derived from the Indonesian spongeNeopetrosiacfexigua(Kirkpatrick, 1900) (order Haplosclerida, family Petrosiidae) have led to the isolation of two new alkaloids, neopetrocyclamines A and B (1and2), along with two known alkaloids, papuamine (3) and haliclonadiamine (4). None,NoneHerein, we report the structure elucidation of1and2. Neopetrocyclamine A (1) was isolated as an optically active yellow oil. The HR-ESITOFMS data for1provided a molecular ion ofm/z381.3269 [M]+. This datum defined a molecular formula of C26H41N2+, which suggested1contained 7.5 double-bond equivalents and a positive charge. Seven sp2carbons (dC-14132.4; dC-15128.8; dC-17129.6; dC-18134.0; dC-24133.5; dC-25124.3; dC-28155.0) were observed in the13C NMR spectrum (Table1), which indicated one carbon-nitrogen and three carbon-carbon double bonds were present in1. The multiplicity-edited HSQC spectrum recorded in pyridine-d5showed that the 26 carbon resonances correlated to 41 protons, which were ascribed to 11 methines and 15 methylenes. HMBC correlations observed in CDCl3. Extensive analyses of the NMR spectroscopic data (recorded in pyridine-d5) established the four units that comprised the planar structure of1(Figure1). While most of the backbone was readily deduced through this analysis, one piece of datum deserves comment. Examination of the NMR data of1revealed a 9.60 ppm proton singlet uncorrelated to any carbon signal in the HSQC spectrum (optimized for 140 Hz), yet still present in MeOH-d4, indicating1JC,Houtside of the typical range. A literature search focusing on uncommon functional groups suggested that this downfield proton singlet could be ascribed to a formyl-like sp2carbon, with a1JC,Hcoupling greater than 170 Hz. An HSQC experiment optimized for a1JC,Hof 200 Hz showed a correlation between dH9.60 and a sp2carbon at 155.0 ppm, verifying this hypothesis. Therefore, in addition to the three olefins and the delocalized double bond of the formamidinium group that accounted for four degrees of unsaturation,1contained four rings. Initial fragments of1. The fragments were assembled via analyses of the HMBC and COSY spectra. The terminal methylene (dC-655.3) of fragment B was linked to the nitrogen atom (N-5) of fragment A based on HMBC correlations from H-6 to C-4 and H-28 to C-6. In addition, the methine proton signal (dH-162.79) at the other terminus displayed COSY cross-peaks to two olefinic protons (dH-155.63 and dH-175.72) that connected fragments B and C. Fragment D was located between the C-23 methylene of fragment C and the nitrogen atom (N-1) of fragment A based on a COSY correlation from H-24 to H-23 and HMBC correlations from H-27 to C-2 and H-28 to C-27. Taken as a whole, these data defined a 17-membered macrocycle (C ring) with an exocyclic tetrahydropyrimidinium ring. Neopetrocyclamine B (2) was isolated as an optically active, colorless powder. A comparison between the HR-ESITOFMS data of1and2indicated that2(C25H42N2) was 11 amu smaller than1and contained only six double-bond equivalents. Analysis of the multiplicity-edited HSQC spectrum indicated that2possessed the same basic carbon skeleton as that of1except that2did not contain the H-28/C-28 resonances corresponding to the formamidinium cation. Taken together, the missing signals and analysis of the 2D NMR spectroscopic data (Table2) confirmed2contained the presence of two secondary amines rather than a formamidinium cation. Determined from the meHSQC spectrum. The relative configuration of the stereogenic centers in1was assigned by analyses of the3JH,Hcoupling constants and corresponding 2D ROESY and 1D NOE correlations. For example, the proton signal for H-8 was an apparent quartet with a3JH,Hvalue of 10.8 Hz, which indicated that H-8 wasantito three axial protons (H-7, H-9b, and H-13) (Figure2). On the basis of these data and the observation of ROESY cross-peaks between H-8/H-12b (dH-12b0.99), H-8/H-9a (dH-9a1.54), H-13/H-9b (dH-9b0.74), and H-13/H-11b (dH-11b1.14), the A ring was in a chair conformation. In addition, H-7 showed an NOE with H-16 and was thus assigned asynposition relative to H-16. Due to the presence of the double bond, the conformation of the B ring containing C-7 and C-16 was a half-chair conformation, a conclusion supported by stepwise molecular modeling calculations using the MMFF94 and AM1 force fields. A similar analysis of the NMR data of2established that it possessed the same relative configuration in those rings. The configurations of the olefins in1and2were assigned by analysis of the3JH,Hcoupling constants. Due to the strong second-order coupling for these olefinic protons (recorded in CD3OD or CDCl3),3JH,Hcoupling constants were determined in pyridine-d5in order to allow potential p-p interactions to disperse the proton chemical shifts. The resulting3JH,Hcoupling constants for the olefins (? 14,15and ? 24,25) were 9.2 and 9.6 Hz, respectively, suggestingZ-configurations, while the other olefin (? 17,18) displayed a vicinal coupling value of 15.0 Hz that indicated anE-configuration. Evaluation of the3JH,Hvalues for the olefinic methines in2established the same configurations. Conformational model of the AB ring system and selected experimental ROESY correlations (solid arrows) along with key3JH,Hvalues (dashed arrows) of1. Natural products containing a tetrahydropyrimidinium ring are uncommon. This motif is a component of haliclorensin B,Noneconvolutamine J,NoneN-methylmanzacidin C,Noneefrapeptin F,Nonephloeodictines,Noneand incasines B and B'. None,NoneIn our case, neopetrocyclamine B (2) appears to be a precursor to1, as a one-carbon transfer reaction would convert2to1. The mechanism by which formylation occurs may be similar to the biosynthesis of tetrahydrofolate cofactors. NoneSimilar proposals have been put forth for the biosynthesis of other formamidinium-containing natural products. For example, the tetrahydropyrimidinium ring of incasine B has been proposed to be generated via a one-carbon enzymatic formylation and subsequent cyclization. NoneOne final point of discussion is necessary concerning the relationship between1and2and whether1is an artifact of a reaction with our HPLC additive formic acid or its derivative, always a concern with natural products. Several lines of evidence suggest this is not the case here. First, direct coupling between2and formic acid is thermodynamically unfavorable, as it requires a nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction between an amine and a carboxylic acid when a thermodynamically more favorable reaction manifold exists, an acid-base reaction. The addition of simple acids or bases has little effect on the general feasibility of this nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction at room temperature, hence ruling out the formation of1via this route. A more likely scenario is the coupling of2with methyl formate, itself formed via a reaction between the chromatography solvent MeOH and the additive formic acid. Fortunately, this can be ruled out as well, as them/zcorresponding to1and2are clearly visible after the initial Kupchan partitioning in different fractions (CH2Cl2and hexane, respectively), before formic acid was even introduced to the samples during the final HPLC purification step. Taken together, the above considerations indicate that1is not an isolation artifact. Recently, LaBarbera et al. Nonereported that papuamine was an antimetastatic agent against MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, while Kanno et al. Nonereported it reduces cell survival through mitochondrial damage and JNK activation. On the basis of these reports, compounds1-4were screenedin vitroagainst a human glioblastoma (SF-295) cancer cell line and two human renal cancer cell lines (UO-31 and A498). Neither1nor2showed significant cytotoxicity at 20 uM. However, both3and4inhibited the growth of these three carcinoma cell lines, with GI50values ranging from 0.8 to 8.0 uM (Table3). In particular,3was more potent than4against glioblastoma SF-295 cells, as its GI50value was 8-fold lower. This suggested that the stereogenic center at C-6 of3was important for the cytotoxic effect. Compound3was nearly 4-fold more potent against glioblastoma cells when compared with renal cancer cells, whereas, in contrast,4was not. At this time, the specific molecular targets and mechanisms by which these compounds exert their antitumor effects are unknown. The numbers represent the GI50values as determined from quadruplicate measurements and are expressed in uM. This is the first report of the isolation of C3-diamine polycyclic alkaloids from a sponge of the genusNeopetrosia, which has been a rich source of marine alkaloids. None-NoneWhile the neopetrocyclamines represent a new carbon skeleton of polycyclic diamine alkaloids, the cross-distribution of papuamine alkaloids in different sponge genera, as well as their structural homology to the neopetrocyclamines, supports the hypothesis of the monophyletic evolution for sponges in the order Haplosclerida. None,NoneOptical rotations were measured on a Jasco DIP-370 digital polarimeter at the sodium D-line (589 nm). IR spectroscopy was measured as a thin film on a CaF2disk using a Shimadzu IRAffinity-1 FTIR. 1H,13C, and 2D NMR experiments were performed on a Varian Unity Inova 500 MHz spectrometer. NMR spectra were referenced to the appropriate residual solvent signal (dH3.30, dC49.1 for MeOH-d4; dH7.58, dC135.9 for pyridine-d5). The HSQC experiments were optimized for1JC,H= 140 Hz, and HMBC experiments for3JC,H= 7 Hz. Mixing times for ROESY and NOESY experiments were 500 ms, and generally 80 ms for the 1D TOCSY experiments. High-resolution mass spectrometric data were obtained on an LC-MS-TOF spectrometer using ESI mode. HPLC separations were performed on a Shimadzu LC-20AP system. The sponge sample designated 96-IND-70 was collected by scuba from a depth of 24 m at Old Derawan Pier, Indonesia (2.458 degrees N, 118.237 degrees E), on March 19, 1996. The sponge is most closely comparable toNeopetrosia exigua(Kirkpatrick, 1900) (order Haplosclerida, family Petrosiidae), characterized in life by a dark reddish-brown external coloration and cream interior, and has relatively small spicules of about 150 um long, set in a dense round-meshed reticulation, which produces a velvety surface. The sponge is thickly encrusting, and the texture relatively crumbly and very sticky to the touch. The surface is irregular with small oscules on mounds on the surface. Voucher specimens have been deposited at the Natural History Museum, London (NMHUK2012.3.27.1), as well as at the UH Manoa, Department of Chemistry (96-IND-70). A portion of the freeze-dried sample was exhaustively extracted with MeOH to yield 3.6 g of crude extract. This extract was subjected to a successive partition using a modified Kupchan procedure with hexane, CH2Cl2, EtOAc,n-BuOH, and H2O to yield five fractions of 0.2, 0.4, 0.02, 0.7, and 2.2 g, respectively. LC-MS analyses of these fractions revealed that organic phases contained a series of compounds with molecular weights between 360 and 400 amu corresponding to the pure compounds1-4. TLC experiments revealed that the spots of the organic fractions remained at the origin on either normal (silica, EtOAc) or reversed-phase (RP-C18, MeOH/H2O, 1:1) plates, but moved in both modes when either diethylamine (5%) or formic acid (0.1%) was added. The residue from the CH2Cl2phase (0.4 g) was chromatographed on a silica gel flash column (75 g) eluting with a step gradient of EtOAc/Et2NH (95:5), MeOH/EtOAc/Et2NH (25:70:5) (*2), MeOH/EtOAc/Et2NH (50:45:5) (*2), MeOH/EtOAc/Et2NH (75:20:5), and MeOH/Et2NH (95:5) to provide seven fractions (A-G). The known alkaloid haliclonadiamine (4) (122 mg) was thus isolated from fraction B. Separation of fraction C (130 mg) by reversed-phase HPLC [Luna C8, 250 * 10 mm, a linear gradient over 20 min from 20% to 100% MeOH in H2O with 0.1% formic acid added to both solvents, flow rate 2.75 mL/min, PDA detection] afforded neopetrocyclamine A (1) (tR17.2 min, 3.8 mg, 0.106% yield). The organic residue from the hexane phase (0.2 g) was thus chromatographed on a silica gel flash column (75 g) using EtOAc/Et2NH (95:5) to afford 25 fractions. These fractions were analyzed by LC-MS and combined with fraction 8 to 14 (total of 51 mg). This fraction was then washed with 10 mL of 1 N HCl and extracted with hexane (10 mL * 5) to remove fatty acids. The residue from the HCl aqueous phase (4 mg) was separated by reversed-phase HPLC [Kinetex C8, 100 * 4.6 mm, a linear gradient over 20 min from 10% to 50% MeOH in H2O with 0.1% formic acid added to both solvents, flow rate 0.7 mL/min, PDA detection] to afford neopetrocyclamine B (2) (tR12.4 min, 0.85 mg, 0.024% yield). The residue from then-BuOH phase (0.7 g) was also chromatographed on a silica gel flash column (125 g) using EtOAc/Et2NH (95:5) to obtain known alkaloids papuamine (3) (220 mg, 6.1% yield) and haliclonadiamine (4) (108 mg, 6.4% total yield) as the free bases.

Molecular modeling was constructed in the Chem3D interface. An MMFF94 force field was used to optimize the energy and geometry of1at a simulated temperature of 298 K (5000 iterations, rms convergence of 0.01 kcal/mol). The resulting structure was then subjected to the AM1 semiempirical method for a secondary minimization using a gradient algorithm at a simulated temperature of 298 K (1000 iterations, rms convergence of 0.001 kcal/mol). All bonds were treated as freely rotatable except for the alkenyl and formamidinium bonds. Cells were plated at a density of 5000 cells per well in a 96-well plate in 90 uL of culture media without phenol red or antibiotics. Cells were allowed to attach for 60 min under regular culture conditions. After the attachment, 10 uL of diluted compound or the solvent DMSO as control was added to the wells. Cells were incubated for 48 h with the compound before subjecting them to a cell proliferation assay (XTT) according to the manufacturer's protocol (Roche Diagnostics).
