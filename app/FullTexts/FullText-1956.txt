NoneDuring the phase I clinical trial of the therapeutic monoclonal antibody (mAb) TGN1412, a life-threatening 'cytokine storm' occurred that could have been predicted if new solid phase assays had been applied. NoneThis study reports cytokine release with a range of therapeutic mAbs using a solid phase assay and demonstrates that Muromonab-CD3 stimulates a TGN1412-like response. TGN1412 is an immunomodulatory CD28 super-agonistic mAb generated to balance therapeutically the immune system in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, leukaemia and multiple sclerosis1. During its first-in-man phase I clinical trial, TGN1412 caused a near fatal systemic inflammatory response in all six healthy trial volunteers, characterized by the rapid induction of pro-inflammatory cytokine release2. All six volunteers became critically ill with pulmonary infiltrates and lung injury, renal failure and disseminated intravascular coagulation necessitating transfer to intensive care for cardiopulmonary support and dialysis2. Prolonged cardiovascular shock and acute respiratory distress developed in two patients who required intensive organ support for 8-16 days2. All six patients survived but have a greatly increased chance of developing cancers and immune system disorders in later life. During the subsequent investigation it was confirmed that the trial material was not contaminated, had been correctly formulated and that pre-clinical safety tests, repeated with the same trial material, did not predict an adverse response in man3,4. It has now emerged that the choice of animal model chosen for pre-clinical safety testing of TGN1412, cynomolgus macaques, had been inappropriate because the CD4+ effector memory T-cell subset of this species does not express CD28 and, therefore, cannot be stimulated by CD28 agonists5. In contrast the CD4+ effector memory T-cell subset of man expresses high levels of CD28 and, therefore, can be stimulated by TGN1412, causing rapid release of high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines5. However, pre-clinicalin vitrosafety tests with human white blood cells and TGN1412 in aqueous phase did not elicit pro-inflammatory cytokine release despite the presence of CD4+ effector memory T-cells. It was postulated that pre-clinicalin vitrosafety tests did not replicatein vivopresentation of TGN1412 due to the biology of CD284, where engagement with the natural ligands CD80 and CD86 on antigen-presenting cells is localized at the point of cell-to-cell contact promoting the formation of an immunological synapse6. Presentation of TGN1412 in the aqueous phasein vitroassay would, therefore, involve engagement of CD28 outside of the immunological synapse or disruption of its formation, which is known to impede T-cell activation4,7,8. In order to mimic delivery of a localized signal, TGN1412 was coated onto the surface of tissue culture wells in a solid phase assay so that human T-cells could only interact with the mAb at one interface4. The result of this simple change in presentation was dramatic - massive pro-inflammatory cytokine release and lymphoproliferation that mirrored the responses to TGN1412 observed in trial volunteers4. The possibility that this response was an artefact was ruled out by the observation that white blood cells from cynomolgus macaques were not stimulated by TGN1412 in a solid phase assay at any dose4. The pro-inflammatory response to TGN1412 was human specific. Although the solid phase assay does not replicatein vivopresentation of TGN1412, which is not fully understood, it does induce substantial cytokine release equivalent to that reported in trial volunteers. Attempts to modelin vivopresentation of TGN1412 have focused on endothelial cell co-cultures4,9-11and more recently pre-culture of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) at high density12, with promising results. Whilst these approaches stimulate pro-inflammatory cytokine release with TGN1412 they do not yet mirror the high levels of IL-2 and IFNgamma release seen in trial volunteers and the solid phase assay, implying only partial replication ofin vivopresentation2,4,5. Despite the application of solid phase assays in the evaluation of emerging therapeutic mAbs, little comparative data exist that evaluate the pre-clinical value of this approach for predicting cytokine release syndrome (CRS), which we now address here. The following therapeutic mAbs were compared: TGN1412 (anti-CD28, IgG4kappa, TeGenero AG, Wuzburg, Germany), muromonab-CD3 (anti-CD3, murine IgG2a, Orthoclone-OKT3, Johnson and Johnson, New Jersey, USA), alemtuzumab (anti-CD52, IgG1, Alemtuzumab, Genzyme, Massachusetts, USA), rituximab (anti-CD20, IgG1, Mabthera, Roche, Basel, Switzerland), trastuzumab (anti-HER2, IgG1, herceptin, Roche), bevacizumab (anti-VEGF, IgG1, Avastin, Roche), daclizumab (anti-IL-2R, IgG1, Zenopax, Roche), basiliximab (anti-IL-2R, IgG1, Simulect, Novartis, Basel, Switzerland), etanercept (anti-TNFalpha, IgG1 fusion protein, Enbrel, Pfizer, New York, USA), Infliximab (anti-TNFalpha, IgG1, Remicade, Merck, New Jersey, USA), adalimumab (anti-TNFalpha, IgG1, Humira, Abbot, Illinois, USA) and natalizumab (anti-alpha4 integrin, IgG4kappa, Tysabri, Biogen IDEC, Massachusetts, USA). Purified human IgG1 and IgG4kappa, endotoxin and preservative free, were used as isotype controls (AMS Biotechnology Ltd, Abingdon, UK). The lectin phytohaemagglutinin (Sigma-Aldrich Ltd, Poole, UK) at 10 mug ml-1was used as a mitogen control. Responses to therapeutic mAbs were evaluated in both aqueous phase, at 1 mug well-1in 96 well tissue culture treated polystyrene microtitre plates, and in solid phase by coating 1 mug well-1in 60 mul of phosphate buffered saline onto non-tissue culture treated 96 well polypropylene microtitre plates (Corning Inc., Corning, NY, USA) for 1-2 h at room temperature followed by two washes to remove unbound mAb, as previously described5. A concentration of 1 mug well-1of therapeutic mAb was chosen for comparability with previously published findings on cytokine release using this method5. The drug/molecular target nomenclature follows Alexanderet al. 13. Human PBMC were isolated from heparinized blood, obtained from healthy donors, with local ethical consent HuMAC (06/022RS), by density gradient separation (Lymphoprep, Axis-Shield, Oslo, Norway), resuspended in RPMI 1640 culture medium (Sigma-Aldrich Ltd) supplemented with 15% foetal calf serum (v/v), 2 mmL-glutamine (Sigma-Aldrich Ltd), 50 U ml-1penicillin and 0.05 mg ml-1streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich Ltd), and rested overnight in a humidified incubator at 37 degrees C with 5% CO2. Donor PBMC were adjusted to 1 * 106cells ml-1and 200 mul were added to tissue culture plate wells in triplicate sets and incubated for 24, 48 and 72 h, respectively, for each method and therapeutic mAb tested, in a humidified incubator at 37 degrees C with 5% CO2. Culture supernatants harvested at 24, 48 and 72 h were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the cytokines IFNgamma, TNFalpha, IL-2 and IL-8 as previously described5,14, IL-17 and IL-22 using DuoSet(r) ELISA kits (R D Systems Inc, Minneapolis, MN, USA) and TGFbeta1 in acid activated samples using the antibody pair MAB240 and BAF240 according to manufacturer's instructions (R D Systems Inc., Abingdon, UK). The cytokines IFNgamma, TNFalpha, IL-1beta, IL-10, IL-12 p70, IL-13, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5 and IL-8 in culture supernatants harvested at 72 h were measured using Human Th1/Th2 7 and 10-Plex MSD(r) kits (Meso Scale Discovery, Gaithersburg, Maryland, USA), using a mix of corresponding WHO/NIBSC cytokine standards consisting of 86/680, 04/158, 88/656, 90/586, 89/520, 93/722, 95/544, 94/622, 88/786 and 88/606 (NIBSC, Potters Bar, UK) to prepare the calibration curve. Where cytokine release exceeded upper detection limits culture supernatants were diluted *10 or *40-fold prior to assay. Intracellular cytokine staining and immunophenotyping were performed as previously described4. The following antibody conjugates were used: anti-human CD3 PerCP, anti-human CD4 APC, anti-human TNFalpha PE (BD Biosciences, Oxford, UK), anti-human-CD3 PE-Cy7, anti-human CD4 APC-Cy7, anti-human CD25 APC, anti-human IFNgamma Pacific Blue, anti-human IL-2 PerCP/Cy5.5, anti-human IL-17 FITC (BioLegend Ltd, Cambridge, UK), anti-human IL-17 Alexa Fluor(r) 647 (eBioscience Ltd, Hatfield, UK) and anti-FoxP3 PE (Miltenyi Biotec, Surrey, UK). A minimum of 30 000 gated lymphocyte events per well was acquired using a FACSCanto II flow cytometer equipped with HTS plate reader and analyzed using FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences). Statistical analysis of cytokine release data was performed using Minitab 16 software (Minitab Ltd, Coventry, UK). A general linear model was employed for repeated measures analysis of log10transformed data using Dunnett's test with 95% confidence to counteract for multiple comparisons. The corresponding isotype control for each therapeutic mAb, for each time point, was used as the control group for comparisons: human IgG1 was used as the control for most therapeutic mAbs (including muromonab-CD3, a murine IgG2a) with the exception of TGN1412 and natalizumab for which an isotype-matched human IgG4kappa control was used. A difference was considered significant ifP less than 0.05. Cytokine release and magnitude data given are the geometric mean with 95% confidence interval of the geometric mean shown in brackets. ELISA and multiplex data consist of the mean responses of between seven and 16 donors from two to four independent experiments, respectively. All flow cytometry data consist of the mean responses of between eight and 12 donors from two to three independent experiments. A pairedt-test was used for comparisons of flow cytometry data. Group flow cytometry data shown are arithmetic mean +/- SEM. Cytokine release with different therapeutic mAbs presented in aqueous and solid phase assays was compared with isotype controls. In the solid phase assay both muromonab-CD3 and TGN1412 stimulated significant IL-2 release (bothP less than 0.0001 at 24, 48 and 72 h) at levels comparable with or exceeding mitogen, an immunological toxin, respectively (Figure 1). TGN1412 stimulated significantly more IL-2 release compared with muromonab-CD3 (P less than 0.0001 at 24, 48 and 72 h) (Figure 1). TGN1412 caused IL-2 concentration to increase steadily over 72 h, whereas a sharp decrease was noted at 72 h with muromonab-CD3 and mitogen (Figure 1). In the aqueous phase assay TGN1412 stimulated trace amounts of IL-2 release that was significant (P= 0.0080 at 24 h) compared with IgG4, but not IgG1 control (Figure 1). Muromonab-CD3 stimulated significant IL-2 release (P less than 0.0001 andP= 0.0081 at 24 and 48 h, respectively) in the aqueous phase assay, at a lower level than mitogen (Figure 1). It was noted that the anti-IL-2 receptor antibodies basiliximab and daclizumab caused a significant increase in IL-2 concentration (P= 0.0003 andP= 0.0004, respectively, at 48 h and for bothP less than 0.0001 at 72 h) (Figure 1). Conversely, a significant decrease in IL-2 concentration was noted with the anti-TNFalpha mAbs adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab (P= 0.0038,P= 0.0019 andP= 0.0001, respectively, at 72 h), in the aqueous phase assay (Table 1). IL-2 released from human PBMC stimulatedin vitrofor 24, 48 and 72 h with 1 mug well-1of indicated therapeutic mAbs in solid phase (A) and aqueous (B) phase, measured by ELISA. IL-2 release in pg ml-1of culture supernatant is shown on a log10scale. The lectin PHA at 10 mug ml-1was used as mitogen control. All responses were compared to IgG1 isotype control with the exception of TGN1412 and natalizumab which were compared with IgG4kappa isotype control, for respective time points. Group responses shown are geometric means, error bars shown are 95% confidence intervals. * Denotes a response significantly greater than the respective control (repeated measures analysis of log10transformed data using Dunnett's method and 95% confidence).

Group responses shown are geometric mean followed by 95% confidence interval in brackets. Significant results are shown in bold (repeated measures analysis of log10transformed data using Dunnett's method and 95.0% confidence). Donor responses shown (n= 7-16) are from 2-4 independent experimentsMuromonab-CD3 and TGN1412 stimulated significant IFNgamma release (bothP less than 0.0001 at 24, 48 and 72 h), at levels comparable with mitogen (Table 2). Muromonab-CD3 also stimulated significant IFNgamma release in the aqueous phase assay (P less than 0.0001 at 24, 48 and 72 h), but TGN1412 did not. Alemtuzumab stimulated low but significant levels of IFNgamma release (P= 0.0020 andP= 0.0007 at 24 and 72 h, respectively) in the aqueous phase assay, but not in the solid phase assay (Table 2). Natalizumab, adalimumab, infliximab, etanercept, basiliximab, daclizumab, bevacizumab, trastuzumab and rituximab did not stimulate significant IFNgamma release in either aqueous or solid phase assays (Table 2). IFNgamma release from human PBMC stimulatedin vitrofor 24, 48 and 72 h with 1 mug well-1of indicated therapeutic mAbs in aqueous and solid phase. Cytokine release was measured by ELISA. The lectin PHA at 10 mug ml-1was used as mitogen control. All responses were compared with IgG1 isotype control with the exception of TGN1412 and natalizumab which were compared with IgG4kappa isotype control. Group responses shown are geometric mean followed by 95% confidence interval in brackets. Significant results are shown in bold (repeated measures analysis of log10transformed data using Dunnett's method and 95% confidence). Donor responses shown (n= 7-16) are from 2-4 independent experimentsMuromonab-CD3 stimulated significant TNFalpha release in the solid and aqueous phase assay (bothP less than 0.0001 at 24, 48 and 72 h), at levels comparable with mitogen (Table 3). Similarly, TGN1412 stimulated significant TNFalpha release in the solid (P less than 0.0001 at 24, 48 and 72 h) and aqueous phase assay (P= 0.0113,P= 0.0168 andP= 0.0363 at 24, 48 and 72 h, respectively), but TNFalpha release was 238 (53.5-1061) fold lower in the latter (Table 3). Significant TNFalpha release was noted with bevacizumab (P= 0.0001 at 24 h), trastuzumab (P= 0.0031 andP= 0.0423 at 24 and 48 h, respectively) and alemtuzumab (P= 0.0177 andP= 0.0387 at 24 and 48 h, respectively) in the solid phase assay (Table 3). Increased TNF-alpha release with daclizumab and rituximab was not significant (Table 3). This was only repeated with alemtuzumab (P less than 0.0001 andP= 0.0002 at 24 and 48 h, respectively) in the aqueous phase assay (Table 3). The anti-TNFalpha mAbs adalimumab, infliximab and etanercept significantly reduced TNFalpha concentration in aqueous (at 24 hP= 0.0006,P= 0.0005 andP= 0.0126, respectively, allP less than 0.0001 at 48 and 72 h) and solid phase assays (allP less than 0.0001 at 24, 48 and 72 h) (Table 3). A significant reduction in TNFalpha release with natalizumab in the solid phase assay (P= 0.0001,P less than 0.0001 andP less than 0.0001 at 24, 48 and 72 h, respectively) and daclizumab in the aqueous phase assay (P= 0.0245 at 24 h) was noted (Table 3). TNFalpha release from human PBMC stimulatedin vitrofor 24, 48 and 72 h with 1 mug well-1of indicated therapeutic mAbs in aqueous and solid phase. Cytokine release was measured by ELISA. The lectin PHA at 10 mug ml-1was used as mitogen control. All responses were compared with IgG1 isotype control with the exception of TGN1412 and natalizumab which were compared with IgG4kappa isotype control. Group responses shown are geometric mean followed by 95% confidence interval in brackets. Significant results are shown in bold (repeated measures analysis of log10transformed data using Dunnett's method and 95% confidence). Donor responses shown (n= 7-16) are from 2-4 independent experimentsComparable levels of IL-8 release were observed with muromonab-CD3 and TGN1412 in the solid phase assay, but only the latter response was significant (P less than 0.0001 at 24, 48 and 72 h). A high level of IL-8 release with IgG1 but not IgG4 control in the solid phase assay accounted for this statistical difference (Table 4). In the aqueous phase assay muromonab-CD3 and alemtuzumab stimulated significant levels of IL-8 release (bothP less than 0.0001 at 24, 48 and 72 h), but TGN1412 did not at 24 and 48 h (Table 4). The anti-TNFalpha mAbs adalimumab, infliximab and etanercept all significantly reduced IL-8 concentration at 24 (P= 0.0022,P= 0.0005 andP= 0.0045, respectively), 48 (P= 0.0001,P= 0.0020 andP= 0.0065, respectively) and at 72 h (allP less than 0.0001) in the aqueous phase assay, whereas in the solid phase assay only etanercept significantly reduced IL-8 concentration (P less than 0.0001 at 24, 48 and 72 h) (Table 4). The anti-alpha4 integrin mAb natalizumab also decreased IL-8 concentration in the aqueous (P= 0.0013 andP= 0.0163 at 24 and 48 h, respectively) and solid phase assays (P less than 0.0001,P= 0.0005 andP= 0.0001 at 24, 48 and 72 h, respectively), compared with IgG4 control (Table 4). Lastly, a decrease in IL-8 levels in the aqueous phase assay, compared with IgG1 control, was noted with daclizumab (P= 0.0008 at 24 h) and bevacizumab (P= 0.0048 at 24 h) (Table 4). IL-8 release from human PBMC stimulatedin vitrofor 24, 48 and 72 h with 1 mug well-1of indicated therapeutic mAbs in aqueous and solid phase. Cytokine release was measured by ELISA. The lectin PHA at 10 mug ml-1was used as mitogen control. All responses were compared with IgG1 isotype control with the exception of TGN1412 and natalizumab which were compared with IgG4kappa isotype control. Group responses shown are geometric mean followed by 95% confidence interval in brackets. Significant results are shown in bold (repeated measures analysis of log10transformed data using Dunnett's method and 95% confidence). Donor responses shown (n= 7-16) are from 2-4 independent experimentsOnly muromonab-CD3 and TGN1412 stimulated significant IL-17 release (allP less than 0.0001 at 24, 48 and 72 h) in the solid phase assay, at levels comparable with mitogen, and only muromonab-CD3 stimulated significant IL-17 release in the aqueous phase assay (P less than 0.0001 at 24, 48 and 72 h) (Table 5). In contrast to other therapeutic mAbs evaluated, only muromonab-CD3 and TGN1412 stimulated in the solid phase assay a cytokine profile consistent with a mitogen response. The major difference between these two therapeutic mAbs was the ability of TGN1412 to stimulate 28.4 (18.6-43.8) fold more IL-2 release than muromonab-CD3 in the solid phase assay, after 24 h.IL-17 release from human PBMC stimulatedin vitrofor 24, 48 and 72 h with 1 mug well-1of indicated therapeutic mAbs in aqueous and solid phase. Cytokine release was measured by ELISA. The lectin PHA at 10 mug ml-1was used as mitogen control. All responses were compared with IgG1 isotype control with the exception of TGN1412 and natalizumab which were compared with IgG4kappa isotype control. Group responses shown are geometric mean followed by 95% confidence interval in brackets. Significant results are shown in bold (repeated measures analysis of log10transformed data using Dunnett's method and 95% confidence). Donor responses shown (n= 7-16) are from 2-4 independent experimentsSince the pattern of cytokine release stimulated by TGN1412 and muromonab-CD3 in the solid phase assay was consistent with a CD4+ Th1 (IFNgamma) and Th17 (IL-17) response, a wider panel of cytokines was measured to determine if other T helper cell subsets were involved. Using a Th1/Th2 multiplex assay muromonab-CD3 and TGN1412 were found to stimulate significant (allP less than 0.0001) IFNgamma, IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5,IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13 and TNFalpha release after 72 h (Table 6). In contrast, rituximab and alemtuzumab did not stimulate significant release of IFNgamma, IL-2, IL-5, IL-10, IL-12 or IL-13 (Table 6). Multiplex analysis of IFNgamma and IL-2 release, with muromonab-CD3 and TGN1412, was comparable with ELISA data generated using different donors. Interestingly, muromonab-CD3 stimulated significantly more IL-1beta (P= 0.0073) and IL-10 (P less than 0.0001) release than TGN1412 (Table 6). To determine if TGN1412 stimulated CD4+ Th22 or regulatory T-cells (Tregs), IL-22 and TGFbeta release were measured by ELISA after 72 h (Table 6). Muromonab-CD3 and TGN1412 stimulated significant (bothP less than 0.0001) IL-22 release in the solid phase assay (Table 6). TGN1412 stimulated significant TGFbeta release (P less than 0.0001) compared with IgG4 control, but the level was equivalent to that obtained with IgG1 control, rituximab and muromonab-CD3 (Table 6). Cytokine release from human PBMC stimulatedin vitrofor 72 h in a solid phase assay with 1 mug well-1of indicated therapeutic mAbs. Th1/Th2 7 and 10-Plex MSD(r) kits was used to measure IFNgamma, TNFalpha, IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12 and IL-13 release. Cytokine ELISA was used to measure IL-22 and TGFbeta release. The lectin PHA 10 mugml-1was used as mitogen control. All responses were compared with IgG1 isotype control with the exception of TGN1412 which was compared with IgG4kappa isotype control. Group responses shown are geometric mean followed by 95% confidence interval in brackets. Significant results are shown in bold (repeated measures analysis of log10transformed data using Dunnett's method and 95% confidence). Donor responses shown (n= 7-16) are from 2-4 independent experimentsSince TGN1412 and Muromonab-CD3 stimulated a similar pattern of cytokine release, then it could be hypothesized that both stimulate the same cellular subsets. To test this premise, we examined the cellular sources of IL-2, IFNgamma and IL-17 release after overnight stimulation with therapeutic mAbs. Both TGN1412 and muromonab-CD3 stimulated cytokine release from CD4+ T-cells (Figure 2A). Muromonab-CD3 stimulated CD4+ T-cell cytokine release comparable with mitogen (data not shown). However, TGN1412 stimulated significantly more CD4+ T-cells that produced IL-2 (P= 0.0001), IL-17 (P= 0.0008) and IFNgamma (P= 0.0309) compared with muromonab-CD3 (Figure 2A). Moreover, stimulation of 28.4 +/- 5.04 fold more IL-2 producing CD4+ T-cells by TGN1412 compared with muromonab-CD3 matches the magnitude difference in IL-2 release. Alemtuzumab did not stimulate CD4+ T-cell cytokine release (Figure 2A). Neither did adalimumab, infliximab, etanercept, basiliximab, daclizumab, bevacizumab, trastuzumab or rituximab (data not shown). Alemtuzumab and muromonab-CD3 stimulated significantly more CD4- cells that produced IFNgamma (P= 0.0014 andP= 0.0115, respectively), compared with TGN1412 (Figure 2A). These CD4- cells were mostly CD3- NK cells with some CD3+CD8+ T-cells, and reflected an NK cell pattern of cytokine release with alemtuzumab, muromonab-CD3 and rituximab (data not shown). Comparison of IFNgammavs.IL-17 producing CD4+ T-cells confirmed that these are separate populations corresponding to TH1 and TH17 cell subsets, respectively (Figure 2B). Muromonab-CD3 stimulated TH1 and TH17 cells that characteristically produced either IFNgamma or IL-17, respectively (Figure 2C), whereas TGN1412 stimulated TH1 and TH17 cells that co-release IL-2, yielding a different pattern of CD4+ T-cell mediated cytokine release (Figure 2C). This same pattern of IL-2 co-production with TGN1412 was observed with IL-13 (Th2) and IL-22 (Th22) producing cells (data not shown). In addition, a large proportion of TGN1412 stimulated CD4+ T-cells appeared to produce only IL-2 (Figure 2C). Intracellular cytokine staining of human PBMC stimulated for 24 h with 1 mug well-1alemtuzumab, muromonab-CD3 and TGN1412 in a solid phase assay. CD4+ cells are shown in red and CD4- cells in green. (A) shows CD4vs. IL-2, IFNgamma and IL-17, (B) shows IFNgammavs. IL-17 gated on CD4+ cells and (C) shows IL-2vs. IFNgamma and IL-17 gated on CD4+ cells. Th1 cells are IFNgamma+ and Th17 are IL-17+. TGN 1412 stimulates cytokine release from CD4+ cells, muromonab-CD3 from CD4+ and CD4- cells and alemtuzumab from CD4- cells. Data from one representative donor are shown. For comparison, the mitogen response of eight donors was 3.4 +/- 0.79% CD4+IL-2+, 0.44 +/- 0.06% CD4+IFNgamma+ and 0.03 +/- 0.01% CD4+IL-17+ (not shown). None, CD4+;None, CD4-In rodent models, treatment with CD28 super-agonists, orthologous to TGN1412, stimulated the release of anti-inflammatory cytokines and the expansion of CD4+ Tregs believed to counter autoimmune responses15-17. To determine if TGN1412 specifically expands human CD4+ Tregs in the solid phase assay we assessed the proportion of CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ cells. Stimulation of human PBMC with TGN1412 and muromonab-CD3 for 24 and 72 h significantly (allP less than 0.0001) increased the proportion of CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ cells compared with isotype controls (Figure 3). Intranuclear and surface staining of human PBMC stimulated for 24 and 72 h with 1 mug well-1muromonab-CD3, TGN1412, IgG1 and IgG4kappa isotype controls in a solid phase assay. CD3+CD4+ T-cells are shown in red. Events in the right hand quadrants are positive for FoxP3 and events in the upper quadrants are positive for CD25. T-cells with the regulatory phenotype CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ are increased following stimulation with muromonab-CD3 (8.4 +/- 1.5% and 20.7 +/- 1.7% at 24 and 72 h, respectively) and TGN1412 (11.3 +/- 1.9% and 15.6 +/- 1.6% at 24 and 72 h, respectively), compared with isotype controls. Data from one representative donor are shown. None, CD3+ CD4+Correctly predicting the cytokine releasing properties of new therapeutic mAbs is a major safety concern recently emphasized by the 'cytokine storm' and near fatalities of volunteers administered TGN1412 in a first-in-man phase 1 clinical trial2. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is associated with a number of therapeutic mAbs and carries a high morbidity and fatality rate18-21. For example, severe CRS occurs in approximately 50% of recipients administered muromonab-CD3, to treat renal allograft rejection, if not pre-treated with high dose corticosteroids22,23. Moderate to severe CRS is associated with the use of alemtuzumab, for the treatment of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and rituximab, for the treatment of haematological neoplasms and lymphomas, in a minority of patients21,24-26. Yet many therapeutic mAbs such as bevacizumab, used for the treatment of metastatic cancers, and infliximab, used to treat Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis, are not associated with CRS10. Currently, no fully validatedin vitroassay that can predict CRS associated with the use of novel therapeutic mAbs exists20. Ideally, in terms of predicting the safety of novel therapeutic mAbs in man, a cytokine release assay (CRA) should rank bevacizumab and infliximab greater than alemtuzumab and rituximab greater than muromonab-CD3 greater than TGN1412. New solid phase cytokine release assays are now being widely applied to the pre-clinical safety testing of therapeutic mAbs in order to prevent a re-occurrence of the TGN1412 trial failure, but little comparative data exist to demonstrate the predictive value of this new approach for determining the safety or potential CRS severity when applied to other therapeutic mAbs27,28. The solid phase assay carried out using PBMC is predictive of CRS severity associated with the use of TGN1412 and muromonab-CD3. Similar levels of TNFalpha, IFNgamma, IL-8 and IL-17 release were obtained with both of these therapeutic mAbs, but IL-2 release was 28.4-fold greater with TGN1412. A similar order of magnitude difference is mirrored in renal allograft patients who are not pre-treated with high dose corticosteroids and whose serum concentrations of IL-2 peak at around 400 pg ml-1after muromonab-CD3 administration23, compared with greater than 4000 pg ml-1in TGN1412 trial volunteers2. This difference implies that massive IL-2 release was the driving force responsible for CRS severity associated with TGN1412 compared with muromonab-CD3. It should be noted that CRS associated with muromonab-CD3 is self-limiting due to depletion of CD3+ T-cells by this therapeutic mAb, whereas TGN1412 does not cause lysis of CD28+ T-cells, so would not be self-limiting. The cytokine profile obtained with both TGN1412 and muromonab-CD3 is consistent with a T-cell mediated response which is different from that observed with other therapeutic mAbs tested here which do not induce this type of cytokine release. With the exception of IL-8, the level of cytokine release with TGN1412 and muromonab-CD3 was markedly higher compared with other therapeutic mAbs, consistent with CRS severity associated with these therapeutic mAbs. A statistical difference in cytokine release was observed between therapeutic mAbs known to cause CRS and those that do not. Therefore, a similar statistical difference in cytokine release with a candidate mAb is likely to indicate the potential to cause CRS. In the case of TGN1412, where the magnitude of cytokine release was greater than mitogen control, the potential to cause CRS is evident and can be used to define clear criteria: a level of cytokine release similar to TGN1412 or muromonab-CD3 is likely to cause CRS. However, this is at one end of the CRS scale which covers a continuous range of responses whereas at the lower end only a small proportion of patients may experience low to moderate CRS. In such cases observed increases in cytokine release may not always be statistically significant, but this does not exclude the possibility of causing CRS, e.g. alemtuzumab and rituximab. In contrast to TGN1412 and muromonab-CD3, the solid phase assay was not predictive of moderate to severe CRS associated with alemtuzumab and rituximab compared with non-CRS associated bevacizumab and infliximab and the IgG1 isotype control. Comparable levels of IFNgamma, TNFalpha and IL-8 release observed with these therapeutic mAbs did not permit ranking of responses. Exceptions included the anti-TNFalpha therapeutic mAbs infliximab, adalimumab and the fusion protein etanercept, which reduced TNFalpha release in both the solid and aqueous phase assays, probably by binding to this cytokine and preventing measurement, and natalizumab which suppressed TNFalpha and IL-8 release in the solid phase assay compared with the IgG4kappa isotype control. Reduced IL-8 release was likely secondary to reduced TNFalpha release which regulates IL-8 release29. Increased levels of IFNgamma, TNFalpha and IL-8 release in the solid phase compared with aqueous phase assay with the IgG1 isotype control, alemtuzumab, rituximab, trastuzumab, bevacizumab, daclizumab, basiliximab, etanercept, infliximab and adalimumab, but not TGN1412, muromonab-CD3 or natalizumab is likely to be non-specific. Random orientation of immobilized mAb such that both the fragment crystallisable region (Fc) and fragment antigen-binding region (Fab) are presented at high density to lymphocytes is the likely culprit. This mechanism of cytokine release would likely involve engagement of CD16 (FcgammaRIII) on NK cells by the Fc component of immobilized therapeutic mAbs25. This conclusion is supported by low levels of cytokine release with the IgG4kappa isotype control, which has low affinity for Fc receptors and is therefore less likely to stimulate NK cells30. Moreover, the reason that IL-2 and IL-17 release is not observed with either alemtuzumab, rituximab, bevacizumab, infliximab or the IgG1 isotype control is that NK cells do not produce these cytokines. To exclude the contribution of the Fc component in a solid phase assay, it may be necessary to orientate therapeutic mAbs such that only the Fab component is presented to PBMC, for example by using Fc-capture antibody for immobilization5. Therapeutic mAb Fc-receptor interaction induces a mechanism of cytokine release that is different from that stimulated by TGN1412, which is Fab-mediated, and whichin vivois likely a function of target antigen and cell density. The cytokine response to TGN1412 in the trial volunteers occurred rapidly, within 4 h, and we have previously shown that the cytokine responsein vitrooccurs with the same rapid kinetics by intracellular cytokine staining and cytokine PCR5. However,in vitroassays utilize peripheral blood lymphocytes that contain few CD4+ effector memory T-cells, previously identified as the source of most of the pro-inflammatory cytokine release triggered by TGN14125. In contrast, CD4+ effector memory T-cells are found in high numbers in mucosal and lymphoid tissues within the body which likely accounted for the rapid release of high levels of cytokines in the trial volunteers. Forin vitrostudies, 24 h incubation was utilized to allow the low numbers of CD4+ effectors present in peripheral blood lymphocytes to release levels of cytokines consistent within vivoresponses. A 72 h incubation was required for certain cytokines such as IFNgamma to reach levels seen in the trial volunteers due to the time required for peripheral blood lymphocytes to differentiate into effector memory T-cells capable of producing this cytokine. The aqueous phase assay appears more predictive of the severity of non T-cell mediated CRS, where the target cell is present in blood, as is the case with alemtuzumab that targets lymphocytes and rituximab that targets B-cells. Significant increases in TNFalpha and IL-8 release with alemtuzumab and non-significant increases in these cytokines with rituximab hint at potential CRS severity ranking, when compared with muromonab-CD3. Significant increases in IL-2 concentration with basiliximab and daclizumab, which target the IL-2 receptor (CD25), were likely due to autocrine or paracrine accumulation caused by receptor blockade. Muromonab-CD3 produced an unequivocal cytokine response using the aqueous phase assay that was remarkably similar in magnitude to the solid phase assay response at 24 h. Thereafter, IL-2 release with muromonab-CD3 declined in the aqueous phase assay as this cytokine is only transiently produced after T-cell activation and consumed by proliferating T-cells. In the solid phase assay, IL-2 release stimulated by muromonab-CD3 peaked later at 48 h, probably amplifying other cytokine release over time due to IL-2 driven T-cell proliferation, but declined by 72 h indicating T-cell unresponsiveness. However, with TGN1412, IL-2 release and T-cell proliferation continued unabated over 72 h. Normally, IL-2 differentially regulates its own receptors, so continued T-cell proliferation and prevention of T-cell unresponsiveness by TGN1412 in the solid phase assay is not normal and may have been a consequence of prolonged expression of the IL-2Ralpha and beta-chains, up-regulated by CD28 co-stimulation31. The ability of TGN1412 to stimulate 28.4 fold more IL-2 release than muromonab-CD3 correlates with its ability to stimulate 28.4 times more CD4+ T-cells to produce this cytokine, after 24 h. However, a higher percentage of CD4+ T-cells producing IFNgamma and IL-17 with TGN1412 compared with muromonab-CD3 was not so clearly reflected in ELISA data, but those differences were small in comparison with IL-2. Furthermore, muromonab-CD3 also stimulated an NK cell mediated mechanism of cytokine release similar to alemtuzumab, which may have masked differences in IFNgamma release by CD4+ T-cells. Since muromonab-CD3 stimulates both T-cell and NK cell mediated cytokine release it could be expected to stimulate more cytokine release than TGN1412, which only stimulates CD4+ T-cells. However this was not the case, highlighting the significant role that IL-2 release likely played in amplifying cytokine release stimulated by TGN1412. IL-2 is a T-cell growth factor produced during the primary immune response which declines upon differentiation to be replaced by Th1-like (promotes cellular immunity), Th2-like (promotes humoral immunity), Th17-like (implicated in autoimmune disease) and Th22 (implicated in inflammatory skin disease) cytokines32,33. This is consistent with the cytokine profile observed with muromonab-CD3 in the aqueous phase assay where IL-2 release declines after 24 h, but in the solid phase assay IL-2 production continues to increase. In the case of TGN1412, a short circuit of the immune system, possibly due to prolonged activation of IL-2 transcription via super-agonistic CD28 stimulation may have caused continued IL-2 release34. TGN1412 and muromonab-CD3 produce high levels of IFNgamma consistent with a Th1 response, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and IL-13 consistent with a Th2 response, IL-17 consistent with a Th17 response and IL-22 consistent with a Th22 response. This T-cell specific cytokine response was not observed with rituximab, alemtuzumab, bevacizumab, infliximab and the IgG1 isotype control, expanding the list of TGN1412 and muromonab-CD3 specific biomarkers. The CD4+ Tregs subset is responsible for maintaining peripheral tolerance and homeostasis35, and the development of TGN1412 was based on pre-clinical findings in rodent models where CD28 super-agonists had been successfully used to expand the Treg compartment and suppress autoimmune and inflammatory disease models1,15-17. These CD4+ regulatory T-cells can be divided into natural Tregs (nTregs) that develop in the thymus and inducible Tregs (iTregs) generated in the periphery36. The iTregs subset includes Tr1 cells that produce IL-10 and T helper 3 cells (Th3) that produce TGFbeta. Since TGN1412 did not stimulate more TGFbeta release than other therapeutic mAbs, then a major role for a Th3 response is unlikely, but TGN1412 did stimulate significant IL-10 release consistent with a Tr1 response. However, IL-10 release is also consistent with a Th2 response and muromonab-CD3 stimulates greater IL-10 release than TGN1412, making an expansion of Tr1 cells unlikely. A feature of nTregs is expression of high levels of the IL-2 receptor (CD25) and the forkhead box P3 (FoxP3) transcription factor essential for their function, although non-regulatory T-cells can transiently express FoxP3 when activated35,37and CD25 is a CD4+ T-cell activation marker38. Stimulation of PBMC with TGN1412 in the solid phase assay led to a prolonged expansion of CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ T-cells that could be interpreted as expansion of nTregs, if it were not for a similar expansion caused by muromonab-CD3. Moreover, stimulation with immobilized CD3 mAb is known to increase FoxP3 expression that is strongly associated with hypo-responsiveness by activated CD4+ T-cells and is not directly correlated with suppressive capability37. It is, therefore, likely that this is also the case with TGN1412 in the solid phase assay since both TGN1412 and muromonab-CD3 stimulate a similar cytokine response. A complicated picture is emerging in which multiple mechanisms of cytokine release involving NK cells, T-cells, combinations of both and subsets of these cells can be involved in CRS associated with the use of therapeutic mAbs. Furthermore, it may not be possible to evaluate all these possibilities with a single cytokine release assay. Co-culture assays that can better replicate physiological presentation may be the way forward but these are technically demanding and so far only partially replicate cytokine responses to TGN14129. Nevertheless, a greater understanding of the mechanisms of cytokine release that therapeutic mAbs can stimulate can only aid in future prediction of potential CRS in man.
