The miR-200 family consists of five microRNAs (miRNAs: miR-141, 200a, 200b, 200c and 429) located in two intergenic genomic clusters on chromosomes 1 and 12 in humans. Several reports highlighted the impact of the miR-200 in cancer development and progression12345678910. The miR-200 family regulates key processes in tumorigenesis, such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition511121314151617, migration and invasion181920, stem cell maintenance6212223, stromal remodelling2425and oxidative stress response7262728. Moreover, miR-200 expression is induced by oxidative stress in various cells and tissues72628293031. Finally, these miRNAs accumulate and play a key role in ovarian tumorigenesis and chemosensitivity, the oxidative stress response being one important feature24579103233343536. Given the important role of miR-200 family members in oxidative stress response and ovarian tumorigenesis, understanding their regulation in these conditions is of major interest. Here we focus on the regulation of the intergenic miR-200 genomic cluster comprising miR-200c and miR-141. Previous studies have identified ZEB1/ZEB2 and p53 transcription factors as regulators of the expression of these miRNAs1115373839. Moreover, epigenetic marks such as DNA and histone methylation have also been linked to miR-200 expression, especially between epithelial and mesenchymal cells40414243. However, despite these efforts, the regulatory mechanisms involved in miR-200 expression are still far from being completely understood. In contrast to intronic miRNAs that are frequently transcribed along with their host genes, it is widely assumed that the regulation of intergenic miRNAs, such as miR-200c and miR-141, relies on their own promoters4445. We show here that transcription of intergenic miRNAs can also be modulated by their surrounding genes. Indeed, alternative polyadenylation (APA) and transcriptional read-through of an upstream gene can be new means of producing intergenic miRNAs. APA concerns about half of the human genes. APA shortens or lengthens the 3'-extremity of messenger RNAs and subsequently affects mRNA stability or protein translation46. Although it has not yet been described to date, a new outcome for APA could be the transcription of miRNAs located between two alternative polyA sites. Another yet unexplored mechanism that could also participate in the regulation of intergenic miRNA expression is a chromatin interaction between its promoter and another regulatory locus. Recent reports underline the functionality of both long-range and short-range chromatin contacts474849. Short-range DNA loops can bring together the promoter and terminator regions of the same gene. This type of DNA conformation, called 'gene-loop', plays a role in transcriptional memory and directionality and has been identified from yeast to mammals50. However, the role of such DNA interactions on intergenic miRNA regulation has not been established so far. Here, we show evidence that the miR-200c/141 intergenic cluster is regulated through two original complementary mechanisms: the read-through of the transcription of a neighbouring gene and the three-dimensional (3D) chromatin interaction involving the miRNA promoter region. We demonstrate that the transcription of miR-200c/141 is tightly associated with that ofPTPN6(also calledSHP1), a gene whose 3' extremity is located less than 3 kilobases upstream of the miRNAs. We show that the bypass of the usualPTPN6polyadenylation signal can lead to the transcription of miR-200c/141, and we reveal the existence of a 3D DNA conformation associating the promoters of these two genes. Together, our data indicate a physiological relevance ofPTPN6expression inmiR-200c/141regulation in all tested situations. We propose that the systematic correlation between these two genes in several different contexts is due to transcriptional read-through of thePTPN6gene and a previously unexplored type of DNA loop associating two closely located promoters. Regulation of miR-200c and miR-141 (hereafter referred to as miR-200c/141) expression represents a crucial step in ovarian tumorigenesis and stress response. A better understanding of their regulation deserved further investigation in these two related pathophysiological conditions. As both miR-200c and miR-141 are transcribed from the same genomic locus, we first observed that the levels of the two mature miRNAs were directly proportional to their corresponding primary transcript (below referred to aspri-miR-200c-141) in the diverse conditions analysed, that is, following acute oxidative stress and in high-grade ovarian carcinomas (HGSOC;Fig. 1a-dandSupplementary Fig. 1a,b). Indeed, the kinetics of miR-200c/141 accumulation after exposure to H2O2followed the increase ofpri-miR-200c-141transcript in epithelial or fibroblast cell lines from both human or mouse origin (Fig. 1a,bandSupplementary Fig. 1a,b). We detected oxidative stress-mediated miR-200c/141 upregulation in all cell lines tested, except those already expressing high basal concentrations of the miR-200c/141, such as IGROV-1 cell line (Supplementary Fig. 1d). Similarly, basal levels of mature and primary miR-200c/141 were found significantly correlated in different ovarian and breast cancer cell lines (Fig. 1c) as well as in a cohort of 107 human primary HGSOC (Fig. 1dandSupplementary Table 1for description of the cohort). This suggested that the accumulation of miR-200c and miR-141 relies mainly on the regulation of their transcription, rather than on maturation steps. Accordingly, treatment with actinomycin D, an effective transcriptional inhibitor, abolished the increase of miR-200c and miR-141 upon H2O2exposure (Fig. 1e,f). Thus, our data suggest that transcription is a major regulatory step controlling the accumulation of mature miR-200c/141. We first observed that neither ZEB nor TP53 protein was involved in the upregulation of miR-200c/141 by oxidative stress in ovarian cancer cell lines (Supplementary Fig. 1c), suggesting that the mechanism involved was complementary to those previously described. We thus analysed the genomic locus from which these miRNAs are transcribed (Fig. 2a). We first tested whether transcription of the miR-200c/141 neighbouring genes could be affected by acute oxidative stress. We observed that the transcription of the immediate upstream gene,PTPN6, was significantly increased following H2O2treatment, whereas the downstream gene,PHB2, remained invariant (Fig. 2b). Interestingly, the kinetics ofPTPN6upregulation was strikingly similar to this one of the miR-200c/141 primary transcript,pri-miR-200c-141(Fig. 2b). The coupling betweenPTPN6andmiR-200c/141primary transcripts upon stress was observed in 12 different cell lines (Fig. 2bandSupplementary Fig. 1b), suggesting a conserved mechanism of co-regulation in mammals. Moreover, this coupled transcription was also observed upon treatments increasing reactive oxygen species (Fig. 2c). Furthermore, the remarkable association betweenpri-miR-200c-141andpri-PTPN6transcription was not restricted to stress conditions but also observed at basal state in ovarian and breast cancer cell lines (Fig. 2d). We further confirmed this result by validating the correlation betweenPTPN6and miR-200c/141 levels in publicly available data sets from two large cell line panels, the NCI60 panel and the Sanger Cell Line Project (Fig. 2e,f). Taken together, these results demonstrate that miR-200c/141 andPTPN6transcriptions are tightly associated in a variety of cell lines at basal state and upon oxidative stress. As miR-200c/141 have been repeatedly defined as key regulators of human ovarian tumorigenesis57910153233343536, we next wondered whether the correlation of expression between miR-200c/141 andPTPN6was also observed in HGSOC. We first observed that the expression of the two miRNAs (Fig. 3a) and their corresponding primary transcript (Fig. 3b) were correlated withPTPN6mRNA levels in a cohort of 107 HGSOC (Fig. 3a,b). Correlation between miR-200c/141 andPTPN6expression was further validated in the publicly available The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database51composed by 574 HGSOC patients (Fig. 3cand details of the cohort are given inSupplementary Table 1). Genomic amplifications have been previously described in HGSOC on the chromosome 12p13, including the genomic locus from which themiR-200c/141andPTPN6are transcribed51. We hypothesized that genomic amplification could contribute to the observed correlation betweenPTPN6andpri-miR-200c-141transcription levels in these tumours. We thus computed the Transcription Correlation Scores (TCS) of this genomic region (Supplementary Fig. 2), TCS reflecting the degree of correlation of each gene with its neighbours, as defined previously52. We observed a peak of correlation in the TCS map around thePTPN6gene in both Institut Curie and TCGA cohorts (Supplementary Fig. 2a,b). We analysed the copy number alterations of HGSOC samples and classified the patients, referred to as unchanged or amplified/deleted, according to their genomic status in this specific region (Supplementary Fig. 2e). When we restricted the analysis to patients of the unchanged subgroup, the TCS peak observed around thePTPN6gene with all patients was lost in both cohorts (Supplementary Fig. 2c,d), revealing this peak was indeed because of genomic alterations. In contrast, the correlation betweenPTPN6andpri-miR-200c-141transcription was maintained in patients with no copy number alteration in this locus (unchanged subgroup;Fig. 3d). Interestingly, in this subgroup, the correlation was restricted toPTPN6, and was not observed withPHB2, the downstream gene (Fig. 3d). Accordingly, the same findings were obtained from the TCGA cohort (Fig. 3e), strengthening the validity of such data. In this cohort, mature miRNA levels were analysed, aspri-miRNA-200c-141levels were not available. It is noteworthy thatPTPN6was ranked the 13th-most correlated gene with miR-200c among the 12,044 genes tested, in the TCGA cohort. Together, these results indicate that the transcriptional co-regulation betweenPTPN6and miR-200c/141 is a relevant process for the expression of the two miRNAs in HGSOC independently of genomic alterations. To explain the tight correlation betweenpri-miR-200c-141andPTPN6primary transcripts, we considered two non-exclusive hypotheses (Supplementary Fig. 2f). In the first hypothesis, thePTPN6primary transcription bypasses its usual polyadenylation site, thereby promoting the downstream expression of miR-200c/141. In this case,miR-200c/141transcription results from either an APA ofPTPN6mRNA or a late termination ofPTPN6transcription. In the second hypothesis,pri-PTPN6andpri-miR-200c-141primary transcripts are produced from two independent but co-regulated promoters. This co-regulation could be mediated by a spatial DNA conformation, favouring shared regulation by common transcription factors and/or epigenetic marks. The two mechanisms could work together, with PTPN6 bypass favouring the transcription initiation at the miRNA locus, for example. It is worth noting that thePTPN6gene has two alternative promoters (Fig. 2a). Here, we were interested in the most 5' one, also called P1, which is the one used in almost all cell types, except haematopoietic cells, in which P2 is active53. We will refer below toPTPN6P1 promoter asPTPN6promoter. We first demonstrated the existence of a transcript, downstream of the polyadenylation site of thePTPN6gene and upstream of the miR-200c/141-coding region (schemaFig. 4a). This intermediate transcript (assessed withSet 1primers, compatible with quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) experiments) accumulated with the same kinetics asPTPN6primary transcript upon oxidative stress (Fig. 4b, left panel, andSupplementary Fig. 3a,b, left panel). As expected according to the clear correlation betweenPTPN6andpri-miR-200c-141, this intermediate transcript followed also the same kinetics aspri-miR-200c-141(Fig. 4b, right panel, andSupplementary Fig. 3b, right panel). We thus speculated that this intermediate transcript was the result of a transcriptional read-through from thePTPN6gene. In agreement with the assumption thatPTPN6read-through led to the transcription of the downstream miR-200c/141, this intermediate transcript was also correlated with thepri-miR-200c-141in HGSOC (Fig. 4c, right). Moreover, we also detected a significant correlation between the expression levels of this intermediate transcript andPTPN6primary transcript in HGSOC (Fig. 4c, left). Importantly, a read-through from thePTPN6gene was also detected in RNA-seq data generated from a set of cell lines in the ENCODE project and visualized using the UCSC Genome Browser (Supplementary Fig. 4). The levels of expression of the intermediate transcript, while being much lower than mature (exonic)PTPN6mRNA as expected, reached the same expression rate as thepri-PTPN6primary (intronic) transcript (Supplementary Fig. 4). We next demonstrated that this intermediate transcript resulted from the bypass of the usual polyadenylation site of thePTPN6gene (Fig. 4d,e). Indeed, we detected both spliced and unspliced transcripts extending fromPTPN6-coding sequence to the downstream region of its usual polyadenylation site, in both mouse and human cells at basal states and following H2O2exposure (Set 2primers,Fig. 4dandSupplementary Fig. 3c). Importantly, the same type of transcript was also detected in human HGSOC (Fig. 4d, bottom). Furthermore, we confirmed that these bypassedPTPN6transcripts reached thepri-miR-200c-141sequence both in cell lines and in HGSOC (Set 3primers,Fig. 4eandSupplementary Fig. 3d), thus showing thatPTPN6read-through could indeed reach the miR-200c/141 locus and impact directlypri-miR-200c-141expression. The products amplified using theSet 2andSet 3couples of primers were cloned and sequenced, in order to verify that they corresponded to the region located betweenPTPN63'-end andmiR-200c-1415'-end. It was noteworthy that this intermediate transcript was detected at the same levels by quantitative PCR (qPCR) by using either random hexamers or oligo dT in the reverse transcription reaction, suggesting it was polyadenylated. Consistently, using the 3' Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE) methodology, we identified APA sites reached by thepri-PTPN6/pri-miR-200c-141transcript (Supplementary Fig. 5a,b). These observations thus demonstrate that the read-through transcription from thePTPN6gene can reach themiR-200c-141encoding unit and that the levels of these transcripts are comparable. According to these results, the transcriptional co-regulation betweenPTPN6andmiR-200c-141genes can result from late termination of transcription by RNA-polymerase II or APA (hypothesis 1,Supplementary Fig. 2f). We next wondered in which proportion the read-through from thePTPN6gene participates tomiR-200c/141transcription. We quantified the expression rates of each RNA entity detected alongPTPN6andmiR-200c-141genomic locus, namely thepri-PTPN6primary transcript, the intermediate transcript (RNA detected downstreamPTPN6polyadenylation signal and upstreammiR-200c/141promoter) and thepri-miR-200c-141primary transcript, whose synthesis could result from bothPTPN6read-through and transcription from miR-specific promoter (Fig. 5a). Two experimental proceedings were adopted to quantify these weakly expressed molecules. First, nuclear RNA was used, in order to increase sensitivity of the assay. Second,pri-miR-200c-141amount was evaluated using qPCR primers located outside of a previously described expressed sequence tag (EST) (grey boxesFig. 5a). This avoided bias related to different RNA stability (when comparing EST and intronic RNA) and allowed comparison with intronicpri-PTPN6and intermediate transcript in absolute quantities. Based on standard curves obtained on serial dilutions of a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) DNA corresponding to the same genomic locus (Supplementary Fig. 6a), we first observed that the quantity of the intermediate transcript was equivalent to the level of thepri-PTPN6andpri-miR-200c-141primary transcripts in SKOV3 ovarian cancer cells at basal state (Fig. 5b). Indeed, in these cells, although the expression rate was faint, data indicated that all molecules ofpri-PTPN6primary transcript were able to bypassPTPN6polyadenylation signal (ratioIntermediate transcript/pri-PTPN6=1;Fig. 5c). Moreover, all intermediate transcripts gave rise topri-miR-200c-141primary transcripts (ratiopri-miR-200c-141/Intermediate transcript=1;Fig. 5c;see alsoFig. 9afor schematic representation of the data). Upon H2O2exposure,PTPN6transcription initiation (evaluated by thepri-PTPN6transcript quantity) increased fivefold (Fig. 5d), whereas the levels of the intermediate transcript was only induced threefold (Figs 5d,e). Indeed, only 56% ofPTPN6primary transcripts were able to bypassPTPN6polyadenylation signal, suggesting thatPTPN6read-through was reduced by oxidative stress. Still, the totality of the 56% intermediate transcript contributed topri-miR-200c-141primary transcription (ratiopri-miR-200c-141/Intermediate transcript=1) in SKOV3 following oxidative stress (Fig. 5e). Finally, we evaluated the role ofPTPN6transcription and read-through in stress-inducedpri-miR-200c-141transcription by using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology (Fig. 6). In that aim, we deleted the genomic region containing the two promoters (P1 and P2) drivingPTPN6transcription in epithelial and haematopoietic cells, respectively (Fig. 6a). We decided to avoid the use of a selection gene, which would have required the insertion of an independent promoter with the risk of an ectopic transcriptional start in thePTPN6locus. We selected two stable cell lines from parental SKOV3 cells (SKOV3-Delta1 and SKOV3-Delta2) based on PCR and qPCR genotyping (Fig. 6b-d). Genomic deletion ofPTPN6promoters reduced significantlyPTPN6upregulation by oxidative stress (Fig. 6e, left), as expected for a transcriptional-dependent regulation. Importantly, depletion ofPTPN6promoters also prevented the induction of both the intermediate transcript and thepri-miR-200c-141transcript (Fig. 6e, middle and right). These experiments demonstrate thatPTPN6transcription is required forpri-miR-200c-141upregulation upon stress. Taken as a whole, these results show that the transcriptional read-through from thePTPN6gene leads to the transcription of thepri-miR-200c-141and explains, at least in part, howPTPN6transcription could regulate miR-200c/141 levels following oxidative stress in ovarian cancer cells. As described above, we observed a strict correlation betweenPTPN6andpri-miRNA-200c-141transcription. It has been previously shown thatmiR-200c/141transcription can be initiated downstream from thePTPN6gene and regulated by an independent promoter1115373839. In addition to the read-through of thePTPN6gene, we thus next checked whether the transcription ofpri-miR-200c-141could be initiated at its closest transcriptional start site (TSS). Indeed,PTPN6bypass could reach miR-200c/141 locus but also favour transcription initiation of poised RNA Polymerase II on miRNA TSS. Using 5'RACE method, we were able to confirm the existence of a capped mRNA entity, whose 5'-extremity was compatible with previously identified EST located upstream of miR-200c (Supplementary Fig. 5a). Consistently, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments confirmed RNA polymerase II recruitment atPTPN6P1 andmiR 200c/141promoters (Supplementary Fig. 5c,d). Thus, in addition to transcripts generated through the bypass of thePTPN6polyA site,miR-200c/141expression can also be initiated at their independent promoter. As we observed a striking correlation betweenPTPN6andpri-miR-200c-141transcription, we next wondered if the two promoters could share regulatory mechanisms. By performing methylated-DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) experiments, we showed thatPTPN6- andmiR-200c/141-specific promoters were both methylated in cell lines with low expression of miR-200c/141 and demethylated in cells characterized by high-miR-200c/141 expression (Fig. 7a,b), confirming previous results404243. Accordingly, bothPTPN6andpri-miRNA-200c-141genes were upregulated upon treatment with a DNA demethylating agent, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (Supplementary Fig. 7a). As expected, thePTPN6haematopoietic promoter P2 is highly methylated in ovarian cancer cells. Moreover, the active histone methylation marks H3K9Ac and H3K4me3 enrichment were in complete agreement with DNA methylation status in all cell lines tested (Fig. 7c,d). Together, these results indicate that thePTPN6andmiR-200c/141promoters could be under equivalent epigenetic regulation. We further extended this observation to 46 non-haematopoietic cell lines of the ENCODE project, in which the methylation states ofPTPN6andmiR-200c/141promoters were correlated (Supplementary Fig. 7b). Finally, in HGSOC from the TCGA cohort, although miR-200c/141 expression levels were globally high, the methylation status of thePTPN6promoter was significantly negatively correlated with the miR-200c/141 expression levels (Supplementary Fig. 7c), highlighting the relevance of our findings not only in cultured cell lines but also in human cancers. In conclusion,PTPN6andmiR-200c/141regulatory regions exhibit similar epigenetic marks and might share epigenetic-regulatory mechanisms. We finally wondered how their promoters of thePTPN6andmiR-200c/141genes could be so finely co-regulated. We hypothesized that co-transcription of the two genes could result from a physical interaction between their promoters, thus facilitating regulation by common molecules, such as epigenetic regulators. To test this hypothesis, we performed chromosome conformation capture (3C) experiments (Fig. 8) that quantifies interaction frequency between genomic regions with high sensitivity for short-range chromatin interaction54. We first performed 3C experiments on the IGROV-1 ovarian cancer cell line expressing high levels ofPTPN6andmiR-200c/141transcripts (Fig. 8c,d; seeSupplementary Fig. 1dandSupplementary Fig. 6cfor comparative quantification ofPTPN6andmiR-200c-141primary transcripts in IGROV-1 and SKOV3 cell lines). Interestingly, we uncovered an interaction betweenPTPN6- andmiR-200c/141-specific promoters, using a primer anchor (anchor 1) located at themiR-200c/141promoter region (Fig. 8c). The DNA loop detected using the anchor 1 brings together the 5'-end sequences ofmiR-200c/141and thePTPN6promoter regions. This interaction was further validated by the use of a reciprocal primer (anchor 2) located in thePTPN6promoter (Fig. 8d). Using anchor 2, we observed thatPTPN6promoter not only interacts withmiR-200c/141promoter, but also with a large genomic locus of ?10 kilobases in length. This locus includes thePTPN63'-extremity, themiR-200c/141promoter region and a region downstream from the miRNAs that reaches the 3'-end of thePHB2gene (Fig. 8d). Thus,PTPN6gene is organized in a 3D gene-loop-like structure, which includes thePTPN6promoter and its 3'-extremity but also themiR-200c/141locus. In SKOV3 cells, characterized by low levels ofpri-PTPN6andpri-miR-200c/141transcripts, the physical interaction between the two promoters was undetectable with the primer anchor 1 (Fig. 8e). Similarly, using the primer anchor 2, the interaction frequency betweenPTPN6andmiR-141/200cpromoters was close to background (Fig. 8f). Although thePTPN6intragenic-loop (bringing togetherPTPN65'- and 3'-ends) was still detected, it did not include the large downstream region containingthe miR-200c/141gene (Fig. 8f). Moreover, although detectable, the interaction betweenPTPN65'- and 3'-ends was lower in SKOV3 than in IGROV-1 cells (Fig. 8d,f). This was expected as intragenic DNA loops have already been associated with transcriptional activity5055. Altogether, these observations suggest that high-level expression of bothPTPN6andmiR-200c/141genes is associated with the formation of a 3D DNA loop associating their respective promoters. Still, the upregulation of bothPTPN6andpri-miR-200c-141transcription by H2O2treatment in SKOV3 cells was not enough to induce a detectable change in the 3D conformation (Fig. 8g,h). Finally, we investigated whether the DNA loop observed between thePTPN6andmiR-200c/141promoters in IGROV-1 cells could favour the read-through from thePTPN6gene. To do so, we comparedPTPN6primary transcript levels with that of the intermediate transcript in IGROV-1 and SKOV3 cells upon stress (Fig. 8i,jandSupplementary Fig. 5cfor RT-negative controls). The ratio between intermediate transcript andPTPN6primary transcript levels was of 1 in IGROV-1 cell line, whereas of 0.56 in SKOV3 upon stress, indicating that the DNA loop is associated with increased read-through (Fig. 8j). In both SKOV3 and IGROV-1 cells, the levels of the different transcripts detected along the intermediate region and thepri-miR-200c-141genomic locus were equivalent among them (Fig. 8i). This means that independently ofPTPN6transcription initiation rate and percentage of bypass, each molecule of thePTPN6bypassed transcript corresponds to one molecule ofpri-miR-200c-141primary transcript, indicating a major role of the read-through. We also analysed the different quantities of thepri-miR-200c-141primary transcript (intronic isoform) with this one of the exonic isoform, corresponding to previously describedESTs(referred to aspri-miR(EST),seeFig. 5afor genomic localization). Globally, the quantity detected ofpri-miR(EST)was at least tenfold higher thanpri-miR-200c-141primary transcript (intronic isoform), most probably becausepri-miR(EST)is stabilized and/or submitted to additive regulation. Here again, we observed that the differential expression between the two cell lines was maintained and 2.4-times higher in IGROV-1 than in SKOV3+H2O2cells (Fig. 8k). Taken as a whole, our work shows that the 3D DNA loop linkingPTPN6-andmiR-200c/141-specific promoters contributes, with the transcriptional bypass of thePTPN6polyadenylation site, to the fine co-regulation of these two transcript units (Fig. 9). We provide here evidence that intergenic miRNAs can be regulated through a transcriptional read-through and a 3D chromatin interaction between different promoters. The miR-200 family members exhibit key roles in oxidative stress response and ovarian tumorigenesis, oxidative stress being also an important feature of HGSOC245791032. Understanding the mechanisms involved in their regulation is an important question to highlight new insights of their functions in these patho-physiological conditions, especially in the characterization of ovarian cancer molecular subgroups. Here, we demonstrate that the transcription rate of themiR-200c/141transcription unit is a crucial step in determining mature miRNAs levels within cells, both at basal state and upon stress. Moreover, we unravel two original and complementary mechanisms by which the transcription ofmiR-200c/141is regulated: a transcriptional read-through of an upstream gene,PTPN6,and a transcription co-regulation mediated through a 3D DNA loop linking the two closely locatedPTPN6andmiR-200c/141promoters. Data from the last decade demonstrated that chromatin conformation is not randomly determined and has important roles in gene regulation. Studies in yeast have shown that DNA loops linking promoter and terminator regions of the same gene are important for transcriptional memory and directionality56. Examples of such 3D DNA conformation have also been described in humans and were associated with transcriptional repression565758. Our data uncover a new example of such short-range chromatin interaction in human cells that can participate in miRNA regulation. Indeed, we highlight here a chromatin interaction that brings close together the promoters ofPTPN6andmiR-200c/141genes. Importantly, the chromatin loop we discovered between these two transcription units (PTPN6andmiR-200c/141) does not correspond to the gene-loops previously described between the promoter and terminator regions within the same gene585960. In contrast to these intragenic DNA loops, the chromatin loop we uncovered extends from thePTPN6promoter to a region far downstream of thePTPN63'-end, reaching the miR-200c/141 promoter and spanning at least 10 kilobases. Interestingly, we also detected that the promoter region of theATN1-encoding gene, located upstreamPTPN6may also interact withPTPN6and be another partner in the fine regulation of this genomic locus. The interaction between 5'-end ofPTPN6andmiRpromoter could facilitate the RNA polymerase II recycling from thePTPN63'-end to its start site, as well as from thepri-miR-200c-1413'-end to thePTPN6start site. Given the strict correlation of transcription between these two genes, we propose that the physical association of the two promoters plays a positive role in their co-regulation. Consistent with this idea, the formation of this 3D DNA loop is linked to the expression rates of the two genes and the proportion of read-through from thePTPN6gene. Although the 3D DNA structure is formed in cells with high basal levels of expression of the two genes, it remains undetected in cells with a low basal expression rate. Accordingly, the levels of DNA methylation and active histone marks, such as H3K9Ac and H3K4me3, are tightly equivalent betweenPTPN6and miR-200c/141 promoters. Some of the epigenetic silencing marks could be reversible and removed by oxidative stress. Our results are in agreement with previous studies showing that in breast, lung, colon, bladder and prostate cancer cells, miR-200c/141 levels are consistent with DNA methylation status and histone modifications detected in their promoter regions. We confirmed these results in ovarian cancer cells and extended them to the promoter of the upstream and co-regulated gene,PTPN6. Finally, we demonstrate here that the 3D DNA loop is associated with a 2.5-fold increase in transcription read-through from the upstream gene,PTPN6. It is important to note that given the physical interaction between the two promoters that we demonstrated here, the crosslink between the promoters could also contribute to the ChIP experiments results. Nevertheless, our results are consistent with the fact that both genes could be under equivalent epigenetic regulation, which is in complete agreement with the coordinated epigenetic and transcriptional regulation of these genes. In addition to the DNA loop, our data unravel the read-through from thePTPN6gene, as another original mechanism linkingPTPN6andmiR-200c/141genes. Indeed, we demonstrate the existence of an intermediate transcript extending from the 3'-end of thePTPN6gene to themiR-200c/141transcription unit. It is mediated through the transcriptional bypass of the usualPTPN6polyA site, allowing the RNA polymerase II to reach the downstreammiR-200c/141transcription unit. We identified two downstream APA sites used for the termination of thepri-miR-200c-141primary transcript. The first corresponds to the already established ESTs, located downstream of the miR-200c/141 genomic sequences. The second APA site, located very close to thePHB2polyadenylation signal, is conserved between human and mouse species and had not been reported previously (Supplementary Fig. 5). One should note, however, that the polyadenylation of thePTPN6transcripts at these APA sites is not necessarily required for the production of the miRNAs in the same round ofPTPN6transcription. Indeed, miRNAs can be processed by Drosha co-transcriptionally and a late termination of RNA Pol II polymerization downstream from thePTPN63'-end can be sufficient for the transcription of the downstream miR-200c/141, even whenPTPN6mRNA is polyadenylated at its usual site. Such regulation of intergenic miRNAs through upstream transcription has been postulated by Proudfoot and colleagues61. We give here, for the first time, evidence of this type of miRNA transcription. We have investigated to which extent each of these two mechanisms (DNA loop versusPTPN6read-through) contributes tomiR-200c/141primary transcription. Thepri-miR-200c-141levels being the result of bothPTPN6read-through and independent transcription initiation, we have carefully assessed the quantity of the different primary transcripts detected alongPTPN6andmiR-200c/141genomic locus. We observed that the read-through from thePTPN6gene is a dominant mechanism in ovarian cancer cells, each molecule of thepri-miR-200c-141primary transcript corresponding to one molecule of bypassedPTPN6polyadenylation signal. Thus, the transcriptionalPTPN6read-through could be the major mechanism explaining the strikingly similar kinetics ofPTPN6andpri-miR-200c-141upregulation following stress. Ideally, to demonstrate the impact of thePTPN6gene onpri-miR-200c-141transcription, a homozygous genetic knock-out model of thePTPN6gene would be required to definitely prove the role ofPTPN6transcription onmiR-200c/141regulation. A natural mutated mouse model forPtpn6exists, the motheaten mice, but as thePtpn6transcription is not impaired in these mice, they are not appropriate to investigate this question. We have thus evaluated if the read-through from thePTPN6gene can influencemiR-200c-141transcription, by using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Deletion ofPTPN6promoter demonstrated thatPTPN6transcription is required formiR-200c-141primary transcription in SKOV3 cells. Unfortunately,PTPN6silencing is deleterious for the survival of IGROV-1 cells, characterized by high basalPTPN6expression rate. Being detected in cells with high expression levels, we can speculate that the 3D chromatin structure and subsequent high interaction frequency between the two promoters favours the co-regulated transcription of the two genes. The read-through molecule can reach the miRNAs locus, as demonstrated previously, or also favour the start of the polymerization from the miR-200c/141 TSS. In contrast, in cell lines that exhibit low basal expression rate ofPTPN6andmiR-200c/141, such as SKOV3, the interaction frequency between the two promoters is low. Interestingly, our data suggest also that the 3D DNA loop is not only associated with a high rate of transcription initiation but also of read-through from thePTPN6gene. The so finely regulated co-expression ofPTPN6andmiR-200c/141suggest a functional relationship between the two genes. The levels of the miR-200 family members are reproducibly upregulated upon oxidative stress conditions in various cell lines and participate in stress response. Interestingly, the co-regulated genePTPN6encodes for a Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase that is itself implicated in anti-oxidant defense62. Importantly, in HGSOC, the oxidative stress signature has a prognostic value and the miR-200s are significantly upregulated, as shown by several independent studies245732. In that sense, our data on the mechanism of their regulation give another additive insight into the different ovarian transcriptomic subgroups defined by the miR-200/141. In complete agreement with our results,PTPN6is also generally overexpressed in ovarian cancer cells and in HGSOC636465. PTPN6 and miR-200s play a physiological role in oxidative stress regulation and interestingly, they have both a negative impact on the p38 pathway. Indeed, in cells depleted forPTPN6, the levels of phosphorylated p38 are increased66. The activation of this key redox sensor that is also directly targeted by miR-14/200a (ref. 7) is rescued by a treatment with an antioxidant66. Finally, the 3C experiment also revealed that the promoter of theATN1gene, located upstreamPTPN6, could interact withPTPN65'-end. As ATN1 is involved in OXPHOS regulation and mitochondrial disorders67, this observation may represent interesting new clues for the global regulation of this genomic locus by oxidative stress, and for its role in this process. These results are complementary to previous studies68showing a reciprocal interaction between miRNA and their regulatory transcription factor. Indeed, one of the largest known mammalian miRNA-containing cluster, Gtl2-Dio3, is regulated by MEF2A, a key transcription factor involved in skeletal muscle. Reciprocally, these miRNA directly target the secreted Fizzled-related protein 2, an inhibitor of the wingless-type (WNT) pathway. These observations are similar to our own findings showing the co-regulation ofPTPN6andmiR-200c/141by oxidative stress, the two exerting a role in oxidative stress response. Altogether, these data give complementary insights of the interplay between miRNA, their regulatory elements and the processes in which they are involved. The kind of transcriptional regulation we describe here are probably not restricted to these miRNAs and other examples of such mechanisms are likely to be discovered in the future. All cells lines were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen, # 41966) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (except for immortalized mouse fibroblasts, which were maintained in 7% fetal bovine serum) at 37 degrees C and 5% CO2atmosphere. Cells were treated with hydrogen peroxide, H2O2(400 muM), except WI38 treated with 200 muM H2O2, for different periods of time, as indicated on each figure (up to 8 h). H2O2was purchased from Sigma (#H-1009) and dilutions in H2O were prepared just before use. Mouse fibroblast cells were submitted for 3 h to various stresses increasing ROS levels: 50 muM menadine sodium bisulfite (Sigma, #M2518), 200 muM Arsenic (Sigma, #35000), 300 mM Sorbitol (Sigma, #85529). To inhibit transcription, cells were treated with 5 muM actinomycin D (Sigma, #A9415) during 4 h. The DNA-demethylating agent 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (Sigma, #A3656) was diluted in dimethylsulphoxide and added to the cells at a final concentration of 10 muM. Medium was changed after 48 h and cells were treated for 96 h before lysis. Total RNA isolation was performed using miRNEasy Kit from (Qiagen, #217004) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA concentrations were determined with a NanoDrop apparatus (NanoDrop Technologies, Inc.), and RNA integrity was verified using Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit (Agilent, #5067-1511) and apparatus. Before complementary DNA synthesis, RNA were treated with DNaseI, RNase free (Thermo Scientific, #EN0525) in reaction buffer with MgCl2according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were resuspended in nuclear extraction buffer (Tris 10 mM pH 7.5; 10 mM NaCl; 5 mM MgCl2; 0.5% NP-40), incubated at 4 degrees C for 5 min and spin down 5 min at 500g. The cytosolic fraction was discarded. The pellet, corresponding to the nuclear fraction, was washed twice in the nuclear extraction buffer, resuspended in Trizol and passed through a 20-G needle five times. RNA extraction was done with mi-RNeasy kit (QIAGEN #217004) and RNA concentrations were determined with a NanoDrop apparatus (NanoDrop Technologies, Inc.). Before cDNA synthesis, nuclear RNA were treated with DNaseI, RNase free (Thermo Scientific #EN0525) in reaction buffer with MgCl2according to the manufacturer's protocol. Primary transcripts and mRNAs levels were assessed using SYBR qRT-PCR assay. Reverse transcriptase reactions were performed using 1 mug of DNAse-treated total RNA per sample and iScript RT Kit (Bio-Rad, #170-8897) or SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase with oligo(dT) and random primers (Invitrogen, #180 80-051). SYBR Power master mix (Applied Biosystems, #4367659) was used for qPCR with primers at 300 nM final concentration each. GAPDH, U6 snRNAandCYCLOPHYLIN Bwere used as loading controls. TaqMan qRT-PCR assay was used for detection of mature miRNAs. Reagents, primers and probes were obtained from Applied Biosystems. RT reactions and real-time qPCR were performed according to manufacturer protocols from 50 ng of RNA per sample. Primers and probes are specific for each miRNA and are designed by the manufacturer. U6 snRNA and miR-16 were used as loading controls. qPCR reactions were performed in a Chromo4 apparatus (Bio-Rad). Relative expression was calculated using the comparative cycle threshold method (2DeltaDeltaCt) and the Opticom Monitor 3 software. qPCR primers were designed using PrimerQuest (Integrated DNA Technologies) and were purchased from Sigma. The efficiency of each couple of primer used for qPCR was verified using serial dilutions of the template. When comparing transcript levels between different couples of primers, normalization using standard DNA was performed. Normalization was done using control DNA template obtained from the RP11-8J11 BAC clone (bacpac.chori.org), containingPTPN6and miR-200c/141 genomic region. For each primer pair, quantification was performed using the coefficients from the standard curve calculated using the control template dilutions measured in the same qPCR plate. Schematic representation of the genomic positions of the primers is indicated inFig. 5aand sequences are given inSupplementary Table 2. RT-PCR reactions usingSet 2andSet 3primers were performed on cDNA from cells and HGSOC using Phusion DNA Polymerase (Thermo Scientific, # F-530) according to the manufacturer's instructions and with the GC buffer. During the first ten cycles of the PCR reactions, the annealing temperature increased 0.5 degrees C every cycle, from 60 degrees to 65 degrees C and was maintained at 65 degrees C for the following cycles. The reactions were stopped after either 25, 30, 35 or 40 cycles. The PCR products were loaded on 0.8% agarose gel then transferred onto Hybond N+ membrane (GE Healthcare, # RPN203B). Membranes were hybridized with gamma-ATP32P-labelled primers (5'-TGACCCTGTATATAGCCCAGCCA-3' and 5'-AGCAAACAAAGCCTGGGAGAGAGA-3') in ULTRAhyb Ultrasensitive Hybridization Buffer (Ambion, # AM8669). Signals were detected with Typhoon and quantified with Multi Gauge software. All primer sequences used for PCR and qPCR are given inSupplementary Table 2. Amplified bands were purified, cloned in TA-vector (Invitrogen#45.0030) and submitted to sequencing in order to verify that they corresponded to the expected intermediate transcript sequence. Target-specific CRISPR guide RNAs (sgRNA) were designed by GeneCoppeia to have limited off-targets. Corresponding primers were subcloned into the All-in-one sgRNA plasmid (GeneCopoeia, #CS-HCP000300-2-CG01-1-LR). The sequences flankingPTPN6promoter region targeted by the CRISPR guide RNAs are: sgRNA1: 5'-GATAACGCCTGCAACGACAT-3'; sgRNA2: 5'-GCCTGCCACCCACGGTAGAC-3'. Twenty-four hours before transfection, 5 * 105SKOV3 cells were seeded into six-well plates. Cells were transfected using Cell Avalanche Transfection Reagent (EZ-Biosystems #EZT-IGRO-1), provided by the company for enhancing transfection efficiency in IGROV-1 Ovarian cancer cells, but which also improved significantly the transfection efficiency in SKOV3 cell line. Three micrograms of sgRNA-recombined vector (containing the sgRNA1 and sgRNA2) were transfected using the manufacturer's protocol. Twenty-four hours post transfection, the cells were transiently selected (for 24 h) with hygromycine B Gold (InvivoGen, #ant-hg-1) in order to eliminate non-transfected cells. Transfection protocol was repeated four times on total cell populations. Sixty-three individual clones were next isolated by limited dilution and analysed at genomic level. PCR- and qPCR-based genotyping methods were used to identify the clones in which the genomic deletion occurs and to quantify the DNA copy number of the targeted region relative to control regions, measuring the efficiency of CRISPR deletion as creating allelic deletions, SKOV3 cells being tetraploid. Sequences of the primers used for the genotyping were designed either inside or outside the targeted region, as schematically represented inFig. 6a. Sequences of the primers are given inSupplementary Table 2. Genomic DNA of the 60 individual clones was purified with DNAeasy blood and tissue kit (Qiagen, #69504) using the manufacturer's instructions. qPCR was performed with 50 ng of genomic DNA in duplicate using SYBR green master mix (Roche) on a Chromo4 apparatus (Bio-Rad). Relative levels of DNA copy number were calculated using the 2DeltaDeltaCtmethod with copy number normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) intron 1 (chromosome 12) as a control. Two individual clones exhibited a significant reduction of DNA copy number in the targeted region, with two- and three-recombined alleles among four, respectively. To obtain complete deletion of the four alleles, these two individual clones were submitted to two additive rounds of transfections and re-analysed at genomic level, using the same PCR- and qPCR-based genotyping method, as described above. Two clones referred to as SKOV3-Delta1 and SKOV3-Delta2 exhibited tetra-allelic recombination and deletion of the PTPN6 promoter-targeted region and were considered for further analyses. The amplified fragments from genotyping PCR and qPCR have been isolated, cloned and sequenced to verify that they correspond to the recombinedPTPN6genomic locus after deletion. The Institut Curie cohort is described in ref. 7. Analyses based on the Curie cohort were approved by the Institutional Review Board and Ethics committee. Before inclusion in the study, patients were informed that their biological samples could be used for research purposes and that they had the right to refuse if they wished so. Analysis of tumour samples was performed according to the relevant national law on the protection of people taking part in biomedical research. Only samples enriched in at least 65-70% epithelial cells have been considered in our study. miRNA and mRNA levels were assessed by qPCR using TaqMan and SYBR assays as described in ref. 7. Microarray data are accessible in the Gene Expression Omibus under the accession number GSE26193. All the data from the TCGA cohort was obtained from the TCGA Data Portal (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/). Patient characteristics and clinical features of the two cohorts analysed in our study are listed inSupplementary Table 1, in order to facilitate their comparison. TCGA data are provided from tumour samples with at least 60% of enrichment in epithelial tumour cells, as mentioned in theSupplementary Informationin ref. 51. For the Curie cohort, SNP 100K data were analysed using Partek Software. Raw data were imported into Partek using default parameters and the Partek baseline for copy number calculation, followed by a GC-adjustment. The segmentation parameters used were 15 markers, a signal-to-noise ratio of 0.3 and aP-value of 0.001. The threshold used for defining amplified/deleted patients in thePTPN6andmiR-200c/141region was +/-0.3. For the TCGA cohort, copy number data were downloaded from:https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/(Level 3 data, MSKCC 1x1M-G447A). Data were imported and analysed using R version 2.12.2. Segments defined in TCGA data were used to classify unchanged, amplified or deleted patients in the region of interest. The classification was made according to segment mean values in a window of 150 kb in the chromosome 12p13 includingPTPN6andmiR-200c/141. Patients were considered as 'Amplified' or 'Deleted', if any segment mean value in this region was above +0.3 or below -0.3, respectively. 'Unchanged' patients were those who exhibit neither amplifications nor deletions in the region of interest, according to this threshold. TCS were computed as described in ref. 52. Briefly, from the microarray data, a list containing only one probeset per gene is made. Next, for each gene, the TCS is computed as the sum of the correlation coefficients (Spearman's rho coefficient) between the gene and its 2n neighbours (n=10). To define a significance threshold (P=0.001), TCS were computed using randomized positions for probesets and the TCS of the 1,000th quantile was used. For the TCS Maps, TCS values of each gene are plotted against the corresponding genomic position. For the NCI-60 panel, Agilent microarray data were obtained from CellMiner Database (http://discover.nci.nih.gov/cellminer/loadDownload.do) and miRNA qPCR data were obtained from the Israel labhttp://dtp.nci.nih.gov/mtargets/download.html. For the Sanger Cell Line Project panel, microarray data were obtained from the Broad Institute website (http://www.broadinstitute.org/cgi-bin/cancer/publications/pub_paper.cgi?mode=view paper_id=189). Affymetrix Plus 2.0 probeset 206687_s_at was used for PTPN6 levels. All the non-haematopoietic cell lines were included in the analyses. MeDIP experiments were performed using MagMEDIP kit from Diagenode (#C02010020), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, genomic DNA was extracted from 3 to 10 million cells and sonicated using the Bioruptor apparatus (Diagenode) to obtain fragments of 100-600 bp in length (10 min at 'low' power with cycles of 15 s ON and 15 s OFF). For each reaction, 1 mug DNA was used. Positive (methylated DNA) and negative (unmethylated DNA) controls were added to the reaction, in order to normalize for the immunoprecipitation (IP) efficiency. IP using anti-5-methylcytosine antibody and magnetic beads was performed overnight at 4 degrees C. After washing and elution, immunoprecipitated DNA was measured by qPCR and reported to input DNA. Cells were crosslinked for 15 min using formaldehyde (1% final concentration) (Sigma, #F8775) at room temperature. Next, they were harvested and nuclei were extracted, lysed and sonicated. IP was performed using magnetic beads (Invitrogen, #100-02D) and 5 mug of antibody for each condition. Anti-RNA Polymerase II antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz (sc-899) and histone antibodies were purchased from Abcam: H3K4me3 (ab8580), H3K9Ac (ab10812), H3 (ab1791). After reverse crosslink, ChIP enriched fragments were evaluated by qPCR and reported to input DNA levels. 3C experiments were performed based on protocols previously established69with modifications. Fifty million cells were crosslinked with 2% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature and lysed in the following buffer: 10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0; 10 mM NaCl; Igepal (NP-40), 0.2% (v/v) containing protease inhibitors. DNA was digested overnight with the restriction enzymeNcoI (New England BioLabs) in a buffer containing final concentration of 1% Triton X-100 and 0.1% SDS. The restriction enzyme was chosen in order to investigate the short-range chromatin interaction with a high-resolution capacity in our region of interest. Ligation in diluted conditions (total of 80 ml) was performed at 16 degrees C for 4 h followed by 30 min at room temperature using T4 ligase from Promega (# M1794). After overnight reverse crosslink at 65 degrees C with proteinase K (Roche, #03 115 836 001), DNA was extracted with phenol and chloroform and precipitated in ethanol. RNAse (Roche, #11 119 915 001) treatment was performed followed by supplementary phenol chloroform extractions and ethanol precipitation. For each experiment, purity of 3C template was assessed as described in ref. 69. Restriction efficiency at eachNcoI site was calculated from non-ligated controls and was of 60-70% in average. Primer normalization was done using control template obtained from digestion and ligation of the RP11-8J11 BAC clone (bacpac.chori.org). For each primer pair, quantification was performed using the coefficients from the standard curve calculated using the control template dilutions measured in the same qPCR plate. For each fragment, a relative interaction frequency over the first 3' fragment from the anchor was computed (by dividing the interaction frequency of a given fragment to this one of the closest 3'-fragment from the anchor) and plotted according to its distance to the anchor. All primers and modified probes were purchased from MGW Operon. Primer and anchor (probes) sequences are given inSupplementary Table 3. RACE experiments were performed using the RLM-RACE kit from Ambion (#AM 1700) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The 5' RACE protocol is designed to detect only capped mRNA. Primers used for RACE experiments are listed inSupplementary Table 2. 2 * 105SKOV3 and IGROV-1 cells were transfected the day after seeding with 10 nM of each siRNA using Dharmafect 1 transfection reagent (Dharmacon, T-2001) according to the supplier's recommendations. Forty-eight hours post transfection, SKOV3 cells were either untreated or treated with 400 muM H2O2for 1 h before RNA extraction and purification using miRNeasy kit from Qiagen. mRNA levels were measured using SYBR RT-qPCR (see above) with specific primers. GAPDH was used for internal control of mRNA quantity. SKOV3 cells areTP53null and no expression of ZEB2 was detected in IGROV-1 cell line, thus SKOV3 and IGROV-1 were not silenced usingTP53-andZEB2-specific siRNA, respectively. siRNA used for transfection were: siZEB1 (smart pool from Dharmacon #L-006564); siZEB2 (smart pool from Dharmacon #L-006914); siTP53 (smart pool from Dharmacon #L-003329) and siCtl (Control; Dharmacon #D-001810-01). Primer sequences used for qPCR are given inSupplementary Table 2. Data are generally reported as means+/-s.e.m. (or s.d. when specified), obtained from at least three independent experiments, using adapted statistical test, as mentioned. Correlation coefficients are indicated byrho(rho) and correspond to Spearman's rank correlation coefficients.
