The potential and current distributions within quantum Hall samples are important aspects of the integer quantum Hall effect [1-3]. In this effect the Hall resistance,RH, of theith plateau of a fully quantized two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) has the valueRH(i)=h/(e2i), wherehis the Planck constant,eis the elementary charge, andiis an integer. Early attempts to measure potential distributions across samples [4-7] used electrical contacts to the two-dimensional gas that were placed within the sample interior. The potentials were found to vary throughout the entire sample. There was concern, however, that the electrical contacts themselves significantly altered the potential distributions. Fontein et al. [8] have made contactless measurements of potential distributions using a laser beam and the electro-optic Pockels effect. They observed major fractions of the quantum Hall voltage occurring near the sides of the sample, but also significant contributions within the interior. Valid predictions of the potential distribution across quantum Hall samples should agree with their results. In this paper we calculate the potential distributions across the sample for applied currentsISDbetween 0 muA and 225 muA by: (a) assuming a parabolic confining potential for the charge carriers and using parameters of the parabola obtained experimentally by Choi, Tsui, and Alavi [9]; (b) assuming an applied current-induced logarithmic charge-redistribution potential for the charge carriers that is similar to that of Balaban, Meirav, and Shtrikman [10], but with very different cut-off values for the spatial extent of the potential; (c) assuming that the width of the conducting region varies with applied current because a Lorentz force deflects the conducting electrons slightly towards one side of the sample; (d) using the maximum electric field deduced by Cage and Lavine [11] from a breakdown experiment at high currents to determine the cut-off value for the spatial extent on one side of the sample; and (e) using the quantum Hall voltage to determine the cut-off value of the spatial extent on the other side of the sample. The calculated potential distributions are in excellent agreement with the measurements of Fontein et al. [8]. The coordinate system is shown inFig. 1. For convenience in writing the equations, the origin is located at the source S and is halfway across the sample widthw.The sample labeling is chosen to be consistent with previous work [11]. Potential probes 1 and 2, and the drain D, are not shown. The positivexaxis points along the sample in the general direction of the externally applied currentISD. The positiveyaxis is chosen as indicated. Therefore the positivezaxis points downward for a right-handed coordinate system. The magnetic fieldBalso points downward, simply to be consistent with results from the breakdown experiment [11] that will be used in Secs. 4 and 5. Note that the conducting charges areelectronswith chargeq= -e. This is taken into account throughout the paper; it is necessary to do so because the signs of both the confining potential and the charge-redistribution potential depend on the sign of the charge carriers. The Lorentz forceNoneL=eNone*Noneis in the positiveydirection. This force deflects the electrons slightly to the right until it is matched by the Coulomb repulsive forceNoneC= -eNone[12]. A charge-redistribution of the 2DEG results from this deflection. Also because of the Lorentz and Coulomb forces, the electrons enter the corner of the source aty= -w/2 for this magnetic field direction and exit at the corner +w/2 of the drain-in agreement with the experiment of Klass et al. [13]. We assume that the electrons spread out across the sample interior in agreement with the experiment of Fontein et al. [8]. Potential probes 4 and 6 are near the potential of the source. Probes 3 and 5 are near the potential of the drain, and have a positive potential relative to the source for these current and magnetic field directions. The chemical potentialphiA=VAis therefore positive relative to the chemical potentialphiB=VBon the opposite side of the sample. We begin the calculations with a confining potential to prevent the 2DEG from spilling out the sides of samples. Choi, Tsui, and Alavi [9] performed an experiment on mesa-etched GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure samples in zero magnetic field. They then used one-dimensional localization theory to deduce the charge-depletion widths,None, of the confining potentials, and found thatNonewas (0.5 +/- 0.2) mum for a 2DEG of surface number densityns=i(eB/h) = 1.5 * 1011/cm2. We will use their results to define the depletion width of the confining potential for a mesa-etched sample. Figure 2(a)shows a schematic of the charge distribution in the GaAs/AlGaAs interface region near one side of the mesa when there is no applied magnetic field. The GaAs layer of our sample [11] has a residual donor density of about 1 * 1014/cm3, while the donor concentration in the AlGaAs layer is about 1 * 1018/cm3andns= 5.94 * 1011/cm2. There is an ionized donor atom in the AlGaAs layer for every electron in the 2DEG but, unlike Choi, Tsui, and Alavi [9], we assume the ionized donor atoms are distributed over a volume rather than in a surface sheet with densityns. The confining potential is generated from electron surface charges on the side of the mesa, as indicated in the figure. There is an ionized donor atom or ionized impurity site in the charge-depletion region for every surface charge. We assume a homogeneous charge-depletion region inFig. 2(b). The depletion widthNonefor a homogeneous three-dimensional material is [14]NoneNonewhereNones=None0is the dielectric permittivity of the semiconductor,Noneis the dielectric constant (None= 13.1 for GaAs),None0is the permittivity of vacuum,Vmis the value of the confining potential at +/-w/2 andNDis the average density of ionized donors and impurity sites in the charge-depletion region. We selected the value of the charge-depletion width to beNone= 0.5 mum [15]. This value is consistent with the results of Choi, Tsui, and Alavi [9]. We chose the value ofVmto be one-half the 1.50 V separation between the valence and conduction bands of GaAs at 1 K [14], orVm= 0.75 V. The value of the average charge-depletion density fromEq. (1)is thusND= 4.3 * 1015/cm3, which seems quite reasonable. A homogeneous charge-depletion region results in a parabolic confining potentialVc, with the origin aty = lambda = w/2-None, as indicated schematically inFig. 2(c). The confining potential isnegativebecause the charges on the side of the mesa are electrons.

Since there is no applied current, and therefore no Hall voltage, the Fermi energyNoneFis constant across the sample width and is located halfway between Landau levels. Under these conditions, states of the lowest (N= 0) Landau level are occupied up to the Fermi energyNoneF=homegac/2, no states are occupied in the second (N= 1) Landau level,omegac=eB/m* is the cyclotron angular frequency,m* is the reduced mass of the electron (0.068 times the free electron mass in GaAs), andhh/2pi. References [11,16-18] describe how these states can be defined in the Landau gauge. Figure 3shows a schematic drawing of the energy of the confining potential forISD= 0 muA, with greatly exaggerated values ofNoneandhomegac, and only a small fraction of allowed states. The occupied/unoccupied states are indicated as solid/open circles, and the occupied (filled) states lie betweenymaxandymin= -ymax. In the presence of the magnetic field, electrons of the 2DEG occupy Landau level states that penetrate into the charge-depletion regions near the mesa edge, and current circulates around the sample periphery.

Section 2 noted that the Lorentz force exerted on the conducting electrons causes deviations -edeltasigma(y) from the average surface charge density -esigmaave= -ens= -ie2B/hof the 2DEG charge-redistribution across the sample width. The resulting charge-redistribution potential,Vr(y), arising from applied currents would be a linear function ofyif the mobile electrons occupied a three-dimensional volume. They occupy a two-dimensional sheet, however, and MacDonald, Rice, and Brinkman [19] expressed this charge-redistribution self-consistently in terms of a charge-redistribution potential asNoneNonewhereNoneNoneas shown inAppendix A. Riess [20] extended this potential to a 2DEG with finite thickness. Thouless [21] then found an analytic logarithmic approximation of this potential far from the sample sides, and Beenakker and van Houten [22] then approximated the near-edge behavior by introducing a cut-off at a distancexifrom the sample side, and a linear extrapolation forNoneNonefrom |y| =w/2 -xito |y| =w/2. The characteristic lengthxiisNone, wherelNone= (h/eB)1/2is the magnetic length anda* = 4pikappaepsilon0h2/m*e2is the effective Bohr radius in SI units. Our values of xi,lB, anda*for thei= 2 plateau at 12.3 T are 3.3 nm, 7.3 nm, and 10.2 nm, respectively. Balaban, Meirav, and Shtrikman [10] used a nonlinear (quadratic) extrapolation near the sample sides and obtained the charge-redistribution potentialNoneNonefor |y| less than w/2 -delta, wheredelta=lNonefor thei= 2 plateau, anddeltais not the differentialdeltaofEq. (10). They successfully used this potential to describe the sample-width dependence for breakdown at small currents, but could not account for the larger breakdown currents observed in other experiments [11,23-28]. Their geometry factor isNoneNonefor our values ofxianddeltaatw= 400 mum. The charge-redistribution potential described byEq. (13)was calculated for an infinite square-well confining potential, and must be modified for use with a more realistic confining potential. To do this correctly would require a numerical solution ofEq. (12), with the confining potential included, as is discussed inAppendix A. We approximated this numerical solution (and then tested the approximation) by using the form of the potential inEq. (13)but introducing two parameters,yminandymax, that alter the charge-redistribution potential due to the presence of the quadratic confining potential. It was necessary to do this because the potential distribution ofEq. (13), with a cut-off distancedelta=lNone, gave the correct quantum Hall voltageVH=RHISDacross the sample, but the electric fieldEr= -? Vrdid not increase quickly enough for increasing current to satisfy theISD= 0 muA conditions of Sec. 3.3 and then reach the electric field values necessary for quasi-elastic inter-Landau level scattering (QUILLS) transitions [11,16-18,25-28] at high currents. We use the same form for the charge-redistribution potential as Balaban et al. [10], but with a different geometrical factor and very different cut-off values,yminandymax, which vary with applied current. Our charge-redistribution potential isNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneIc(rhs) andIc(lhs) are defined byEqs. (5)and(6), and the geometry factorGinEq.

Appendix Bdiscusses the agreement between ourEq. (15)and the self-consistentEqs. (10)and(11). The electric fieldEr= -?

Figure 4shows the confining potential -Vc(y) and the charge-redistribution potential -Vr(y) across the sample for greatly exaggerated values ofNone,deltamax, anddeltamin, and for an arbitrary value ofIr, whereIris defined byEq. (16). Vrbecomes infinite at +/-w/2, but that is of no concern because it is only theoccupied stateswhich contribute to the Hall voltage, and those states occur only betweenymaxandymin. The potentials are therefore finite and well-behaved in the region of interest. Of course the electrical transport properties depend on thetotalpotentialVt(y), but we can unambiguously separateVt(y) into the confining and charge-redistribution potential componentsNoneNoneWe have uniquely defined the potentialsVc(y) andVr(y) inEqs. (2)and(3)of Sec. 3.2 andEqs. (15)to(18)in Sec. 4.1, plusEqs. (5)and(6)in Sec. 3.3. The current-independent parameters for the confining potential and the charge-redistribution potential are:None= 0.5 mum,Vm= 0.75 V, andG= 0.147. For a given sample we know the applied currentISDand the sample widthw, but there are still two free parameters:ymaxandymin. Ordinarily, it would not be possible to uniquely determine the values ofymaxandyminsince the only other piece of information is that the quantum Hall voltageVHisNoneNoneand there is a range of values forymaxthat satisfies this equation. Itispossible, however, to determine the value ofymaxfor a particular type of experiment, and we believe that the results are representative of most other experiments since our calculations agree with the experimental data of Fontein et al. [8]. We first note thatE(y) = -NoneV(y). ThereforeNoneNoneIn an experiment described in Ref. [11] we measured the quantized longitudinal voltage drops along a GaAs/AlGaAs sample between potential probes 4 and 6 ofFig. 1at high currents, and deduced the maximum electric fieldEmaxfrom a quasi-elastic inter-Landau level scattering model. The results wereNoneNoneandNoneNoneThe valueEmax= 1.1*106V/m atISD= 215 muA was just sufficient to excite the lowest,M= 1, QUILLS transitions [11,25-28]. It is clear fromFig. 4thatEmaxwill occur atymax, soNoneNoneWe can therefore useEqs. (23)and(24)to determineymax, and thenEq. (22)to obtainyminfor the sample of Ref. [11]. Note that changing the values ofymaxandyminalso alters the values ofIc(rhs),Ic(lhs), and thereby the value ofIrinEqs. (5),(6), and(16). Thus there areno free parameters, and one can obtain unique solutions to the total potential and other transport properties. Relevant values for the solution atISD= 0 muA are shown inTable 1. Most were calculated in Sec. 3.3; the remainder were found fromEqs. (2),(3), and(15)to(22). Note thatymaxandyminare predicted to be about 60 magnetic lengths from the sides of the sample. We calculate the values shown inTable 1atISD= 215 muA by increasing the value ofymaxuntilEt(ymax) = 1.1*106V/m, adjusting the value ofyminto obtain the correct Hall voltage, and remembering that changing the values ofymaxandyminalso changes the values ofIc(rhs),Ic(lhs), andIr. The solution is unique, with no free parameters. The same procedure is done atISD= 225 muA, except that the value ofymaxis increased untilEt(ymax) = 4.2*106V/m. Note inTable 1thatymaxis still about 13 magnetic lengths away from the side of the sample atISD= 225 muA. We also calculate the relevant quantities atISD= 25 muA, which is a current often used in precision quantized Hall resistance measurements. In this case, however, we do not know the value ofEt(ymax), so we use a linear interpolation of the value ofymaxbetween its values forISD= 0 muA and 215 muA. The quantities shown inTable 1forISD= 25 muA are relatively insensitive to this choice forymax. We now plot the potentials, usingEqs. (2),(3),(15)to(19), and(21). Figure 5showsVc(y) andVr(y) for the parameters used inTable 1atISD= 215 muA, except that the plot is between +/-0.99999w/2 (+/-199.998 mum) rather thanymaxandyminin order to show the sharpness of the confining potential and the extent of the charge-redistribution potential at these extreme values ofy. Figure 6showsVt(y) plotted betweenymaxandyminusing the parameters inTable 1atISD= 215 muA and 225 muA. Other than moving farther to the right, the total potential does not significantly change shape with increasing current. Figure 7showsVt(y) atISD= 25 muA. The shape of this predicted potential is in excellent agreement with the experimental measurements shown inFig. 6of Fontein et al. [8]. It is this agreement which provides the best verification of our results. The "linear" part of the potential distribution within the sample interior, attributed in Ref. [8] to heating effects which causeRNone=VNone/ISDto increase, is accounted for by our charge-redistribution potential in a sample which has minimal heating at these currents [24]. The electric fieldsEc(y) = -? c(y) andEr(y) = -? Vr(y) are shown inFig. 8forISD= 215 muA; they were determined fromEqs. (2),(3),(18), and(20). The value ofymax= 199.599 mum is such thatEt(ymax) = 1.1*106V/m inequation (23). The contribution to the total electric field atymaxis slightly more for the confining potential than for the charge-redistribution potential at this current. Table 1shows that the confining potential also provides the dominant contribution toEt(ymax) at other currents. The location,ymax, of the last-filled state on the right-hand side of the sample increases with applied currentISD. We can useEq. (A-3)andTable 1to determine what part of this increase inymaxis due to the increase in the total electric field atymax. The percentage contributions, relative to the values ofymaxandEt(ymax) atISD= 0 muA, are 4 %, 5 %, and 3 %, forISD= 25 muA, 215 muA, and 225 muA, respectively. Therefore, most of the increase inymaxis due to the Lorentz force pushing the electrons closer to the side of the sample. The current densityJt(y) for electrons moving in the positivexdirection isNoneNoneFigure 9showsJt(y) forISD= 25 muA, 215 muA, and 225 muA. The maximum two-dimensional current density is atymax, and is 85 A/m and 325 A/m, respectively atISD= 215 muA and 225 muA. There is current in the negativexdirection in the vicinity ofyminat small currents due to the dominance of the confining potential. WhenISD= 215 muA and 225 muA, however,Er(ymin) greater than |Ec(ymin)| and no current flows in the -xdirection anywhere across the sample. The currentI(y) for electrons moving in the positivexdirection isNoneNonewhereNoneNoneandNoneNoneWe divide the sample width into 20 equal segments inFig. 10and determine the percentage of current flowing through each segment forISD= 25 muA, 215 muA, and 225 muA. We do not show a plot forISD= 0 muA, butDeltaIwould be -0.81 muA and +0.81 muA for the left-hand side and right-hand side segments, respectively, and zero for the other 18 segments becauseIc(rhs) = -Ic(lhs) = 0.81 muA. The current distributions inFig. 10are virtually identical between 25 muA and 215 muA, even though large numbers of electrons are being excited into higher Landau levels at 215 muA. The left and right side distributions are nearly symmetric. There is, however, a significant transfer of current from the left-hand side segment to the right-hand side segment at 225 muA. We saw in Sec. 5.2 that no current flows within 60, 55, and 13 magnetic lengths of the sample side forISD= 25 muA, 215 muA, and 225 muA, respectively. Also, 68 %, 70 %, and 51 % of the current is in the 19 segments to the left of the right-hand side segment where the edge channel current would flow for these three applied currents. The current density was negative in the left-hand side ofFig. 9atISD= 25 muA because electrons were flowing in the-xdirection atymin-199.554 mum, but that contribution toDeltaIin the left-hand side segment ofFig. 10is so small that the net current is positive. Finally, we investigate the charge-redistribution -edeltasigma(y) of the electrons in the 2DEG in terms of the deviation deltasigma(y) in the number of electrons/cm2from the average numberns= 5.94*1011/cm2on thei= 2 plateau at 12.3 T, whereNoneNonefromEq. (A-5). Figure 11is a logarithmic plot of |deltasigma(y)| versusyforISD= 215 muA. There is an excess of electrons on the +yside of the sample, and a depletion on the -yside. An assumption made in derivingEq. (A-5)was that the charge density varies slowly across the sample, i.e., thatrho(y) ? rho(y+dy), or deltasigma(y)s. This assumption is valid here because the largest value of deltasigma(y) occurs atymax, and is 2 %, 2 %, and 6 % ofnsatISD= 25 muA, 215 muA, and 225 muA, respectively. One of the consequences of our approximate form of the charge-redistribution potential is that the net charge does not vanish when the charge-redistribution -edeltasigma(y) sample width. The area under the curves inFig. 11is 4 % larger for the +yside than for the -yside. Therefore, there is an unaccounted excess of electrons; so this is not quite the actual shape of the charge-redistribution function. However, it is the potential and current distributions that are of primary importance to the transport properties-not the charge-redistribution. The charge was certainly conserved in the experiment of Fontein et al. [8], and yet their measured potential distributions are symmetrical. This fact demonstrates that the slight charge asymmetry does not significantly affect the potential and current distributions. We could conserve the charge by adjusting the origin slightly to the right until the area under the curves are equal for +/-yinFig. 11, and then self-consistently recalculating the potentials with the new coordinates. This would greatly complicate the calculations however, and with all the approximations that have been made in this paper, and with the excellent agreement with experiment [8], it seems unnecessary. It may be a consequence of this charge nonconservation problem that the value ofyminis inside the confining potential for the case inTable 1whenISD= 225muA. Balaban, Meirav, and Shtrikman [10] have found that the critical current for breakdown of the quantum Hall effect,Icr, scales logarithmically with the sample widthwfor all Landau levels. We verify this dependence by: (a) using the result in Sec. 3.3 thatIc(rhs) = -Ic(lhs) = 0.81 muA for thei= 2 plateau at 12.3 T whenISD= 0 muA; (b) calculating the value ofymaxfromEqs. (2)and(5)for each value ofwatISD= 0 muA; (c) calculating the value ofGfromEq. (17)for each value ofw; (d) definingIcras the applied currentISDsufficient to excite the lowest,M= 1, QUILLS transitions [11,25-28]; (e) assuming the value ofEc(ymax) is the same for all values ofISDthat exciteM= 1 QUILLS transitions (The value used isEc(ymax) = 5.96*105V/m, obtained fromTable 1atISD= 215 muA,w= 400 mum, andEt(ymax) = 1.1*106V/m. This is equivalent to fixing the value ofIc(rhs) to be 2.30 muA for each value ofIcr); (f) calculating the value ofymaxfromEq. (2)for each value ofw; (g) adjusting the value ofIrso thatEt(ymax) = 1.1*106V/m inEqs. (2),(17),(20), and(23); and (h) adjusting the value ofyminto give the correct Hall voltage for each current by usingEqs. (2),(15),(17),(21), and(22). The results ofIcrversusware plotted inFig. 12. The shape of the curve is identical to the experimental data of Balaban et al. [10]. The scaling is very different, however because their critical currents are about two orders of magnitude smaller than ours. We note that the experiment of Haug, von Klitzing, and Plog [29] tends to agree with the experimental curve shapes of Balaban et al. [10], but the experiment of Kawaji, Hirakawa, and Nagata [30] found a linear, rather than a logoarithmic, dependence ofIcrwithw. Perhaps this difference is due to nonuniformities in the values of the charge-depletion widthNonealong the sides of the samples, e.g., we have observed different values ofIcralong the lengths of some of our samples. If we assume that the value ofVmremains constant along a sample edge, allowNoneto vary by changing the average ionized donor densityND, and assume the ratioEc(ymax)/Et(ymax) remains constant, then we find that the critical current required to exciteM= 1 QUILLS transitions withEt(ymax) = 1.1*106 V/m decreases whenDeltadecreases andNDincreases, i.e., the steeper the confining potential, the smaller the critical current. We have calculated potential and current distributions across the width of a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure sample for applied currents between 0 muA and 225 muA, using: (a) a quadratic confining potentialVc(y) arising from charge-depletion regions along the sides of the sample; (b) parameters for that potential obtained from a localization experiment [9]; (c) a logarithmic charge-redistribution potentialVr(y) of the 2DEG; and (d) a maximum electric fieldEt(ymax) calculated from breakdown measurements and a QUILLS model [11]. Our predictions are in excellent agreement with experiments [8,10]. Referring toTable 1, the confining potential componentEc(ymax) of the electric field atymaxcontributes 88 %, 54 %, and 57 % toEt(ymax) at 25 muA, 215 muA, and 225 muA, respectively. The maximum current densityJt(ymax) is 34 A/m, 85 A/m, and 325 A/m, respectively at these three currents. A significant amount of current is distributed within the sample interior. For example,Iris 99 %, 99 %, and 83 % ofISD, respectively at these three currents. We predict the current to be much farther from the sides of the sample than in other models, e.g., no current flows within 60, 55, and 13 magnetic lengths of the sample side for these currents. It would require a lateral resolution of about 0.1 mum, rather than the 70 mum resolution of Fontein et al. [8], to verify this result.
