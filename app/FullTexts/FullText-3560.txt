Obesity, type 2 diabetes, and the metabolic syndrome are some of the major medical and economical challenges of modern societies. Dysregulation of carbohydrate management, increased consumption of carbohydrates and fat, and reduced insulin receptor sensitivity contribute to the metabolic derangements. Drugs that reduce small intestinal uptake ofd-glucose and/or reabsorption ofd-glucose from the renal filtrate or that modulate secretion of insulinotropic enterohormones can provide new therapeutic strategies (1,2). To further explore these options a better understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms is required. The primary transporters that mediate transcellular movements ofd-glucose in small intestine have been identified and include the Na+-d-glucose cotransporter SGLT1 and GLUT2 (3,4). It is generally accepted that SGLT1 mediates uptake of low concentrations ofd-glucose across the brush-border membrane (BBM) of the small intestine and thatd-glucose leaves enterocytes across the basolateral membrane (BLM) via GLUT2 (3). However, their relative contributions tod-glucose absorption after a carbohydrate-rich meal remain controversial (5-7). Kellet and coworkers suggested that under these conditions GLUT2 is incorporated into the BBM allowing mass absorption ofd-glucose via GLUT2 (5,6,8). However, the observation that small intestinal mass absorption ofd-glucose in mice was not significantly changed when GLUT2 was removed (9) contradicts this hypothesis. Among other dietary stimulants,d-glucose can trigger the intestinal secretion of glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) by K-cells as well as the secretion of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) byL-cells (10-12). Potential glucose sensing systems expressed in these enteroendocrine cells include sweet taste receptors and glucose transporters like SGLT1, but their roles in glucose-induced secretion of GLP-1 and GIP have not been fully established (7,13-16). There is agreement that the bulk ofd-glucose filtered in the glomeruli of the kidney is reabsorbed in the S1 and S2 segments of proximal tubules via SGLT2 in the BBM and GLUT2 in the BLM (17), and it is generally assumed that the remaining glucose is reabsorbed in the S2 and S3 segments via SGLT1 in BBM and GLUT1 in the BLM. However, the physiological significance and quantitative contribution of SGLT1 for renal reabsorption ofd-glucose has not been directly determined (17). In the present work we generated and characterized the phenotype of anSglt1Nonemouse model to gain new insights. We report that these mice show symptoms of the glucose-galactose malabsorption (GGM) syndrome (OMIM 182380) that appears to be cured by a diet low in glucose and galactose (18,19). The experiments identify SGLT1 as the primary pathway for the transport ofd-glucose across the BBM duringd-glucose mass absorption and show that SGLT1 is essential for the glucose-induced release of GIP and GLP-1 into the peripheral circulation. Finally, we establish a small but significant contribution of SGLT1 to renald-glucose reabsorption under normoglycemic conditions. Mice were handled in compliance with Institutional guidelines and German, U.K., and U.S. laws. Comparison betweenSglt1Noneand wild-type mice was performed between the 8th and 12th generation of backcrossing ofSglt1None(129/OLA/C57BL/6 background) with wild-type (C57BL/6 background). Animals were kept in a temperature-controlled environment with a 12-h-light/12-h-dark cycle. Standard maintenance chow (Ssniff V1534-000 R/M-H, 10 mm) was obtained from Spezialdiaten GmbH, Soest, Germany. It contained 12.8 MJ kgNone1metabolizable energy and was composed of 36.4% starch, 19% protein, 4.9% fiber, 4.7% mono- and disaccharides, and 3.3% fat, minerals, and vitamins. The glucose-galactose-free diet was prepared by Altromin Spezialfutter GmbH (Lage, Germany) and contained 13.2 MJ kgNone1metabolizable energy. It was composed of 33.8% protein, 30.7% fiber, and 20.5% fat, minerals, and vitamins. The antibodies used are described inTable 1. Description of antibodiesImmunofluorescence histochemistry was performed with cryo-sections ofp-formaldehyde-fixed tissue as described (22). For double staining sections were first incubated with GIP-Ab or GLP-1-Ab and respective secondary antibody and washed. Thereafter sections were incubated overnight at 4 degrees C with SGLT1-Ab, rinsed with PBS, incubated with GAR-AF555 for 60 min at room temperature, and washed. Laser scanning fluorescence microscopy was performed with a confocal laser-scanning imaging system, LSM-510 using the argon laser for green fluorochromes (lambdaex= 488 nm, LP505 nm), and the helium-neon laser for red fluorochromes (lambdaex= 543 nm, BP560-615 nm) (Zeiss, Jena, Germany). The Zeiss LSM-510 software 2.5 SP2 stack, multi track, 8 bit scan mode was used. After a 16- to 18-h fasting period mice were gavaged with a 10%d-glucose solution (2 mg/g body wt) in PBS, a 40%d-glucose solution (6 mg/g body wt) in PBS, or with olive oil (10 uL/g body wt). Control animals were gavaged with PBS. For determination ofd-glucose and insulin blood was collected from the tail. Concentrations ofd-glucose were determined with an Ascensia CONTOUR Meter using Ascensia MICROFIL Test Strips (Bayer Vial GmbH, Leverkusen). Insulin levels were measured with the Insulin (Mouse) Ultrasensitive EIA from ALPCO Diagnostics (Salem, NH). For determination of enterohormones, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and blood was collected after heart tap. For GLP-1 determination blood was immediately mixed with a dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-IV inhibitor yielding a final concentration of 100 mumol/L (Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA). Active GLP-1 was determined by an ELISA kit supplied by Millipore Corporation (GLP-1(7-36) active, kit EGLP-35 K) (Fig. 5None). Total GLP-1 was determined by an ELISA kit provided by MesoScale Discovery (Gaithersburg, MD; kit K150JVC-4;Fig. 5Noneand SupplementaryFig. 5None). GIP was determined by an ELISA kit obtained from Millipore Corporation that is specific for both active GIP (1-42) and inactivated GIP (3-42) of rat and mouse (kit EZRMGIP-55 K). Mice were killed 30 min after gavage. BBM vesicles (BBMVs) were isolated by magnesium precipitation followed by differential centrifugation. Small intestines of three mice were homogenized in 35 mL of homogenization buffer (100 mmol/L mannitol, 2 mmol/L HEPES/Tris [pH 7.1]). MgCl2solution (1 mol/L) was added to a concentration of 10 mmol/L, and the suspension was kept on ice for 20 min. After 15 min centrifugation at 3,000g, the pellet containing nuclei and mitochondria was discarded. The supernatant was centrifuged for 30 min at 27,000g, and the resulting pellet was suspended in 35 mL vesicle buffer (100 mmol/L mannitol, 20 mmol/L HEPES/Tris [pH 7.4]). After 30 min centrifugation at 27,000g, the pellet was suspended in 300 uL vesicle buffer. The BBMVs were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70 degrees C until use. BBMVs were thawed in a water bath, and uptake of radiolabeled substrates was determined at 22 degrees C using the rapid filtration technique (23). To measure sodium-dependent and phlorizin-inhibitable uptake of alpha-methyl-d-glucoside (AMG), vesicles were incubated with vesicle buffer containing 0.1 mmol/L [14C]AMG plus either 100 mmol/L NaSCN or 100 mmol/L NaSCN plus 0.2 mmol/L phlorizin or 100 mmol/L KSCN. Uptake was stopped with ice-cold vesicle buffer containing 100 mmol/L NaSCN plus 0.2 mmol/L phlorizin (stop solution), and vesicles were washed on nitrocellulose filters with stop solution. The radioactivity on the filters was measured and phlorizin-inhibitable or sodium-dependent AMG uptake was calculated. To measure GLUT2-mediatedd-glucose uptake, which is inhibited by glucosamine (24), BBMVs were incubated for 1 min at 22 degrees C with 20 mmol/L HEPES/Tris [pH 7.4] containing 100 mmol/L [3H]-d-glucose plus 100 mmol/L mannitol or plus 100 mmol/Ld-glucosamine. Uptake was stopped with ice-cold 20 mmol/L HEPES/Tris [pH 7.4] containing 100 mmol/L mannitol plus 100 mmol/Ld-glucosamine, and vesicles were washed on nitrocellulose filters. Everted rings of duodenum and jejunum were incubated for 2 min in Krebs-Ringer buffer containing 7 mumol/L [14C]AMG without and with 0.2 mmol/L phlorizin. Uptake was stopped with ice-cold Ringer buffer containing 0.2 mmol/L phlorizin. The length of individual segments was measured under a microscope, the segments were solubilized, and radioactivity was analyzed. SGLT1 was expressed in oocytes ofXenopus laevis, and measurements of AMG uptake were performed as described (25). The cDNA of mouseSglt1(accession number BC003845) was cloned into the vector pRSSP, and m7G(5')G-capped cRNA was prepared. Oocytes were injected with 5 ng of mouseSglt1cRNA and incubated 2 days for expression. For transport measurements the oocytes were incubated for 20 min at room temperature with [14C]AMG or [3H]d-glucose in the absence and presence of 100 mumol/L phlorizin, and phlorizin-inhibited uptake was analyzed. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal glucose reabsorption were determined in awake and anesthetized mice as described previously (20,26,27). The strategy to generate mice lacking part of theSglt1promotor and the first exon ofSglt1is outlined inSupplementary Fig. 1None. Sglt1Nonemice andSglt1Nonemice were identified by Southern blots and PCR (Supplementary Fig. 1NoneandNone). To verify effects on glucose transport, we expressed murineSglt1or murineSglt1mutant without exon 1 inXenopus laevisoocytes and measured phlorizin (100 mumol/L)-inhibitable uptake of 50 mumol/L AMG, a SGLT-specific substrate that is not transported by GLUT transporters. Whereas a high transport activity was observed after expression of SGLT1 wild type, no significant AMG uptake was observed with the SGLT1 mutant (Supplementary Fig. 2). Breeding ofSglt1heterozygote mice demonstrated Mendelian type inheritance (from 531 outcomes 51% were heterozygotes, 27% wild type, and 22%Sglt1None), indicating embryonic survival ofSglt1Nonemice. Whereas preweaningSglt1Nonemice appeared to be healthy,Sglt1Nonemice died within 2 days after weaning when they received standard diet. In contrast, weanedSglt1Nonemice survived well and were fertile when they were fed a diet that did not contain free monosaccharides and disaccharides (Fig. 1None). To determine whether the inactivation ofSglt1in mice induced a GGM syndrome as in humans (19), two-month-old mice fed with glucose-galactose-free diet were transitioned to standard diet (Fig. 1None). Whereas wild-type mice did not show a significant change in weight, theSglt1Nonemice appeared unwell after 2 days, became weaker, lost body weight, and died within 7 to 12 days after the dietary change (Fig. 1None). Laparatomy 2 days after reapplication of standard diet revealed distended small and large intestines in theSglt1Nonemice (Fig. 1None). Absence ofSglt1mRNA and SGLT1 protein in the small intestine ofSglt1Nonemice was verified by Northern blotting, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry (Fig. 1None-None). Deletion ofSglt1in small intestine leads to GGM syndrome that can be prevented by a glucose-galactose-reduced diet. A: Body weight development after weaning. Sglt1Nonemice receiving standard diet (s.d.) were bred. Newborn mice were genotyped 3 weeks after birth. After weaning,Sglt1NoneandSglt1Nonemice were kept on standard diet or glucose/galactose-reduced diet (r.d.). Mean values +/- SE of 8 animals are shown. B: Body weight development of 2-month-old mice that have been kept on glucose-galactose-reduced diet and were then switched to standard diet. Mean values +/- SE are shown;n= 5 wild-type and 5Sglt1Nonemice (initial number of mice). Death of oneSglt1Nonemouse; Death of twoSGLT1Nonemice. C: Appearance of abdominal contents of 2-month-old mice kept on glucose-galactose-reduced diet after weaning that were fed 2 days with standard diet. D: Northern blots with mRNAs isolated from small intestines of 2-month-old mice hybridized with cDNA fragments ofSglt1or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). A 176 bpSglt1fragment comprising nucleotides 1727-1902 (accession number AF163846) and a 1.1 kb fragment of human GAPDH (Clontech, Heidelberg, Germany) was used. E: Western blots of small intestinal BBMs of 2-month-old mice, which were performed as described (28), were stained with antibody against SGLT1 (SGLT1-Ab, diluted 1:2,000). F: Immunohistochemistry of small intestine with SGLT1-Ab (dilution of SGLT1-Ab, 1:1,000; scale bar, 20 um). G: Phlorizin-inhibitable uptake of 7 mumol/L AMG into enterocytes of everted rings of small intestine. Because phlorizin-inhibitable AMG uptake in duodenum and jejunum was not significantly different the measurements from both regions were combined. Mean values of phlorizin-inhibitable AMG uptake +/- SE from four independent experiments are shown. H:d-glucose induced transepithelial short-circuit currents (Isc). Small intestinal mucosa mounted into Ussing chambers was superfused at 37 degrees C in the presence of 20 mmol/L mannitol or 20 mmol/Ld-glucose, and electrogenic glucose uptake was measured as described (29). Mean values +/- SE of five experiments. *P less than 0.05, **P less than 0.01, ***P less than 0.001 determined by Studentttests. (A high-quality digital representation of this figure is available in the online issue.) To determine the contribution of SGLT1 to Na+-dglucose cotransport across BBM of small intestine we compared AMG uptake across the BBM of wild-type versusSglt1Nonemice. Comparison was performed in mice fed a glucose-galactose-free diet. Three methods were used: measurement of phlorizin-inhibitable AMG uptake into everted rings of small intestine (Fig. 1None), measurement of glucose-induced short circuit currents across small intestinal mucosa (Fig. 1None), and measurement of phlorizin-inhibitable AMG uptake into isolated BBMVs (Fig. 2None). The data show that absence of SGLT1 abolishes Na+-d-glucose cotransport across the small intestinal BBM. Mice express SGLT1 homologs SGLT3a and SGLT3b (30). Confirming recently reported data (30), we observed phlorizin-inhibitable uptake of AMG after expression of SGLT3b in oocytes ofXenopus laevis. By comparison, phlorizin-inhibitable AMG uptake could not be detected after expression of SGLT3a (Supplementary Fig. 3None). Using immunohistochemistry we observed immunoreactivity of an antibody raised against SGLT3b at the BBM of small intestinal enterocytes (Supplementary Fig. 3None). The functional data in BBMs, however, indicate that SGLT3b activity cannot substitute for SGLT1. Upregulation of small intestinald-glucose absorption after application of ad-glucose bolus to the stomach. A:d-glucose concentrations in the plasma after gavage withd-glucose (2 mg/g body wt;Sglt1None, ?,Sglt1None, ?) or buffer (Sglt1None, ? ;Sglt1None, ?). ***P less than 0.001,Sglt1Nonemice after glucose gavage vs.Sglt1Nonemice after glucose gavage; P less than 0.001 differences to thed-glucose concentration inSglt1Nonemice before glucose gavage. B-F: Properties of small intestine BBMVs of controlSglt1NoneandSglt1Nonemice (-bolus) and ofSglt1NoneandSglt1Nonemice that had received ad-glucose bolus (6 mg/g body wt) 30 min earlier (+bolus). B:Kmvalues for AMG of Na+-dependent uptake of [14C]AMG into BBMVs. Uptake rates were measured after incubation for 5 s in the presence of an inwardly directed gradient of 100 mmol/L NaSCN or 100 mmol/L KSCN, and the differences were calculated. C: Phlorizin-inhibitable uptake of AMG into BBMVs. Uptake of 0.1 mmol/L [14C]AMG was measured after incubation for 2 s in the absence and presence of 200 mumol/L phlorizin, and the differences were calculated. Vmaxvalues were calculated according to the Michaelis Menten equation using theKmvalues determined inB. D: SGLT1 protein expressed in BBMVs. Western blots of BBMVs (26) were stained with SGLT1-Ab (diluted 1:2,000), and the staining was quantified by densitometry. E: Glucosamine-inhibitable uptake ofd-glucose into BBMVs. Uptake rates of 100 mmol/L [3H]d-glucose were measured in the absence and presence of 100 mmol/Ld-glucosamine, and the differences were calculated. Because the Michaelis Menten constant (Km) value of mouse GLUT2 ford-glucose is ?17 mmol/L (4), the uptake rates of 100 mmol/Ld-glucose representVmaxvalues. E: GLUT2 protein expression in BBMVs. Western blots of BBMVs (27) were stained with antibody against human GLUT2 (diluted 1:500) cross-reacting with mouse GLUT2. Staining was quantified by densitometry. Means +/- SE are presented. The number of independent experiments is indicated in parentheses. Significances of differences are calculated by ANOVA with post hoc Tukey comparison. *P less than 0.05; **P less than 0.01; ***P less than 0.001; rel., relative. Kellet and coworkers raised the hypothesis that at high luminal glucose concentrations GLUT2 is incorporated into the BBM and is the dominant pathway ford-glucose translocation across the BBM under these conditions (5,6,8). These authors postulated that the incorporation of GLUT2 into the BBM is triggered by SGLT1 activity leading to activation of the Ca2+channel Cav1.3 (5,8). However, in a more recent review it was proposed that Cav1.3 is activated by sweet taste receptors and endocrine and paracrine hormones including insulin (6). We compared the increase of plasmad-glucose concentrations after gavage of a solution containingd-glucose (2 mg/g body wt) in wild-type versusSglt1Nonemice (Fig. 2None). In wild-type mice the increase ofd-glucose concentrations in plasma was significantly higher than inSglt1Nonemice (3.3-fold vs. 1.8-fold after 13 min). The increase of plasmad-glucose after glucose gavage inSglt1Nonemice (1.8 +/- 0.2-fold) was similar in magnitude to the increase observed inSglt1Nonemice (1.8 +/- 0.1-fold) and wild-type mice (1.7 +/- 0.1-fold) after gavage of solvent control (Fig. 2None) and may reflect stress (adrenalin)-induced release ofd-glucose from the liver. These data provide evidence that SGLT1 is required for small intestinal mass absorption ofd-glucose. To determine whetherd-glucose transport across the BBM after a glucose bolus is mediated by SGLT1 or GLUT2 we performed studies with BBMVs from wild-type andSglt1Nonemice. About 10-fold higherKmvalues were obtained for SGLT1-mediated uptake ofd-glucose/AMG across small intestinal BBMs of wild-type mice compared with values obtained fromXenopusoocytes expressing mouse SGLT1 (Fig. 3). BBMVs were prepared from mice gavaged with PBS or PBS containingd-glucose (6 mg/g body wt) and killed 30 min later. Whereas in BBMVs of wild-type mice, which received the glucose bolus, theKmvalue of sodium-dependent AMG uptake was modestly (25%) reduced compared with wild-type mice receiving only PBS (Fig. 2None), theVmaxvalue of AMG uptake was 4.4-fold increased (Fig. 2None). The corresponding amount of SGLT1 protein in BBMVs estimated from Western blots was increased 2.4-fold (Fig. 2None). In BBMVs ofSglt1Nonemice no uptake of the SGLT specific substrate AMG was detectable without and withd-glucose gavage (Fig. 2None). The data indicate upregulation of SGLT1 expression in the BBM after gavage withd-glucose in mice. The substrate dependence of SGLT1-mediated glucose uptake expressed in oocytes is different from the substrate dependence of SGLT1-mediated glucose uptake across small intestinal BBM. AandB: Transport measurements in oocytes. Oocytes were injected with 5 ng of mouseSglt1cRNA and incubated 2 days for expression. Uptake of different concentrations of [14C]AMG (A) or [3H]d-glucose (B) was measured in the absence and presence of 100 mumol/L phlorizin. Phlorizin-inhibitable uptake rates of individual experiments were normalized to the uptake rates measured at 2 mmol/L AMG ord-glucose. Mean values+SE of 25-30 oocytes from 3 independent experiments are shown. Similar apparentKmvalues of 0.17 +/- 0.05 mmol/L and 0.13 +/- 0.01 mmol/L were obtained for AMG andd-glucose, respectively. TheVmaxvalues of SGLT1-mediated uptake of AMG andd-glucose were similar. In oocytes of the same batch, which were injected with 5 ng ofSglt1cRNA per oocyte and incubated for 2 days,Vmaxvalues (measured at monosaccharide concentrations of 2 mmol/L without and with 100 mumol/L phlorizin) of 5.0 +/- 0.6 (AMG) and 4.8 +/- 0.6 (d-glucose) pmol * oocyteNone1* minNone1were obtained (n= 25 each, not significant). C: Transport measurements in BBMVs. Wild-type mice fed with standard diet were starved for 18 h and killed at 3-4p.m.BBMVs were prepared. BBMVs were incubated for 2 s at 37 degrees C with different concentrations of [14C]AMG in the presence of an inwardly directed gradient of 100 mmol/L NaSCN or 100 mmol/L KSCN. The sodium-dependent uptake rates of individual experiments were normalized to the values obtained at 10 mmol/L AMG. Mean values +/- SE of 12 measurements from three independent experiments are shown. AKmvalue of 1.20 +/- 0.04 mmol/L (n= 5) was determined. D: Glucose-induced short circuit currents across small intestinal mucosa. Wild-type mice fed with standard diet were starved for 18 h and killed at 4p.m. The jejunal small intestinal wall was then mounted to an Ussing chamber. The mucosal side was superfused with different concentrations ofd-glucose, andd-glucose-induced short circuit currents (Isc) mediated by Na+-d-glucose cotransport was measured. Mean values +/- SE of 7 experiments are shown. The Michaelis Menten equation was fitted to the data. AKmvalue of 1.9 +/- 0.6 mmol/L was determined. Maximal transport activity (Vmax) of GLUT2 across the BBM was determined by measuring the uptake of 100 mmol/Ld-glucose (partially [3H]-labeled) that could be blocked by the GLUT2 specific inhibitor glucosamine (100 mmol/L) (24). In oocytes expressing mouse SGLT1 we verified that glucosamine does not inhibit SGLT1 (Supplementary Fig. 4). Vmaxof GLUT2-mediatedd-glucose uptake into BBMVs in wild-type mice without glucose gavage was similar toSglt1Nonemice without or with glucose gavage (43-70 pmol * mgNone1* sNone1;Fig. 2None). Gavage ofd-glucose increasedVmaxof GLUT2-mediatedd-glucose uptake into BBMVs of wild-type mice 2.7-fold (168 +/- 31 pmol * mgNone1 * sNone1). Western blots using antibodies against GLUT2 from human (GLUT-Ab) that cross-react with mouse GLUT2 (21) showed a similar magnitude in the increase of GLUT2 protein expression in BBMVs of wild-type mice after thed-glucose bolus (Fig. 2None). The increase in both the GLUT2 protein expression and the GLUT2-mediatedd-glucose uptake in response to the glucose bolus were blunted inSglt1Nonemice. These findings are consistent with a role of SGLT1 in the upregulation of GLUT2 activity in the BBM by high glucose concentration. Withoutd-glucose bolus theVmaxof AMG uptake via SGLT1 was 5.5 times higher than maximald-glucose uptake via GLUT2, and after glucose gavage theVmaxof AMG uptake via SGLT1 was 8.7 times higher compared withd-glucose uptake via GLUT2 (compareFig. 2NoneandNone). This indicates thatd-glucose uptake via the luminal membrane of small intestinal enterocytes is predominantly ( greater than 80%) mediated via SGLT1. We investigated the expression of SGLT1 in enteroendocrineL-cells and K-cells, which are known to secrete GLP-1 and GIP, respectively (Fig. 4). Immunohistochemistry was performed using double staining with specific primary antibodies raised in rabbit or goat and fluorophore-labeled secondary antibodies raised in chicken. Fluorescence was visualized by laser scanning microscopy using an optical section thickness of 0.1 um. Coexpression of SGLT1 with GLP-1 and GIP was observed in individual cells of jejunal crypts. SGLT1-Ab immunoreactivity was observed at the BBM of enteroendocrine cells, whereas immunoreactivities for antibodies against GIP or GLP-1 were predominantly observed in intracellular compartments (Fig. 4). Expression of SGLT1 in enteroendocrine cells. Sections from jejunum of mice were first incubated with antibodies against GIP or GLP-1 raised in goat and then with SGLT1-Ab raised in rabbit (GIP-Ab and GLP-1 were diluted 1:100, and SGLT1-Ab diluted 1:1,000). Staining was performed with fluorescent-labeled secondary antibodies (diluted 1:800) against goat IgG (GIP or GLP-1, green) and rabbit IgG (SGLT1, red). AandB: K-cell in crypts. C: L-cell in a crypt. Scale bar, 5 um. (A high-quality digital representation of this figure is available in the online issue.) Oral application ofd-glucose stimulates the pancreatic secretion of insulin more than intravenous application. In humans, this surplus of insulin secretion is a result of the combined effects of GIP and GLP-1 (12,31). After exposure of the small intestine to high glucose the concentrations of these enterohormones increase in systemic blood. Thirteen minutes after glucose gavage (2 mg/g body wt), plasma insulin was approximately two times higher in wild-type mice compared withSglt1Nonemice (Fig. 5None). At the same time, GIP was increased ?10-fold in the systemic blood of wild-type mice but was not changed inSglt1Nonemice (Fig. 5None). By comparison 13 min after gavage with olive oil (10 uL/g body wt), GIP increased four- to fivefold in the systemic blood of both wild-type andSglt1Nonemice. Thirteen minutes after glucose gavage the active GLP-1 concentration in systemic blood was not increased in wild-type orSglt1Nonemice, whereas application of oil induced a SGLT1-independent twofold increase in active GLP-1 (Fig. 5None). Because the concentration of active GLP-1 in systemic blood may be reduced by degradation we also measured total GLP-1 in the systemic blood 5 min after gavage of a greaterd-glucose load (6 mg/g body wt;Fig. 5None). Under these conditions a significant glucose-dependent increase of GLP-1 concentration was observed in wild-type mice but not inSglt1Nonemice. Measuring glucose-dependent stimulation of GIP and GLP-1 secretion from primary intestinal cultures prepared fromSglt1NoneandSgltNonemice, we confirmed that SGLT1 is required for glucose-dependent stimulation of these enterohormones (Supplementary Fig. 5). Secretion of insulin, GIP, and GLP-1 after gavage withd-glucose inSglt1Nonemice versusSgltNonemice. A: Effect ofd-glucose gavage (2 mg/g body wt) on systemic plasma insulin concentrations.

None: Concentration of total GLP-1 in systemic blood plasma 5 min after gavage with PBS (B bolus) ord-glucose (G bolus; 6 mg/g body wt). *P less than 0.05, **P less than 0.01, ***P less than 0.001, Studentttests. In kidney the low affinity Na+-d-glucose cotransporter SGLT2 is located in BBMs of S1 segments of proximal tubules, whereas the high affinity Na+-d-glucose cotransporter SGLT1 is located in BBMs of the S2 and S3 segments (20,22). We confirmed that no expression of SGLT1 was observed in kidneys ofSglt1Nonemice (Supplementary Figs. 6Noneand 7None) and determined at mRNA and protein levels that the expression of SGLT2 was not changed after removal of SGLT1 (Supplementary Figs. 6Noneand 7NoneandNone). In wild-type andSglt1Nonemice similar mRNA and protein concentrations of the passive glucose transporters GLUT1, GLUT2, and GLUT5 were determined (Supplementary Fig. 7NoneandNone). Spontaneous urine collections in awake male mice revealed that urinary glucose concentrations were significantly increased inSglt1Nonecompared with wild-type mice, whereas blood glucose levels were not different (Fig. 6None). Fractional glucose reabsorption was 100% in male wild-type and 97% in maleSglt1Nonemice (Fig. 6None). In male mice, GFR measured in awake and anesthetized animals, blood pressure, heart rate, plasma urea concentrations, food intake and fluid intake, and renal excretion of fluid, Na+, and ClNonewere not changed after removal of SGLT1. Details and differences in food intake and fluid intake between males and females are described in theSupplementary Data. Effects of SGLT1 removal on renal glucose excretion. A:d-glucose concentrations measured in spontaneous urine collections and subsequently obtained blood collections from tail vein of awake male mice (for experimental details [29]). B: Absolute renal excretion and fractional reabsorption of glucose in maleSglt1NoneversusSglt1Nonemice as function of the amount of filtered glucose. GFR was measured in awake mice using the plasma kinetics of FITC-inulin after a single dose intravenous injection (26). Mean values +/- SE are shown. bw, Body weight. Quantitative free-flow collections of tubular fluid were performed from the last surface loop of proximal convoluted tubules. Mean values for single nephron GFR and the amount of glucose filtered per nephron were not different between maleSglt1Noneand wild-type mice (Fig. 7NoneandNone). However, the concentration and delivery of glucose were increased inSglt1Noneversus wild-type mice, whereas fractional glucose reabsorption was reduced (Fig. 7NoneandNone). In contrast with fractional reabsorption of glucose, fractional reabsorption of fluid and chloride was not significantly different between maleSglt1Noneand wild-type mice (fluid: 0.48 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.45 +/- 0.03; chloride: 0.47 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.45 +/- 0.03;n= 17-25 nephrons in each group, not significant). Micropuncture studies in male wild-type andSglt1Nonemice. Mice were anesthetized with thiobutabarbital (100 mg/kg i.p.) plus ketamine (100 mg/kg i.m.) and prepared for renal micropuncture as described (20,27). A catheter was placed in the femoral artery for continuous blood pressure recording, and a bladder catheter was applied for urine collections. For assessment of GFR, [3H]inulin was added to the infusion to deliver 20 uCi/h and urine was quantitatively collected. To determine proximal glucose reabsorption, quantitative free-flow fluid collections were made from the last surface loop of proximal convoluted tubules and tubular fluid volume was determined from transfer to a constant bore capillary. Concentrations of glucose in plasma, urine, and tubular fluid were determined as described (27). A: GFRs of single nephrons (SNGFR). B: Filtration ofd-glucose by single nephrons. C:d-glucose concentrations in the last surface loops of proximal tubules. D: Amount ofd-glucose delivered to the last surface loops of proximal tubules. E: Fractional reabsorption ofd-glucose up to the last proximal tubular surface loops. Nephrons (2-25) in five to six mice/genotype were investigated. Mean values +/- SE are shown. ***P less than 0.001, Studentttests. In the current study the role of SGLT1 for small intestinal glucose absorption and incretin secretion was investigated comparing nondiabetic mice without and with expression of SGLT1. Evidence is presented that SGLT1 mediates the majority ofd-glucose transport across the BBM of enterocytes independent of the glucose load. SGLT3b, a second functional Na+-d-glucose cotransporter in the BBM of mice, does not contribute significantly. After high glucose load some GLUT2 is incorporated into the BBM, but this has minor impact on small intestinal glucose absorption. It is noteworthy that this translocation of GLUT2 was not observed inSglt1Nonemice, indicating that SGLT1 rather than sweet taste receptors is pivotal in this upregulation (5,6,8). Without and withd-glucose load the capacity of SGLT1 versus GLUT2 ford-glucose transport across the BBMs was 5.5 and 8.7 times higher, respectively. In response to continuous feeding of sugar-rich diets and during diabetes, however, the contribution of GLUT2 to small intestinal glucose absorption may become more relevant. Under these conditions the expression of SGLT1 and GLUT2 is increased, and an increase of GLUT2 in the BBM was observed after gavage with glucose or fructose (32-35). Removal of SGLT1 in mice resulted in GGM syndrome (OMIM 182380) that could be cured by a glucose-galactose-reduced diet as has been observed in patients with loss-of-function mutations in SGLT1 (SLC5A1) (18,19). GGM is characterized by severe diarrhea and dehydration as a result of osmotic loss by retention of nonabsorbedd-glucose,d-galactose, and sodium in the small intestinal lumen. In contrast with humans, where severe diarrhea and dehydration are observed in suckling neonates, sucklingSglt1Nonemice showed no obvious symptoms. This species difference may be explained by the three to four times higher concentrations of lactose in human milk compared with murine milk (36,37). In the small intestine lactose is degraded by lactase-isomaltase and provides the only relevant source ofd-glucose andd-galactose in suckling neonates. Confirming previous results (15,16) we showed that SGLT1 is expressed in the luminal membrane of enteroendocrine cells staining positive for the incretin hormones, GLP-1 and GIP. Active forms of GLP-1 and GIP are detectable in the systemic blood of human subjects after glucose ingestion (38,39), but are rapidly inactivated in the circulation by DPP-IV (10). Both GIP and GLP-1 trigger glucose-dependent insulin secretion, and although the effectiveness of GIP is impaired in people with type 2 diabetes (40), the preserved insulinotropic effect of GLP-1 (40) has led to the successful development of GLP-1 mimetics and DPP-IV inhibitors as new classes of antidiabetic agent (41). Earlier in vitro studies have demonstrated that SGLT1-mediated monosaccharide transport triggers incretin secretion via the electrogenic coupled influx of Na+, which results in membrane depolarization, electrical activity, voltage-gated Ca2+entry, and exocytosis (16,42), although the contribution of this pathway to glucose-mediated secretion in vivo has remained controversial. Using the SGLT1Nonemice we now demonstrate the pivotal role of SGLT1 for both GLP-1 and GIP secretory responses triggered by oral glucose in vivo. This is consistent with the reported phlorizin sensitivity of glucose-induced incretin increases in the portal vein (13) showing the involvement of a phlorizin-sensitive SGLT-type transporter or channel (3,30,43), as well as with the finding that incretin secretion is triggered in vivo by substrates of SGLT1 (44), but not by other sweet tasting compounds (14). The results suggest that secretion of these hormones would be initiated after food ingestion by the early arrival of even small glucose loads in the small intestine, consistent with previous reports that GLP-1 release is initiated in humans when glucose infusion rates exceed the absorption capacity of the duodenum (45). Whereas glucose is nearly completely reabsorbed by the kidneys in wild-type mice,Sglt1Nonemice lose ?3% of the filtered glucose in the urine, leading to a urinaryd-glucose concentration of ?20 mmol/L. NotablySglt2null mice lose only ?60% of the filtered glucose in the urine although the expression of SGLT1 was downregulated by 50% (20). This suggests that wild-type mice do not use the maximal transport capacity of SGLT1 at normoglycemic conditions. This is different when the glucose load to the SGLT1-expressing S2 and S3 segments is increased. In diabetic patients in which early proximal tubule glucose transport capacity is overwhelmed by highd-glucose concentrations, and even more in diabetic patients treated with an SGLT2 specific inhibitor, SGLT1 may operate at full transport capacity (17). TheSglt1null mice provide a valuable tool for future studies of SGLT1 functions under pathological conditions as well as the therapeutic potential of SGLT1 inhibition.
