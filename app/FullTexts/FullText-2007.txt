Translocations of ETS transcription factorsERG,ETV1,ETV4,ETV5andFLI1occur in half of all prostate cancer and theTMPRSS2-ERGtranslocation is the most common molecular alterationNone-None. Evidence from human tumor analysis strongly implicates aberrantETSexpression as an early if not initiating eventNone-None. Transgenic mouse models have shown that neitherERGnorETV1is sufficient to initiate prostate cancerNone-None. Unfortunately, the existing probasin based transgenicETSmodels are poorly suited for further mechanistic exploration, especially when combined with other genetic events that turn off probasin expressionNone,None. To overcome these shortcomings, we constructed a knock-in model of prostate-specificERGexpression that gives robust, uniformERGexpression throughout the mouse prostate. This model led us to the discovery thatERGreprograms the AR cistrome. These effects, in the context ofPtenloss which suppresses AR, restore AR transcriptional activity and activate transcriptional targets involved in cell death, inflammation, migration and angiogenesis that result in rapid onset, widely invasive prostate cancer. Similarly,ETV1also alters the AR-cistrome and AR-transcriptional activity inETV1-translocated,PTEN-negative prostate cancer cells. The findings reveal a previously unappreciated role for chromatin context inETS-mediated transformation and offer a potential explanation for the tissue-restricted nature ofETStranslocations. We generated a conditional mouse of theTMPRSS2-ERGtransgene knocked into theRosa26locus (R26None) (Supplementary Fig. 1). We crossedR26Nonewith prostate specificPb-Cre4mice to expressERGspecifically in the prostateNone. IHC against ERG or the IRES-linked EGFP showed that ERG was uniformly expressed in the ventral and dorsolateral lobes by 8 weeks and the anterior lobes by 3 months and that ERG did not affect AR expression (Fig. 1a,2c,Supplementary Fig. 2). We did not appreciate any differences in prostate histology or cellular proliferation (Ki67 staining) in either heterozygousPb-Cre4;R26None/+or homozygousPb-Cre4;R26Nonemice up to 1 year of age. Approximately 50% ofERGmice older than 1 year exhibited focal ventral lobe hyperplasia (Fig. 1b, c). We conclude that ERG alone, even in the context of robust and high level protein expression is insufficient to cause prostate cancerNone-None. Previously reported transgenic models ofERGexpression in aPtengermline heterozygous background show prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) that is patchy and variably penetrantNone,None,None. We crossedR26NonetoPtenNonemice to generate double homozygous mice (R26None;PtenNone). PtenNonemice developed highly penetrant and homogenous PIN that does not progress to grossly invasive disease. InPtenNone;R26Nonemice, invasive adenocarcinoma characterized by small irregular glandular structures comprised of malignant cells with large, pleiomorphic nuclei and pale cytoplasm developed adjacent to PIN by 8 weeks (Supplementary Fig. 3). By six months, approximately 80% ofPtenNone;R26Nonemice contained regions of adenocarcinoma with enlarged, hardened prostates (Fig. 2a, b). The tumor cells uniformly express nuclear ERG and AR, and display Akt activation (pAkt). While the invasive regions are highly proliferative, the proliferative index of PIN lesions inPtenNone;R26Noneprostates is only slightly higher than those inPtenNoneprostates (Fig. 2c), suggesting thatERGexpression within PIN does not significantly affect proliferation. Instead,ERGexpression may facilitate invasion and progression, as suggested in earlierin vitrostudiesNone,None. Human PIN retains a basal layer of p63 and cytokeratin 5 (CK5)-positive cells beneath a luminal layer of cytokeratin 8 (CK8)-positive cells whereas adenocarcinoma is characterized by irregular glandular structures that have lost the basal layer. InPtenNonePIN, p63 and CK5 are maintained in the basal cells and CK5 is ectopically expressed in some luminal cells, consistent with prior reports (Supplementary Fig. 4)None. PtenNone;R26Noneadenocarcinoma is invariably positive for CK8 and negative for p63 consistent with human adenocarcinoma. CK5 expression is variable and, when present, coincides with CK8 expression. CK5/8 double positive cells, coined as the "intermediate cells" are detectable in a subset of human prostate cancersNone. By 12 months, some mice develop foci of poorly differentiated carcinoma that maintain expression of AR, ERG, and CK8 and display patchy neuroendocrine differentiation demonstrated by Nestin staining (Fig. 2d,Supplementary Fig. 5). These patterns are reminiscent of human Gleason 5 cancer with focal neuroendocrine differentiation, in contrast to "small cell" cancer characterized by loss of AR and uniform neuroendocrine staining. PtenNone;R26Nonemice have shortened survival relative toPtenNonemice (Fig. 2e), with early deaths due to increased abdominal girth and penile prolapse. The robust and uniform expression of ERG inR26NoneandPtenNone;R26Nonemice provides an ideal model to explore the ERG cistrome and transcriptome under controlled conditions. ChIP-seq analysis identified 24,665 ERG peaks in prostate tissue fromR26Nonemice (Supplementary Table 1). While most ERG peaks reside in the enhancer regions, they were enriched at promoters (30% versus 3% in genome-wide background,p less than 2.2*10-16) (Supplementary Fig. 6), consistent with prior ERG ChIP-seqNone,None. ERG peaks were present in homologs of many well-characterized human ERG and ETV1 target genes such asDusp6,Tmprss2, andFkbp5that were defined inERG-positive VCAP andETV1-positive LNCaP cells (Fig. 3a,Supplementary Fig. 7, 8), giving us further confidence in the physiologic relevance of the mouse model. We observed similar distribution of ERG binding sites in thePtenloss background (Supplementary Fig. 9, 10). We next examined the genome-wide localization of AR by ChIP-seq. Strikingly, there was a greater than 4-fold increase in the number of AR peaks inR26None(14,889) compared toWTprostates (3,476) (Fig. 3b,Supplementary Table 1). The number of AR peaks was also increased inPtenNone;R26Noneprostates but to a lesser extent than inPtenNonemice. We validated increased AR binding at several enhancers using ChIP-qPCR of independent samples (Supplementary Fig. 11). We confirmed that the change in the AR cistrome was not due to difference in AR protein or circulating testosterone (Fig. 1a,Supplementary Fig. 12, 13). De novoMEME motif analysisNoneof ERG peaks identified the ETS core consensus GGAA motif with 5'-CC and 3'-GT bias identical to human prostate cancer cells. AR motif analysis showed that pre-existing sites inWTmice and new sites inR26Nonemice contained the identical AR motif (Supplementary Fig. 14). To discover potential cooperating transcription factors for AR binding, we performed DREME analysisNone. One distinguishing feature between conserved and new AR peaks was greater enrichment for GATA motifs in the new AR peaks and FOXA1 motifs in conserved AR peaks (Fig. 3c,Supplementary Table 2). This is of potential interest because GATA2 is essential for prostate development and cooperates with AR to modulate gene expressionNone,None. The percentage of AR and ERG peaks that physically co-localize inR26Nonemouse prostates was ?44% (Fig. 3d, left), which is highly significant and comparable to VCAP cells. Yet, new AR peaks have less overlap with ERG peaks than the conserved AR peaks (?40% versus ?60%,Fig. 3e, f), making it unlikely that ERG directly recruits AR to new sites. However, a large fraction of new AR sites (77%, p less than 1*10-20) map to genes containing ERG sites, raising the possibility of an ERG-mediated field effect that promotes AR binding, perhaps by functioning as a pioneer factor. Several classes of pioneer factors have been defined. One class, exemplified by the ETS factor PU.1, binds to closed chromatin regions and generatesde novoenhancers, characterized by H3K4me1, which in turn guide recruitment of other transcription factorsNone,None. Another class, exemplified by FOXA1, binds to pre-established H3K4me1 enhancer regions and instructs binding of additional transcriptional factors (e.g. AR) to both adjacent and distant pre-existing enhancer regionsNone,None,None. To determine if ERG resembles one of these classes of pioneer factors, we examined the distribution of H3K4me1. The collective distribution of H3K4me1 around ERG binding sites was similar between wild-type andR26Noneprostates, suggesting that ERG binds to pre-existing enhancers (Fig. 3g). Further, the collective distribution of H3K4me1 around both conserved and new AR peaks were also similar between wild-type andR26Noneprostates, suggesting that ERG expression helps guide AR to pre-existing enhancers (Fig. 3h). Interestingly, the normalized H3K4me1 ChIP-signal was consistently slightly higher inR26Nonemice for all three types of peaks (ERG, new AR and conserved AR), raising the possibility that ERG may strengthen pre-existing enhancers. Collectively, these data support a model whereby ERG reprograms the AR cistrome without significant changes in the K3K4me1 landscape. We examined ERG-induced transcriptome changes in prostates from 4-month oldR26Nonemice and littermate controls and found only 20 genes changed by 1.5-fold with a FDR less than 0.3 cutoff, as appreciated by a volcano plot (including a 16-fold increase in ERG transgene linked EGFP) (Supplementary Fig. 15a, Supplementary Table 3). However, in thePtenNonebackground,ERGexpression induced robust transcriptome changes, with greater than 800 genes significantly changed using the same criteria (Supplementary Fig. 15b, Supplementary Table 4). Principle component analysis of the 4 groups of mice showed that the first component is determined byPtenstatus and the second component is determined byERGstatus (Fig. 4a). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering showed thatPtenNoneprostates are clearly distinguished byERGstatus. Ptenintact prostates also clustered byERGstatus though less robustly, consistent with the subtle transcriptome alterations (Fig. 4b). Closer examination ofERG-induced gene expression changes (ERG Delta) in thePtenNoneversus thePtenNonebackground revealed thatERGgenerally induced the same directional transcriptome changes that are greatly amplified in magnitude byPtenloss (Fig. 4a, b). InPtenNoneprostates, both ERG up-regulated and ERG down-regulated genes were enriched with ERG and AR peaks (Supplementary Fig 16a, b). When we divided genes into those with only AR peaks, only ERG peaks, or both, only those with both were significantly enriched for regulation by ERG (Supplementary Fig. 16c-e). Among genes with AR peaks, those with "old" pre-existing AR peaks and those with "new" peaks found only in the setting of ERG expression are both enriched (Supplementary Fig. 16f, g). This data suggests that AR binding facilitates ERG-mediated transcriptional regulation. ERG-mediated upregulation of gene expression was also associated with increasing and widening of the H3K4me3 profile toward the gene body, a chromatin mark associated with active transcriptionNone, whereas ERG-mediated downregulation was associated narrowing and decreasing of the H3K4me3 peak (Supplementary Fig. 17a). To determine whether ERG-induced transcriptome changes in the context ofPtenloss resemble those observed inERG-positive human prostate cancer, we used gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA)None(Supplementary Table 5). Two ERG related human gene sets, one defined by genes upregulated inERG-positive compared toERG-negative human prostate cancer samplesNoneand a second defined by genes down-regulated afterERGknockdown in VCAP cellsNone, were highly enriched (Fig. 4c). Further evidence in support of the human relevance of the model comes from examination of specific genes such as adenosine monophosphate deaminase 3 (AMPD3), which is upregulated in both human and mouseERG-positive prostate cancers. Conversely, trefoil factor 3 (TFF3)Noneis highly expressed inERG-negative human prostate cancer andPtenNonemouse prostate and down-regulated inERG-positive human andPtenNone;R26Nonemouse prostate tumors (Fig. 4d,Supplementary Fig 17b). The transcriptome heatmap reveals six distinct blocks of genes whose expression patterns vary as a group across genotypes. 2 groups can be primarily defined by genes upregulated byPtenloss (Pup), one of which is downregulated by ERG (Pup/Edown) and the other further upregulated by ERG (Pup/Eup). Similarly, there are 2 groups primarily defined by genes downregulated byPtenloss (Pdown), one of which is further downregulated by ERG (Pdown/Edown) and the other upregulated by ERG (Pdown/Eup). Lastly, two additional groups of genes unchanged byPtenloss are primarily defined by up or downregulation by ERG (Eupor Edown). To understand the functional consequences of ERG expression, we performed pathway analysis of these distinct groups of genes using IPA and DAVID GONone(Supplementary Tables 6, 7). Among the most enriched processes in these groups are cell death (Pup/Edown), inflammation and migration (Pup/Eupgroup) and angiogenesis (Eup) (Fig. 4e). Identification of migration but not proliferation pathways is consistent with our histological evidence that ERG induces invasion without a change in Ki67 staining. The cell death finding agrees with prior work suggesting thatPtenloss induces oncogenic stressNone, which may be alleviated by ERG expression. Having demonstrated that ERG induces dramatic changes in the AR cistrome, we asked if this resulted in changes in the AR transcriptome. GSEA revealed that two gene sets, one defined by genes down-regulated in mouse prostate with castration and another by genes induced by androgen inERG-positive VCAP cells, were highly enriched by ERG expression in thePtenNonebackground (Fig. 5a). As expected from prior work,Ptenloss resulted in decreased expression of AR-regulated genes, as defined by castration experimentsNone,None. ERG expression had no significant effect on AR target genes inPtenintact mice but significantly restored AR transcriptional output in the setting ofPtenloss (Fig. 5b, c). Since AR may regulate a distinct transcriptome in the setting ofPtenloss, we performed a castration experiment ofPtenNoneandPtenNone;R26Nonemice (Supplementary Fig. 18). Expression profiling of the four groups of prostates show that genes downregulated by castration in the setting ofPtenloss are upregulated by ERG expression, including established AR target genes such as probasin (Pbsn),Nkx3-1, and beta-microseminoprotein (Msmb), all of which also correlate with the H3K4me3 profile that marks active transcription (Supplementary Fig. 19). To determine the interaction ofPtenloss and ETS expression in human prostate cancers, we turned to two large scale human prostate cancer gene expression data sets, one from the University of Michigan rapid autopsy series and one from the MSKCC prostatectomy seriesNone,None. In both datasets, tumors withPTENloss had a significantly decreased AR signature, consistent with prior reports. Further, in the setting ofPTENloss,ETS-positive tumors showed partial restoration of the AR signature (Fig. 5d). Thus, these analyses corroborate with experimental data thatETSoverexpression positively regulates theAR- transcriptome inPTENloss prostate cancer. We next asked if the effects of ERG on AR DNA binding and transcriptional output described here are observed with other ETS family proteins targeted by prostate cancer translocations. The LNCaP prostate cancer cell line harbors anETV1translocation andPTENlossNone. We performed ETV1 ChIP-seq in LNCaP cells and compared the binding sites with published ERG ChIP-seq data in VCAP cellsNone. ETV1 and ERG binding sites were highly similar, as 91% of ETV1 sites in LNCaP were bound by ERG in VCAP (Fig. 6a, see examples on3a,Supplementary Fig. 7, 8). Next, we examined the role of ETV1 in AR binding by performing AR ChIP-seq in LNCaP cells expressing anETV1-specific shRNA (ETV1sh2) or a scrambled controlNone. ETV1knockdown resulted in a striking ?90% decrease in the number of AR binding peaks (Fig. 6b, c,Supplementary Fig. 20). We validated this result by independent ChIP-qPCR experiments of thePSAandTMPRSS2enhancers with two differentETV1shRNAs and in the presence or absence of R1881 treatment (Supplementary Fig. 21). We next performed transcriptional profiling ofETV1knockdown using two shRNAs. ETV1knockdown reduced AR transcriptional activity measured both by AR output score and by GSEA which showed that the AR signature is the most enriched gene set (Fig. 6d, e,Supplementary Fig. 22, Supplementary Table 8). Thus, both ETV1 and ERG positively regulate AR binding and AR transcription in the context ofPTENloss. Previous transgenic models, while critical in establishingERG's oncogenic potential, are limited by the subtle phenotype and variable penetrance. Here we report a novelERGknock-in model with uniform transgene expression in all prostate epithelial cells that gives highly predictable, early onset invasive prostate cancer when combined withPtendeficiency. These characteristics make this a broadly useful new model for the prostate cancer research community for mechanistic and therapeutic studies ofERG-driven prostate cancer. An unanticipated finding is that ERG appears to function as a pioneer factor, causing dramatic changes in the AR cistrome. This property is not unique to ERG because knockdown ofETV1results in a similarly dramatic loss in AR binding sites. The large increase in AR binding sites seen inERG-expressing mice cannot be explained solely by co-recruitment of AR by ERG to adjacent binding sites. However, the fact that ?80% of the new AR sites map to genes that also contain ERG sites support a pioneer model whereby ERG causes local chromatin changes that facilitate AR binding to nearby but not adjacent sites. ChIP-seq studies of the H3K4me1 enhancer mark in prostate tissue from wild type mice establish that ERG primarily binds to pre-defined enhancers, presumably established during development of the genitourinary tract. At the transcriptional level, the primary consequence of theERG-driven changes in the AR cistrome is an increase in AR output, which is particularly evident inPtendeficient mice and inPTEN-negative human tumors. This requirement for additional signaling input to enhance the transcriptional effects of ERG is reminiscent of earlier work on the related ETS family protein ETV1 showing that KIT kinase activity amplifiesETV1transcriptional output in gastrointestinal stromal tumorsNone. Our conclusion that ERG enhances AR function contrasts with previous work showing that ERG suppresses AR functionNone,None. Potential explanations for these apparently contradictory findings include the fact that the earlier studies were conducted in VCAP cells, which arePTEN-intact and therefore may be less "sensitized" to theERG-effect onARtranscriptome. Even in VCAP cells, there is evidence that ERG serves as a pioneer factor at a number of sites for AR binding including at theSOX9geneNone. Further,ERGexpression may impair differentiation, which can manifest as reduced expression of classic AR target genes associated with terminal prostate differentiation. Further work that comprehensively assesses the AR transcriptome in various contexts should clarify this. In summary,ERGandETV1mediate context-dependent oncogenic transformation by influencing the prostate lineage-specific master regulator, AR, and priming the prostate epithelium to cooperate with aberrant upstream signaling in prostate oncogenesis. Based on the increasing number of mutant transcription factors and chromatin modifiers emerging from cancer genome sequencing efforts, we speculate that the mechanism of oncogenesis described here for prostate cancer may be generalizable to other cancer types. All mouse studies are approved by MSKCC IACUC under protocol 06-07-012. Pb-Cre4None, andPtenNoneNonemice were previously described and all in the C57B6 background. Rosa26 targeting is described in Srinivas et. al. Nonewith modifications (Supplementary Fig. 1). We started with with pBigT-invloxP (kind gift from Juan Pedro Martinez-Barbera) where the loxP sites were inverted in orientation to remove two sense ATG's that may aberrantly initiate translation prior to theERGgeneNone, and subsequently cloned theTMPRSS2-ERGcDNA containing non-coding exon 1 of human TMPRSS2 with exon 4 of ERGNoneand an IRES-nlsEGFP (Addgene plasmid 15037)Noneinto the polycloning site respectively. This vector, pBigT-invloxP-ERG-IRES-nlsEGFP was cloned into Rosa26-Pam1 (Addgene 15036)None. The vector was targeted into 129 ES cells and injected into C57B6 blastocysts. Genotyping was performed using the following primers: R26-TA-WT-3F (5'-TCCCGACAAAACCGAAAATC-3'), R26-WT-3R (5'-AAGCACGTTTCCGACTTGAG-3'), ERG Ex7F (5'-CAAAACTCTCCACGGTTAATGC-3'), ERG Ex10R (5'-GCACTGTGGAAGGAGATGGT-3') with wild-type band of 468 bp and targeted band of 205 bp. To initially characterize gene expression,Pb-Cre4;R26None+andPb-Cre4;R26Nonemice were generated through standard mouse breeding. To facilitate breeding, upon generation ofR26Nonehomozygous mice, subsequent crosses involvedPb-Cre4;R26Nonemales withR26Nonefemales that generated a 1:1 ratio ofCre+andCreNonemice. ChIP-seq and gene expression analysis were carried out inR26Nonehomozygous mice. To cross into thePtenconditional background, we crossedPb-Cre4;R26NonewithPtenNonemice and after two generations, obtainedPb-Cre4;PtenNone/+, PtenNone, and Pb-Cre4;PtenNone+;R26None, PtenNone;R26Nonemice. From these mice, subsequent breeding betweenPb-Cre4;PtenNone+males andPtenNonefemales generatedPb-Cre4;PtenNonemales (abbreviated asPtenNonein text and figures) and breeding betweenPb-Cre4;PtenNone+;R26Nonemales andPtenNone;R26Nonefemales generatedPb-Cre4;PtenNone;R26Nonemales (abbreviated asPtenNone;R26Nonein text and figures). To measure serum testosterone level, blood was obtained immediately after CO2 euthanasia via cardiac puncture and testosterone ELISA was performed using a KIT from ALPCO. Mouse prostate dissection was performed as describedNone. For isolation of chromatin and RNA forPtenwild-type mice, all prostate lobes were pooled. ForPtenNoneprostates, the ventral, lateral, and dorsal lobes were pooled as the anterior lobe was more cystic and frequently highly fibrotic. Mouse castration was performed as describedNoneand RNA isolation was carried out 48 hours after castration. To isolate chromatin from mouse prostate, prostates from 6-month old mice were minced using scissors, and crosslinked using 1% paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes. Sample was washed in PBS, resuspended in lysis buffer, and dounced in a Tenbroeck style tissue grounder prior to sonication and IP as previously describedNone. Chromatin isolation from LNCaP cells growing in FBS was performed as previously describedNone. For ETV1 knockdown experiments, chromatin was isolated 72-hours after lentiviral infection. ChIP-qPCR primers for humanKLK3,TMPRSS2were describedNone. Mouse ChIP-qPCR primers pairs are:Tmprss2enhancer (5'-GAGGCACTTTTTGCCCAGTG-3', 5'-CCAGGATGTGTCTGGGGAAC-3'),Fkbp5enhancer (5'-TGTGGCTGGCACATGAACTCGA-3', 5'-GCTGTATGCTCCCCACCCCC-3'), andNkx3-1enhancer (5'-TGTTGACATGGCTTCCTCGT-3', 5'-TGGTTTATCGCCGTACCTTT-3'). Next generation sequencing was performed either on an Illumina Genome Analyzer 2 or HiSeq2000 with 50 base-pair single reads. Reads were aligned to either the mouse genome (mm9) or the human genome (hg 18) using the ELAND alignment software within the Illumina Analysis Pipeline and duplicate read were eliminated for subsequent analysis. Peak calling was performed using MACS 1.4Nonecomparing IP chromatin with input chromatin. Based on RefSeq gene annotation, the resultant peaks were separated into promoter peaks (located within +/- 2 kb of a transcription start site (TSS)), promoter distal peaks (located from -50 kb of a transcription start to + 5kb of a transcription end), and otherwise intergenic peaks. Genes with one or more peaks in their promoter or promoter distal (also referred to as "enhancer") regions were considered as AR or ERG targets. The MEME software suiteNoneand DREMENonewere applied for motif analysis using 300-bp sequences centered on either AR or ERG peaks. ChIP-seq profiles are presented using Integrated Genome Browser software of SGR format files. For overlapping analysis of AR, ERG, H3K4me3, and H3K4me1 peaks, we defined two peaks overlap if they shared at least one base pair across their full peak spans, as detected by MACS. To isolate RNA from mouse prostates, freshly dissected 3-month old prostate tissue was immediately placed into Trizol and homogenized using a FastPrep-24 instrument with Lysing Matrix A (MP Biomedicals). After phase separation, the RNA fraction was further purified using RNAEasy Mini kit. Gene expression profiling was performed as describedNoneusing the Illumina MouseWG-6 v2.0 Expression BeadChip (4-month oldWT,R26None,PtenNoneandPtenNone;R26None) and Illumina MouseRef-8 v2.0 Expression BeadChip (6-month old intact and castratePtenNoneandPtenNone;R26None). Expression analysis was performed using Partek Genomics Suite. Significantly changed probes induced by ERG expression were defined as genes with a 1.5-fold change and a Benjamini-Hochberg FDR 0.3. For gene expression profiling of LNCaP cells, cells were infected using a scrambled or two ETV1-specific shRNAs in the PKO.1 backboneNonein triplicates. RNA was harvested 72-hours after infection and profiled using Illumina HT-12 microarray. To obtain the AR signature score, the normalized expression of a set of canonical AR-regulated genes was summedNone. Gene ontology analysis of ERG-regulated gene sets were performed using DAVIDNoneand Ingenuity IPA (http://www.ingenuity.com). Gene set enrichment analysis was performed using the JAVA program (http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea) as describedNone. For ERG profile inPtenloss mouse prostate, genes were ranked from most upregulated to most downregulated inPtenNone;R26Nonemice compared toPtenNonemice. For ETV1 profile in LNCaP cells, genes were ranked by the mean changed by two shETV1 hairpins compared to scrambled hairpin. We used the gene sets in the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) and added the following: CARVER_CASTRATION_UP and CARVER_CASTRATION_DN defined by genes upregulated and downregulated greater than 1.5-fold in the mouse prostate (GSE24691), TAYLOR_PCA_ERG_UP defined by genes with greater than 1.5-fold higher expression inERG-positive compared to ERG-negative tumors (GSE21034)None, VCAP_siERG_DN defined by genes downregulated greater than 2-fold by siRNA against ERG, VCAP_R1881_UP defined by genes upregulated greater than 3-fold by R1881 treatmentNone, and AR_SIG is a set of canonical AR upregulated genesNone.To integrate transcriptome with cistrome, we analyzed the gene that was both present in the Illumina MouseWG-6 v2.0 microarray and mouse RefSeq (19,260 genes) and compared the percent of all 19,260 of these genes with ERG and AR peaks with perturbed genes with ERG or AR peaks. We analyzed two human prostate cancer datasets, a rapid autopsy series from University of Michigan (GSE35988) employing Agilent 44K microarray and MSKCC prostatectomy series employing Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST Array (GSE21034). PTENloss is defined,ERGandETV1status are defined as shown (Supplementary Fig. 23). AR signature score of each sample is the sum of normalized expression of each gene in a canonical AR signatureNonewith the exception ofTMRPSS2because manyETS-positive tumors contain a genomic deletion ofTMPRSS2due to genomic fusion with the ETS partner. The following antibodies were used for IHC, WB, and ChIP: rabbit AR (Epitomics clone ER179(2)), rabbit ERG (Epitomics clone EPR3864), rabbit ETV1None, rabbit histone H3K4me1 (Abcam ab8895), rabbit AKT (Cell Signaling #4691), rabbit phospho-AKT (Cell Signaling #4060), rabbit Ki67 (Vector Labs #VP-K451), rabbit mouse smooth muscle actin (Sigma A5228), chicken EGFP (Abcam ab13970), mouse beta-Actin (clone AC-15, Sigma), mouse GAPDH (clone 1D4, Santa Cruz), rabbit p63 (Epitomics clone EPR5701), rabbit CK5 (Covance), rabbit CK8 (Covance), and rabbit nestin (Abcam). Tissue paraffin embedding, sectioning, and H E staining was performed by MSKCC core facility. Immunohistochemistry was performed by the MSKCC molecular cytology core using a Ventana Discovery XT. To generate lysates for Western blotting, tissue was homologized in RIPA buffer using FastPrep-24 system with Lysing Matrix A (MP Biomedicals). All statistical comparisons between two groups were performed by Graphpad Prism software used two-tailed unpaired t-test. Kaplan Meier analysis was performed by Graphpad Prism using Log-rank Mantel-Cox test.
