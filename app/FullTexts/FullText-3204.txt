Obesity is a risk factor for insulin resistance (IR), which can lead to progressive dysfunction and loss of pancreatic beta-cells resulting in overt type 2 diabetes (T2D) (1,2), although beta-cell dysfunction may arise independently, as it can precede the onset of IR (3). Adipose tissue inflammation plays a critical role in obesity-related IR (4), and a similar process associated with inflammatory cell infiltration in the endocrine pancreas has been linked to beta-cell loss and the development of T2D (5). Endocannabinoids (ECs) are endogenous ligands of cannabinoid receptors (cannabinoid-1 receptor [CB1R] and cannabinoid-2 receptor) that also mediate the effects of marijuana (6). The EC/CB1R system is overactive in obesity/metabolic syndrome (7,8), and blockade or genetic deletion of CB1R mitigates diet-induced obesity and its metabolic complications, including IR and T2D (reviewed by Mazier et al. [9]). CB1R blockade has similar beneficial effects in people with metabolic syndrome (10) or T2D (11) but can cause psychiatric side effects due to blocking CB1R in the central nervous system. ECs can inhibit hepatic insulin sensitivity via CB1R in the central nervous system (12) but can also inhibit insulin signaling directly via CB1R in adipose tissue (13), skeletal muscle (14), liver (15), and adipose tissue macrophages (16), and these latter targets account for the efficacy of peripherally restricted CB1R antagonists in mitigating IR (17,18). Macrophage CB1Rs also play a prominent role in the progressive loss of beta-cell function in Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) rats, a rodent model of T2D. The pancreatic islets of adult ZDF rats have reduced numbers of beta-cells and are heavily infiltrated with proinflammatory macrophages expressing high levels of CB1R and the Nlrp3/Asc inflammasome (19). Peripheral CB1R blockade, macrophage depletion, or macrophage-specific knockdown of CB1R prevented these changes and preserved normoglycemia (19), which further illustrates the anti-inflammatory effect of CB1R blockade. Chronic CB1R blockade promotes a shift in the polarization of macrophages from proinflammatory to anti-inflammatory (19) and also reduces macrophage infiltration of diabetic islets by inhibiting the secretion of MCP-1 (or CCL2) (19,20). ZDF rats also develop severe diabetic nephropathy associated with a loss of glomerular podocytes without significant macrophage infiltration or increase in Nlrp3/ASC inflammasome expression in the kidney (21). Together, these findings raise questions of whether there is an obligatory role for ECs in the development of T2D and its renal complication in the ZDF model. To this end, we have generated CB1R-deficient rats on a ZDF background (ZDF-Cnr1 rats) and analyzed glycemic functions and renal parameters, as well as their modulation by adoptive bone marrow (BM) transfer. Our results indicate the obligatory requirement for peripheral CB1Rs in both T2D and diabetic nephropathy, with CB1R in BM-derived cells required for beta-cell loss and the development of hyperglycemia, but not for podocyte loss and the resulting nephropathy. Interferon regulatory factor-5 (IRF5) was recently implicated in polarizing macrophages toward the inflammatory phenotype (22), whereas mice with global or macrophage-specific deletion ofIrf5that were maintained on a high-fat diet remain insulin sensitive and display beneficial expansion of subcutaneous adipose tissue (23). Because of the unexpected similar expansion of subcutaneous but not visceral fat tissue observed in ZDF-Cnr1 rats, we explored the involvement of IRF5 in beta-cell loss via CB1R-mediated inflammatory signaling. Here we report that IRF5 mediates CB1R-induced cytokine secretion and the resulting beta-cell loss, whereas CB1R-induced CCL2 production and macrophage transmigration is independent of IRF5 and involves activation of the alpha-isoform of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK). Animal protocols were approved by our institutional animal care and use committee. Male ZDF rats and their lean controls were obtained from Charles River Laboratories, housed individually under a 12-h light/dark cycle, and fed ad libitum a standard laboratory diet (STD; NIH-31 Rodent Diet). A pair of zinc finger nucleases (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was designed to cleave within the coding region of theCnr1gene, with the target site 5'-TACCACTTCATCGGCAGCctggcaGTGGCCGACCTCCTG-3' (zinc finger nuclease binding site set in capital letters). Identified founders carried an 11-base pair (BP) deletion located between T17193to C17203in the genomic DNA sequence. Cnr1andFagenes were amplified as described inSupplementary Table 2. JD5037 was synthesized and its pharmacological properties analyzed as described previously (18). CP-55,940 was obtained from the NIDA Drug Supply Program (Research Triangle Park, NC). N-arachidonoylethanolamine (or anandamide [AEA]), arachidonoyl-2'-chloroethylamine (ACEA) and SP600125 were purchased from Cayman (Ann Arbor, MI). SB202190 was from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). All other chemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich. Blood glucose levels were determined using the Elite Glucometer (Bayer, Pittsburgh, PA). Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase, free fatty acid (FFA), total cholesterol, triglycerides, insulin, proinsulin, C-peptide, glucagon, leptin, and adiponectin were quantified as described previously (19). IGF-I content was quantified with a Mouse/Rat IGF-I ELISA Kit (R D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), whereas growth hormone was detected using a Rat/Mouse ELISA Kit (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Serum and urine creatinine, urea, and albumin concentrations and glomerular filtration rate were determined as described previously (21). Glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity tests were performed as described previously (24). HOMA-IR was calculated as follows: fasting insulin (muU/mL) * fasting glucose (mg/dL)/405 (25). Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) was determined as described previously (19). [35S]GTPgammaS binding assay was performed as described (26). Whole-body irradiation was conducted as described previously (27). Six-week-old male ZDF rats received 1 Gy total body irradiation from a137Cs source. BM cells from ZDF and ZDF-Cnr1 donor rats were obtained as described previously (27). After a 2-h rest after irradiation, recipient rats were injected with 108BM cells via a tail vein. Animals were then rested for 2 weeks, and survivors with proper chimerism were used for experiments. DNA was isolated from blood using a DNeasy kit (69504; Qiagen, Germantown, MD). Cnr1expression was detected using the genotyping protocol. Blood samples were analyzed in an automated Hemavet blood analyzer (Drew Scientific Group, Miami Lakes, FL). Pancreas, kidney, and adipose tissue were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned (4-mum sections) onto glass slides. Renal and adipose tissue histology were evaluated after hematoxylin-eosin and periodic acid Schiff staining. The antibodies used are listed inSupplementary Table 3. Slides were revealed by using the appropriate Elite ABC HRP (horseradish peroxidase)/diaminobenzediene (DAB) system (Vector Laboratories), counterstained with hematoxylin-eosin (Gills Formula; Vector Laboratories), or by secondary antibodies coupled to Alexa Fluor 488, 555, or 647. DAB slides were analyzed using an Olympus BX41 microscope, whereas fluorescent staining was analyzed using a Zeiss LSM700 confocal microscope. Immunopositivity was quantified using ImageJ software. Adipocyte diameters were evaluated digitally in light microscopy images of adipose tissue sections (n= 6-7 pictures per animal, three animals per group) using ImageJ software. TUNEL staining in pancreatic islet was performed using the Click-it TUNEL Alexa Fluor Imaging Assay from ThermoFisher Scientific (C10245). Islets were isolated, and beta-cell mass was determined as described previously (19). Caspase-1 activity was determined using the Caspase-1 Assay Kit (Fluorometric) from Abcam (ab39412); interleukin (IL)-1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) proteins were measured using the Rat Quantikine ELISA Kit (R D Systems). Human monocytic THP-1 cells were grown according to the recommendation of the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Cells were differentiated at 1.5-2 * 106cells/well (35 mm) with 50 ng/mL phorbol myristic acid (P8139; Sigma-Aldrich) for 4 days. THP-1-derived macrophages were incubated in RPMI 1640 free of phorbol myristic acid, supplemented with 10% FBS (30-2020; ATCC), 50 mug/mL streptomycin, and 50 units/mL penicillin (30-2300; ATCC) for 24 h at 37 degrees C, under an atmosphere of 5% CO2in air prior to treatment. IL-1beta, IL-18, IL-6, CCL2, and TNF-alpha protein concentrations were determined using ELISA kits from R D Systems according to the manufacturer protocol. Aliquots of peritoneally elicited macrophages (PEC) or THP-1 cells were exposed for 48 h to siRNA listed inSupplementary Table 4. Control siRNAs were designed using the C911 technique (28). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled glucan shells were prepared as described previously (29), and 8-week-old ZDF rats were then injected intraperitoneally every other day for 12 days with 6.17 mg/kg glucan-encapsulated siRNA particles (GeRPs) loaded with 308 nmol/kg endoporter and 0.410 mg/kg siRNA (Supplementary Table 4). Cells were treated with pertussis toxin (PTX) 100 ng/mL, SB202190 25 mumol/L, SP600125 25 mumol/L, JD5037 100 nmol/L, and AEA and ACEA 1-10 mumol/L. Western blotting analyses were conducted as described previously (30), and antibodies used are listed inSupplementary Table 5. Total RNA extraction, reverse transcription, and real-time PCR were performed as described previously (19). If not otherwise specified, values are expressed as the mean +/- SEM. Data were analyzed by Studentttest or by one-way ANOVA followed by the Tukey-Kramer post hoc test. Time-dependent variables were analyzed, and results in multiple groups were compared by two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni test. Significance was set atP less than 0.05. ZDF rats with a global knockout of CB1R (ZDF-Cnr1 rats) retained the mutation of the leptin receptor gene characteristic of Zucker fatty rats and ZDF rats and had an 11-BP deletion in theCnr1genomic DNA, as demonstrated by genotyping (Fig. 1None). Of note, theCnr1mutation led to a frameshift in the open reading frame resulting in a premature stop codon. As a result, CB1R protein was undetectable in the brain of ZDF-Cnr1 rats (Fig. 1None). In addition, the CB1R agonist CP-55940 increased [35S]GTPgammaS binding in plasma membranes prepared from ZDF but not from ZDF-Cnr1 brains (Fig. 1None), confirming the absence of CB1R signaling in the knockouts. ZDF-Cnr1 rats displayed lower food intake throughout the observation period and a slower rate of weight gain compared with their ZDF littermates but reached a similar body weight by the age of 26 weeks (Fig. 1None). Interestingly, the inguinal fat mass (often referred to as subcutaneous fat) was significantly larger in ZDF-Cnr1 than in ZDF rats, whereas the epididymal and perirenal fat pads, representing visceral fat, were of similar size (Fig. 1None). This was associated with a striking increase in the diameter of inguinal adipocytes in ZDF-Cnr1 versus ZDF rats, whereas an analogous difference in the size of perirenal adipocytes was much smaller (Supplementary Fig. 1). Characterization of ZDF-Cnr1 rats. A: Representative gel analysis forLeprmutation andCnr1mutation. B: CB1R immunoblot from a ZDF vs. ZDF-Cnr1 brain. C: [35S]GTPgammaS binding assay using membranes from ZDF vs. ZDF-Cnr1 brains; columns and bars represent the mean +/- SEM from five separate preparations. ***P less than 0.005 relative basal activity. D: Daily food intake and body weight measurements from 6 to 26 weeks of age in lean controls, ZDF rats, and ZDF-Cnr1 rats. Points and bars represent the mean +/- SEM from lean control (open circles), ZDF (light blue circles), and ZDF-Cnr1 (blue triangles) rats. E: Weight of inguinal, epididymal, and perirenal fat pads in lean (open columns,n= 10), ZDF (light blue,n= 10), and ZDF-Cnr1 rats (blue,n= 10). F: Serum ALT, triglyceride, FFA, and total cholesterol levels. G: Serum concentration of IGF-I, growth hormone, adiponectin, and leptin levels. Columns and bars represent the mean +/- SEM. Significant differences from values in lean controls (*) or ZDF rats (#), * or #P less than 0.05, ** or ##P less than 0.01, *** or ###P less than 0.001. BW, body weight; WT, wild type. The elevated serum levels of ALT, triglycerides, FFAs, and total cholesterol in ZDF rats were normalized in ZDF-Cnr1 rats (Fig. 1None). Additionally, the absence ofCnr1resulted in normalization of the reduced plasma levels of growth hormone and IGF-I observed in ZDF rats (Fig. 1None). The hypoadiponectinemia of ZDF rats was reversed beyond the levels in lean controls, whereas the hyperleptinemia was unaffected by the deletion ofCnr1(Fig. 1None). ZDF rats develop extreme hyperglycemia due to beta-cell loss by the age of 12-14 weeks (19). In contrast, ZDF-Cnr1 rats remained euglycemic for up to 26 weeks of age (Fig. 2None). At 8 weeks (i.e., before hyperglycemia starts to develop in ZDF rats), ZDF-Cnr1 rats were more glucose tolerant than ZDF rats (Fig. 2None). In contrast, the two strains displayed equal IR in the insulin sensitivity test (Fig. 2None), as is also reflected by the similar degree of hyperinsulinemia and similar increases in HOMA-IR (Fig. 2None). Despite their similar IR, ZDF-Cnr1 rats have improved beta-cell function, as reflected in the preserved GSIS, whereas ZDF rats were nonresponsive to a glucose challenge (Fig. 2None). Glycemic control and beta-cell status in lean control, ZDF, and ZDF-Cnr1 rats. A: Evolution of blood glucose from 6 to 26 weeks of age in lean (open circles), ZDF (light blue circles), and ZDF-Cnr1 (blue triangles) rats. B: Glucose tolerance tests conducted at 8 weeks of age, as described inNone. C: Insulin sensitivity tests (ISTs) at 8 weeks, as described inresearch and design methods. D: Serum insulin and HOMA-IR at 8 weeks. E: GSIS indicated by the yellow segments, determined at 8 weeks, as described inNone. Columns and bars represent mean +/- SEM (n= 8-10 rats/group). Significant difference from corresponding value in lean (white bars) (*P less than 0.05, **P less than 0.01, ***P less than 0.001) or ZDF rats (light blue bars) (#P less than 0.05, ###P less than 0.001). AUC, area under the curve. ZDF-Cnr1 rats exhibited normal plasma levels of glucagon in contrast to the hyperglucagonemia of ZDF rats (Fig. 3None), which may contribute to the improved glucose tolerance in the presence of IR in ZDF-Cnr1 rats. Also, plasma proinsulin, insulin, and C-peptide levels were higher whereas the proinsulin/insulin ratio was significantly lower in ZDF-Cnr1 than in ZDF littermates (Fig. 3None), which is indicative of improved beta-cell function and survival. The protection of beta-cells in ZDF-Cnr1 rats was further confirmed by the higher islet insulin content (Fig. 3None). Of note, the strong infiltration of islets with CD68+macrophages previously observed in younger, 14-week-old ZDF rats (19) was absent by the age of 26 weeks (Fig. 3None), probably due to the nearly complete destruction of islets by this age. Nevertheless, in a few remaining identifiable islets we could still observe strong infiltration of CD68+macrophages (Fig. 3None, third row). In contrast, ZDF-Cnr1 rats maintained an almost normal islet structure without prominent CD68+macrophage infiltration and had significantly larger beta-cell mass than ZDF littermates (Fig. 3None). The higher beta-cell mass inversely correlated with beta-cell death, as reflected by the increased number of TUNEL-positive cells in ZDF compared with ZDF-Cnr1 islets (Supplementary Fig. 2None). Hormonal parameters and beta-cell status in lean, ZDF, and ZDF-Cnr1 rats. A: Serum hormone levels, proinsulin/insulin ratio, and HOMA-IR, determined at 26 weeks of age in lean (open), ZDF (light blue), and ZDF-Cnr1 rats (blue). B: Islet insulin and CD68+cell content determined by immunohistochemistry after killing of the rats at 26 weeks. The bottom (seventh) panel illustrates a rare remaining islet heavily infiltrated by CD68+cells. C: beta-Cell mass, determined as described inNone. Columns and bars are the mean +/- SEM from 8-12 animals/group. Scale bar, 100 mum. *P less than 0.05, **P less than 0.01, ***P less than 0.001 compared to lean control; #P less than 0.05, ##P less than 0.01, ###P less than 0.001 compared to ZDF rats. CB1R is a major effector in the development of diabetic nephropathy, and treatment of ZDF rats with a peripheral CB1R antagonist prevented or reversed this complication (21). Diabetic nephropathy, evident in 26-week-old ZDF rats by robust deterioration in renal parameters, was largely absent in ZDF-Cnr1 rats, as reflected in normalization of the albuminuria, glomerular filtration rate, and blood urea nitrogen (Supplementary Fig. 3None). Correspondingly, ZDF-Cnr1 rats were protected from podocyte loss, as demonstrated by Wilms tumor 1 immunostaining (Supplementary Fig. 3None). Furthermore, ZDF rats displayed glomerular enlargement and early mesangial matrix expansion that were absent in lean control or ZDF-Cnr1 rats. The pronounced albuminuria of ZDF rats was associated with prominent tubular protein resorption droplets and occasional tubular dilatation with proteinaceous casts. Again, no such changes were observed in ZDF-Cnr1 rats (Supplementary Fig. 3None). Since macrophages are derived from BM myeloid precursors, we used the irradiation-BM transplantation (BMT) approach to test whether the lifelong beta-cell protection in ZDF-Cnr1 rats is due to the absence of CB1R in macrophages. For total body radiation exposure from a137Cs source, 1 Gy was the dose high enough to eliminate all circulating white blood cells without being lethal for at least 7 days after irradiation (Supplementary Fig. 4). Also, recipient rats needed at least 108donor BM cells to ensure survival. Animals were therefore irradiated at 6 weeks of age and transplanted 2 h after irradiation with 108BM cells pooled from three donor animals. Two weeks later, white blood cells were collected and DNA was extracted to verify the donor genotype. Five of seven recipients survived in each group, with all survivors achieving the expected chimerism (Fig. 4None). CB1R ablation in myeloid cells protects ZDF rats from hyperglycemia. A: Time line for whole-body irradiation/BM transfer; genotyping by agarose gel chromatography of white blood cells (WBCs) from ZDF rats receiving ZDF BM (WTBM) or ZDF-KO BM (KOBM), with the 113-BP and 102-BP amplicons indicatingCnr1+/+andCnr1-/-genotype, respectively. B: Evolution of blood glucose and serum levels of insulin and C-peptide along with body weight and mean weekly food intake at 20 weeks in ZDF rats receiving wild-type BM (green) orCnr1-/-BM (purple).

D: Fluorescence immunohistochemistry of insulin, CB1Rs, CD68, and colocalization analyzed by confocal microscopy. E: Increased insulin and decreased CD68 and CCL2 content of islets from ZDF rats receivingCnr1-/-compared with wild-type ZDF BM. Columns and bars are the mean +/- SEM fromn= 5 animals/group. Scale bar, 100 mum. **P less than 0.01, ***P less than 0.001 relative to values in ZDF rats receiving wild-type BM (green columns). BMT from ZDF donors to ZDF recipients tested for genotype-independent effects of irradiation and BMT. Recipients developed progressive hyperglycemia from 14 weeks on, reaching a plateau at 600 mg/dL by week 20 (Fig. 4None). The extent and rate of development of hyperglycemia were similar to those in control ZDF rats (dashed line), but its onset was delayed by 6 weeks, corresponding to the time it takes for the transferred cells to repopulate the irradiated BM and peripheral tissues (27). In contrast, ZDF rats receiving BM from ZDF-Cnr1 donors remained normoglycemic throughout the entire 20-week observation period and maintained higher plasma insulin and C-peptide levels compared with rats receiving ZDF BM (Fig. 4None). Interestingly, there was no difference in food intake or body weight between the two groups (Fig. 4None). CB1R protein was readily detectable postmortem in the BM of recipients of ZDF BM but was absent in recipients of ZDF-Cnr1 BM. As expected, CB1R was present at similar high levels in brain samples from both groups (Fig. 4None). Furthermore, CB1R highly colocalized with CD68+macrophages in the islets of ZDF rats transplanted with ZDF BM, whereas there were fewer CD68+cells and no detectable CB1Rs in islets of recipients of ZDF-Cnr1 BM (Fig. 4None). The absence of CB1Rs in hematopoietic cells was associated with higher pancreatic insulin content, normal pancreatic islet architecture, and reduced CD68+macrophage infiltration, most likely due to reduced levels of the chemoattractant protein CCL2 (Fig. 4None). beta-Cells in ZDF islets produce CCL2 (31,32) (Supplementary Fig. 2None), whereas the dramatically higher CCL2 expression in islets of ZDF rats transplanted with wild-type compared withCnr1-/-BM (Fig. 4None) suggests that transmigrating macrophages contribute to CCL2 secretion, as also supported by the ability of cultured macrophages to secrete CCL2 (see below) (Figs. 5and6). Role of MAP kinases in CB1R-induced chemokine and cytokine secretion by rat peritoneal macrophages (A-D) or THP-1 cells (E-G). A: Western blot analysis of phosphorylation of p38MAPK, JNK2, or ERK1/2 by 5 mumol/L AEA or 5 mumol/L ACEA in the presence or absence of 100 nmol/L JD5037 in three representative experiments; quantitation by densitometry.

Columns and bars are the mean +/- SEM from four independent experiments. Ctrl, control. CB1R regulation ofIrf5expression and its role in beta-cell loss in vivo.

D: ACEA-induced increase inIRF5expression is not affected byMAPK14knockdown. E: Effects ofIrf5knockdown onCnr1mRNA and on chemokine and cytokine secretion induced by 5 mumol/L ACEA in aliquots of 106rat peritoneal macrophages. Points/columns and bars are the mean +/- SEM from six rats/group. Significant differences from values in Veh (*) or Veh + ACEA groups (#). *P less than 0.05; **P less than 0.01; ***P less than 0.001; ##P less than 0.01; ###P less than 0.001. In contrast, adoptive transfer ofCnr1-/-BM did not influence the dyslipidemia (Supplementary Table 2) or the development of diabetic nephropathy (Supplementary Fig. 5None), including the loss of Wilms tumor 1-positive podocytes (Supplementary Fig. 5None). Next, we analyzed the CB1R signaling pathways that mediate the diabetogenic functions of macrophages (19). The stimulation of rat PECs with the physiological CB1R agonist AEA (5 mumol/L) or its stable analog ACEA (5 mumol/L) activated p38MAPK and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) 2 without any detectable change in extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation (Fig. 5None). CB1R activation reduced STAT3 phosphorylation, a known corollary of M1 polarization (33), which was inversely related to p38MAPK activation (Fig. 5None). ACEA also induced the secretion of the cytokines IL-1beta and TNF-alpha and the chemokine CCL2, but failed to affect IL-6 production (Fig. 5None). SB202190, a potent inhibitor of p38MAPKalpha and p38MAPKbeta, suppressed the secretion of CCL2 below control levels but did not affect TNF-alpha secretion, and a partial reduction of CB1R-evoked IL-1beta secretion was not statistically significant (Fig. 5None). The JNK1/2/3 inhibitor SP600125, while fully abolishing c-Jun phosphorylation (data not shown), was only effective in inhibiting the ACEA-evoked CCL2 secretion (Fig. 5None). The effects of ACEA on PEC secretory responses were fully abolished by the CB1R inverse agonist JD5037 (Fig. 5None) and were similarly inhibited by siRNA-mediated selective knockdown ofCnr1(Fig. 5None). In the macrophage-differentiated human monocytic cell line THP-1, silencingCNR1abolished ACEA-induced p38MAPK activation (Fig. 5None) and TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and CCL2 secretion (Fig. 5None). Knocking downMAPK14(encoding p38MAPKalpha), but notMAPK11(encoding p38MAPKbeta), completely blocked ACEA-induced secretion of CCL2 and significantly reduced the secretion of IL-1beta but, again, failed to influence ACEA-induced TNF-alpha secretion (Fig. 5NoneandNone). Thus, CB1R activation in macrophages engages p38MAPKalpha to induce CCL2, but not TNF-alpha, secretion and partially contributes to IL-1beta secretion. Prompted by the similar selective expansion of subcutaneous, but not visceral, fat tissue in ZDF-Cnr1 rats (Fig. 1None) and in mice deficient in the proinflammatory transcription factor Irf5 (see Introduction), we explored the involvement of IRF5 in CB1R-mediated inflammatory signaling and beta-cell loss. Irf5gene expression was robustly increased in pancreatic islets isolated from ZDF compared with lean rats, whereas there was no such increase in islets of ZDF-Cnr1 rats or in islets of ZDF rats chronically treated with JD5037 (Fig. 6None). The involvement of CB1R was further confirmed in PECs isolated from wild-type mice, exposure of which to 1 mumol/L ACEA induced a threefold to fourfold increase inIrf5mRNA, with no such effect in PECs fromCnr1-/-mice (Fig. 6None). Furthermore, in rat PECs, 1 mumol/L ACEA increasedIrf5mRNA twofold, an effect blocked by JD5037 or PTX but not by SB202190 or SP600125 (Fig. 6None). Thus, CB1R regulatesIrf5expression via Gi/o-mediated inhibition of adenylate cyclase rather than activation of MAP kinases. In THP-1 macrophages, 1 mumol/L ACEA also caused an approximately twofold increase inIRF5mRNA, and a similar effect was seen in THP-1 cells with siRNA-mediated knockdown ofMAPK14, confirming the lack of involvement of p38MAPKalpha (Fig. 6None). SiRNA-mediated knockdown ofIrf5in rat PECs inhibited the ACEA-induced secretion of both TNF-alpha and IL-1beta but had no effect on CCL2 secretion orCnr1expression (Fig. 6None), suggesting a requirement for IRF5 in CB1R-mediated cytokine production. To explore the potential role of the CB1R/Gi/o/IRF5 signaling cascade in the loss of beta-cell function in ZDF rats, 8-week-old ZDF rats were chronically treated with GeRP containing siRNA against ratIrf5, a technique that allows selective knockdown of target genes in phagocytic macrophages in vivo (19,34). We first optimizedIrf5siRNAs and selected one that yielded greater than 90% knockdown ofIrf5gene expression in rat PECs after 48 h (Fig. 7None). ZDF rats were then treated intraperitoneally every other day for 12 days with GeRPs containing control siRNA orIrf5siRNA. ZDF rats treated with control siRNA developed progressive hyperglycemia, whereas those receivingIrf5siRNA maintained their pretreatment blood glucose level and also retained significantly higher plasma insulin and C-peptide levels (Fig. 7None). beta-Cell protection was further indicated by the higher insulin content of islets fromIrf5siRNA-treated rats compared with control siRNA-treated rats (Fig. 7None). As expected,Irf5knockdown significantly reduced Irf5 protein abundance in islets, whereas the number of CD68+macrophages and CCL2 protein levels were similar in the two groups, indicating a lack of IRF5 involvement in CCL2 secretion (Fig. 7None). Similarly,Irf5knockdown did not affectCnr1,CD68, andCcl2mRNA levels in islets (Fig. 7None) but resulted in a greater than 90% decrease in TNF-alpha content (Fig. 7None), accompanied by significant decreases inPycardandNlrp3gene expression, caspase-1 activity, and IL-1beta content (Fig. 7None). Furthermore, macrophage-specific in vivo knockdown ofIrf5resulted in an increased in CD3+T lymphocytes (Supplementary Fig. 6None) associated with a decrease in TH1 markers (Supplementary Fig. 6None) and an increase in TH2 markers (Supplementary Fig. 6None), without a change in the TH17 response (Supplementary Fig. 6None). Additionally,Irf5knockdown did not affectIl12p40orIl23expression but did increaseIl10expression (Supplementary Fig. 6None).

Islet inflammation is a contributing factor to the progression of compensated IR into insulin-dependent T2D, and CB1R on proinflammatory macrophages play a prominent role in diabetic insulitis and loss of beta-cell function in the ZDF model of T2D (19). To test the developmental role of CB1R in T2D, we generated CB1R-deficient rats on a ZDF background. Here we report that ZDF-Cnr1 rats are as hyperinsulinemic and insulin resistant as ZDF rats, but they are protected from the loss of beta-cell function and consequently remain normoglycemic and are also protected from the associated nephropathy. Furthermore, adoptive transfer of ZDF-Cnr1 BM to ZDF recipients replicates the preservation of beta-cells and normoglycemia seen in ZDF-Cnr1 rats, but does not mitigate the loss of glomerular podocytes and the associated nephropathy. This provides strong evidence that CB1Rs in BM-derived macrophages are both necessary and sufficient for the development of T2D but do not play a role in diabetic nephropathy in this model. Furthermore, we demonstrate for the first time the key role of IRF5, the master regulator of inflammatory polarization of macrophages (22), as a downstream signaling molecule mediating CB1R-induced cytokine release by macrophages in vitro and the diabetogenic effect CB1R activation in vivo. ZDF-Cnr1 rats remain normoglycemic for up to 26 weeks of age and do not display the macrophage infiltration of islets and the associated loss of beta-cell function observed in diabetic ZDF rats. The elevated levels of plasma FFA, TG, and total cholesterol, as well as the hypoadiponectemia are also normalized in ZDF-Cnr1 rats, which is in agreement with the documented role of CB1R in these metabolic disturbances (17). Finally, ZDF-Cnr1 rats are protected from diabetic nephropathy, as reflected by normal parameters of renal function. Interestingly, the hyperphagia of ZDF rats is also prevented by the knockout ofCnr1, indicating that the hyperphagia in leptin deficiency requires intact CB1R signaling. The lower food intake of ZDF-Cnr1 rats was associated with a somewhat slower early weight gain (Fig. 1None), which could affect insulin sensitivity. However,Cnr1deletion protected beta-cells and preserved beta-cell function without affecting the IR of ZDF rats. Furthermore, adoptive transfer of CB1R-deficient BM to ZDF rats prevented hyperglycemia and beta-cell loss without affecting food intake or body weight (Fig. 4None). Thus, CB1R-mediated effects on beta-cell function are unrelated to changes in food intake or body weight. The absence of hyperglycemia and beta-cell loss in ZDF rats transplanted withCnr1-/-BM is not due to the process of BMT per se, because transferring wild-type ZDF BM to wild-type ZDF recipients did not prevent the full development of hyperglycemia. The protective effect ofCnr1-/-BMT is reminiscent of the similar effect of macrophage-specific in vivo knockdown ofCnr1(19). The role of macrophage CB1R in beta-cell loss is further supported by the protective effect of macrophage-specific knockdown ofIrf5and the regulation ofIrf5expression by CB1R. Thus, macrophage CB1Rs are both necessary and sufficient to account for the development of T2D in this model. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity (35) also contribute to beta-cell damage, either directly or by inducing the EC/CB1R system, as shown previously (19). In contrast, the transfer ofCnr1-/-BM to ZDF rats did not mitigate diabetic nephropathy, indicating the involvement of a different cellular pool of CB1Rs. This is in agreement with the absence of significant infiltration of proinflammatory macrophages into glomeruli during the development of nephropathy in ZDF rats (21). A similar lack of involvement of proinflammatory macrophages has been indicated by the findings that selective deletion of Nlrp3 or caspase-1 expression in BM-derived cells failed to protect mice against the development of diabetic nephropathy, and the protective effect of the global deletion ofNlrp3was not reversed by the transplantation of wild-type BM cells intoNlrp3-deficient mice (36). The congruent effects of pharmacological blockade and genetic deletion of CB1Rs strongly support the diabetogenic role of increased CB1R activity. This is different from the situation in leptin-deficientob/obmice, in which germline deletion ofCnr1aggravated rather than mitigated their glucose intolerance (37). However,ob/obmice on a C57BL/6J background compensate for IR by beta-cell proliferation and thus do not become overtly diabetic, so the key pathogenic process promoted by CB1R activity in ZDF rats was absent in the murine model. On the other hand, the deletion ofCnr1in both models failed to reverse basal hyperinsulinemia and IR, which is likely related to the leptin-deficient state. Leptin receptors are present on beta-cells where they mediate increased KATPchannel activity (38), and their activation was reported to decrease basal, but not glucose-stimulated, insulin secretion (39). Most importantly, we discovered that the transcription factor IRF5 is a key downstream mediator of CB1R-induced cytokine release by inflammatory macrophages and the resulting loss of beta-cell function. First,Irf5expression was robustly increased in the islets of ZDF compared with lean control rats. This increase was prevented by pharmacological blockade or genetic deletion of CB1R, which also prevented macrophage infiltration of islets, suggesting thatIrf5expression was induced in macrophages. This was then further confirmed by the CB1R agonist-induced increase inIrf5expression in primary cultured mouse and rat macrophages or in THP-1 cells. This effect was PTX sensitive but unaffected by p38MAPK or JNK blockade or knockdown, suggesting that it resulted from Gi/o-mediated inhibition of adenylate cyclase. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated knockdown ofIrf5in macrophages blunted the CB1R agonist-induced increase in TNF-alpha and IL-1beta secretion andNlrp3expression, indicating the obligatory role of IRF5 in proinflammatory cytokine release. The anti-inflammatory response toIrf5knockdown also involved a TH2-type immune response, as indicated by the increase in CD3+T lymphocytes and the increased expression of the TH2 markersGata3andIl4and decreased expression of the TH1 markerTbetin pancreatic islets. These changes are similar to those found in adipose tissue of mice with diet-induced obesity (23) and are consistent with the proposed role of a TH1-type inflammatory response in T2D and its renal complications (40,41). Finally, macrophage-specific in vivo knockdown ofIrf5in ZDF rats protected beta-cells and prevented the development of hyperglycemia, similar to the earlier reported effects of chronic CB1R blockade or selective knockdown ofCnr1in macrophages (19). IRF5, originally discovered as a transcription factor induced by type I interferons during viral infections (42), was more recently identified as a master regulator of macrophage M1 polarization and a mediator of obesity-related adipose tissue inflammation and the resulting IR (23). The present findings establish that the G-protein-coupled receptor CB1R is an upstream regulator ofIrf5expression and point to a broader metabolic function of macrophage IRF5 as a key driver of diabetogenic insulitis and beta-cell loss. Unlike CB1R blockade or gene deletion, which also reduced CCL2 chemokine secretion and the resulting transmigration of macrophages into islets (19), the knockdown ofIrf5failed to influence these parameters. This suggested that CB1Rs signal via an alternative, IRF5-independent pathway to promote CCL2 secretion. Indeed, CB1R agonists activated p38MAPK and JNK but not ERK1/2 in rodent and human macrophages, and inhibitors of p38MAPK or JNK blocked the parallel increase in CCL2 secretion without affecting the increased secretion of TNF-alpha or IL-1beta. The siRNA-mediated knockdown of p38MAPKalpha, but not p38MAPKbeta, in THP-1 macrophages similarly inhibited CB1R-induced CCL2, but not TNF-alpha secretion, and partially inhibited IL-1beta secretion. This supports earlier findings that CB1R promotes CCL2 secretion via p38MAPK (43), but documents for the first time show the selective role of the p38MAPKalpha isoform in this effect. Whereas the above findings indicate that inflammatory macrophages are an important source of CCL2, we could also detect this chemokine in beta-cells, which is in agreement with evidence for CCL2 secretion by islet beta-cells (31,32). It is possible that in the early stages of diabetic insulitis, beta-cell-derived CCL2 initiates the transmigration of macrophages, which then amplify the production of this chemotactic signal. Another possible link between beta-cells and macrophages is islet amyloid polypeptide, which is secreted by beta-cells and stimulates inflammatory cytokine production by macrophages (44,45). Together, the above findings demonstrate that activation of CB1Rs in proinflammatory M1 macrophages increases chemokine and cytokine secretion via distinct, partially overlapping signaling pathways, as illustrated inFig. 8. The CB1R-induced secretion of CCL2, but not TNF-alpha, is mediated via the activation of p38MAPKalpha. On the other hand, the CB1R-induced secretion of TNF-alpha, but not CCL2, is mediated via IRF5, and both pathways contribute to increased IL-1beta secretion, with IRF5 having a more dominant role. The obligatory role of IRF5 in the secretion of cytotoxic cytokines thought to drive beta-cell loss (19) is highlighted by the protective effect of macrophage-specific in vivo knockdown ofIrf5. These findings mark IRF5 as a potential therapeutic target in T2D. Schematic illustration of the proposed mechanism by which the activation of CB1Rs in macrophages leads to the loss of beta-cell function.
