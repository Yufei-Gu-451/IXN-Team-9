The involvement of the alpha-synuclein protein in Parkinson disease (PD) rests on three primary strands of evidence: (1) missense and copy number mutations in theSNCAgene encoding alpha-synuclein cause autosomal dominant PD[30]; (2) polymorphic alleles near theSNCAgene, some of which have functional impact on alpha-synuclein expression, increase susceptibility to PD[30]; and (3) aggregated alpha-synuclein protein is a major constituent of Lewy bodies, the pathognomonic protein aggregates found in the nervous systems of sporadic PD patients[3],[28]. alpha-Synuclein has a wide tissue expression in fetal life[18]and continues to be very highly expressed in adult neural tissues, red blood cells (RBCs) and platelets[22],[25],[26], while the remainder of adult tissues of the rodent or human are reported to have little or no expression[31]. A bewildering array of cellular functions have been proposed for alpha-synuclein including synaptic vesicle trafficking, neurotransmitter release, mitochondrial function, lipid metabolism, neurogenesis, neuroprotection, and melanin biosynthesis[5],[6],[7],[11],[13]. Adding to the difficulty of determining its normal function is that mice ablated for theSncagene appear to have little or no neurological phenotype[6],[7],[11],[13]. alpha-Synuclein has also been found to have enzymatic activity as an NADH-dependent ferrireductase capable of reducing Fe+3to Fe+2[5],[10]. As with the nervous system, no clear hematological phenotype has been reported inSnca-/- mice either. Thus, nearly 20 years of intensive study have yet to convincingly reveal alpha-synuclein's normal function in the nervous system or in hematopoietic tissues. Genetic and biochemical data have clearly demonstrated that the soluble isoform of cytochrome b5reductase-3 (E.C. 1.6.2.2), which utilizes electrons transferred from NADHviacytochrome b5, is the primary enzyme responsible for methemoglobin (methgb) reduction in the red blood cell[23]. Nonetheless, given alpha-synuclein's ferrireductase activity, combined with its high expression in red blood cells, we hypothesized that it might also function, perhaps in an ancillary role, in reducing Fe+3in methgb to Fe+2and regenerating normal hemoglobin. We therefore undertook a series of experiments exploring the role of alpha-synuclein in the recovery from chemically-induced methemoglobinemia. We used a series of genetically engineered mouse strains that differ in alpha-synuclein expression in various tissues, including the nervous system, RBCs and liver, to ask whether the presence or absence of alpha-synuclein in RBCs had an effect on recovery from methemoglobinemia. Initialin vivoexperiments with the potent methgb inducer, 4-hydroxy para-aminopropiophenone (4-OHPAPP) and its pro-drug, para-aminopropiophenone (PAPP)[14], demonstrated a significant prolongation of methemoglobinemia inSnca-/- mice compared toSnca+/+ mice. In vitroexperiments with RBCs, however, revealed that, contrary to the initial hypothesis, a lack of expression of alpha-synuclein in RBCs did not correlate with prolongation of methemoglobinemia. Instead, prolongation of chemically induced methemoglobinemia correlated with the absence of hepatic alpha-synuclein expression. We propose a new and robust whole-animal phenotype inSnca-/- mice, albeit one that is toxicological rather than neurological, that manifests as a defect in the detoxification of a xenobiotic in mice. The mice used in these experiments were all previously published[6],[16]and are summarized inTable 1. Experimental strains used were (1) mice transgenic for a P1-artificial chromosome (PAC) containing and expressing a wild-type humanSNCAgene (PAC-Tg(SNCANone)), (2) two independent lines of mice transgenic for a PAC containing and expressing an A53T mutantSNCAgene (PAC-Tg(SNCAA53T)), and two lines expressing an A30P mutant humanSNCAgene (PAC-Tg(SNCAA30P)). The PAC-Tg(SNCANone) line was bred onto theSnca-/- background and then intercrossed; mice homozygous for the transgene insertion andSncaknock-out allele (PAC-Tg(SNCAWT)+/+;Snca-/-) were selected for further study. The two PAC-Tg(SNCAA53T) lines were each bred onto theSnca-/- background to eliminate expression of the endogenous murine alpha-synuclein, intercrossed to be homozygous for the transgene insertion, and finally bred together to create a line of double transgenic animals that lacked murineSncaexpression and were homozygous for both sites of theSNCAA53TPAC insertion (dbl-PAC-Tg(SNCAA53T)+/+;Snca-/-). The PAC-Tg(SNCAA30P) mice were similarly crossed to create double transgenic animals with both PAC-SNCAA30Pinsertion sites in anSnca-/- background (dbl-PAC-Tg(SNCAA30P)+/+;Snca-/-). However, because one of the two PAC-SNCAA30Plines carried its insertion on the X chromosome, only female dbl-PAC-Tg(SNCAA30P) were homozygous for both PAC insertions (four copies of the PAC insertions) whereas the males had three copies of the PAC insertions. Because all PAC transgenics were initially made in the FVB/N strain while theSncaknock-out was made in 129S6/SvEvTac, the PAC transgenic animals on aSnca-/- background were in a mixed FVB/N * 129S6/SvEvTac background. We therefore crossed wild-type FVB/N mice with wild-type orSncaknock-out (Snca-/-) 129S6//SvEvTac mice to create matched control cohorts ofSnca+/+orSnca-/-animals with a mixed background similar to the PAC transgenic animals. NoneNoneNoneMouse strains used. Para-aminopropiophenone (PAPP) was purchased from City Chemical LLC (West Haven, CT 06516) and 4-hydroxyl p-aminopropiophenone at greater than 95% purity was provided by the Vanderbilt Institute of Chemical Biology, Chemical Synthesis Core (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN 37232-0412). 10Snca+/+ and 11Snca-/- mice received a single intraperitoneal injection of 33 nmoles/kg of PAPP dissolved at a concentration of 50 mg/ml in DMSO; 5Snca+/+ and 6Snca-/- mice received 40 nmoles/kg of 4-OHPAPP dissolved at a concentration of 50 mg/ml in DMSO. This dose is well below the LD50 of 2.3 mmole/kg for mice[27]. Control mice were injected with the same volume of DMSO without PAPP or 4-OHPAPP. Blood samples were obtained by submandibular bleeding of mice using a 5 mm lancet (Goldenrod, Medipoint, Inc) into blood collection tubes prepared with K2EDTA.2H2O as an anticoagulant (Safe-T-Fill, Ram Scientific). Blood samples were taken at 1, 2 and 4 h after treatment for methgb measurements. Blood was collected by submandibular bleeding into K2EDTA.2H2O collection tubes and blood from mice of the same genotype was pooled. RBCs were washed three times at room temperature in phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4, and 328-330 Osm. PAPP or PHAPP was dissolved in DMSO at 5 mg/ml and then diluted and added to washed erythrocytes fromSnca+/+ andSnca-/- mice at 30% hematocrit at a final concentration of 3 mug/ml of drug and incubated at 37 degrees C. Blood was treated with DMSO vehicle alone as a control. The percent methgb in a blood sample was determined by a modification of a previously published method[24]. In brief, 80 mul of blood was added to 1.2 ml of distilled water and mixed by inversion to hemolyze the red blood cells and to ensure complete oxygenation of hemoglobin. The mixture was left at room temperature for 2-3 min, then 0.24 ml of 0.5 M phosphate buffer pH 6.5 (0.22 M Na2HP04, 0.28 M KH2PO4) was added and the buffered hemolysate was immediately cooled on wet ice, followed by centrifugation at 1600 * gfor 5 min at 4 degrees C. The cleared, buffered hemolysate is designated solution S (sample). A second dilution, solution R (for reference), was made by adding 0.2 ml of solution S to 1.0 ml of 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 6.5. 1 mg of K3Fe(CN)6was added by adding 5 mul of a 20% w/v (200 mg/ml) solution in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, and mixed by inversion and left to stand at least 5 min at room temperature. 1 ml of solution S was added to a cuvette (10-mm light path) and the absorbance at 630 nm was measured = S1. Immediately following measurement of S1, 0.5 mg of KCN was added by adding 5 mul of a 10% w/v solution (100 mg/ml) to the cuvette, and mixed by inversion. After 2-3 min to allow for air bubbles to rise from the solution, the absorbance at 630 nm was read = S2. Solution R was transferred to a cuvette as above and the absorbance read at 630 nm = R1. Absorbance was then re-read at A630 after adding 5 mul of a 10% (100 mg/ml) w/v solution of KCN, mixing, and allowing it to stand for 2-3 min = R2. Percent methgb was calculated as 100(S1 - S2)/6(R1 - R2). The blood was incubated at 37 degrees C and triplicate samples taken at various time points for methgb measurements. Statistical significance of elevations of methgb between various mouse strainsin vivowas assessed by one-tailed Mann-Whitney test (Prism, GraphPad Software). Extrapolated Y-intercept and slopes forin vitrostudies were calculated by linear regression (Prism, GraphPad Software). Blood samples were prepared by mixing blood with phosphate buffered saline buffer containing 0.5% NP-40 containing protease and phosphatase inhibitor tablets (Roche) in 1:2 ratio, then centrifuged for 20 min at 4 degrees C at 5000 rpm. An equal volume of the blood/PBS supernatant and SDS buffer (30 mM Tris, pH 6.8, 2.5% SDS, 5% glycerol) were mixed and vortexed. Then an equal total volume of 2X Laemmli buffer containing 10% beta-mercaptoethanol was added and the sample immediately loaded onto the gel. Tissue samples were prepared as described previously from mice that been perfused with phosphate-buffered saline during euthanasia to flush blood out of the various tissues[16]. Proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE (12% Mini-PROTEAN TGXTM Gels -BIO RAD) and analyzed by western blot. Mouse anti-Snca (BD Transduction Laboratories) and horseradish peroxidase goat anti-mouse IgG (GE Healthcare) and either Clarity (BioRad) or Prime ECL kits (for high sensitivity) were used. To further increase sensitivity, cross-linking of alpha-synuclein was carried out by exposing blots to 0.4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature prior to blocking[17]. To test whether alpha-synuclein functionsin vivoas a ferrireductase in RBCs, we asked whetherSnca-/- mice would have elevated or more prolonged methemoglobinemia following exposure to a single intraperitoneal injection of PAPP (33 nmoles/kg in DMSO) or DMSO vehicle only. Blood was obtained 1, 2 and 4 h after injection for methgb measurement, expressed as a fraction of total hemoglobin (Fig. 1A). Wildtype (Snca+/+) mice had 2.4% methgb at 1 h following PAPP treatment, which then returned to baseline at 2 h. This time course is similar to what was previously observed in wildtype rats and mice treated with subcutaneous or intraperitoneal PAPP respectively[2],[27]. In contrast, mice lacking alpha-synuclein had 17% methgb 1 h after PAPP injection, a significantly greater level than in the wildtype mice (p = 0.00005, one-tailed Mann-Whitney test), with return nearly to baseline at 2 h and complete recovery by 4 h. Mice treated with DMSO vehicle only showed no methemoglobinemia. These experimental results were replicated 8 times with similar results (data not shown). The return of methgb levels to normal was not due to splenic sequestration or destruction of RBCs carrying elevated methgb since the hematocrits of both sets of animals were equal and normal, unchanged from baseline (data not shown). Thus, the methgb induction did not cause irreversible destruction of RBCs. NoneNoneNone(A) Time course of methemoglobinemia following induction by a single i.p. injection of PAPP (33 nmoles/kg BW) in 10Snca+/+ and 11Snca-/- mice. Methemoglobinemia was prolonged at 1 h inSnca-/-versus Snca+/+ mice (***p = 0.00005, one-sided Mann-Whitney test). Five mice of each genotype were available at 2 and 4 h. No significant difference betweenSnca+/+ and 11Snca-/- mice at 2 and 4 h. (B) Time course of methemoglobinemia following induction by a single i.p. injection of 4-OHPAPP(44 nmoles/kg BW) in 5Snca+/+ and 6Snca-/- mice. Methemoglobinemia was prolonged at 1 h and 2 h in 6Snca-/-versus5Snca+/+ mice (**p = 0.0022, one-sided Mann-Whitney test). (C) Time course of methemoglobinemia following induction by a single i.p. injection of a larger dose of 4-OHPAPP(60 nmoles/kg BW) in 4Snca+/+ and 4Snca-/- mice. Methemoglobinemia was prolonged at 1, 1.5 and 2 h inSnca-/-versus Snca+/+ mice (*p = 0.05, one-sided Mann-Whitney test). Since PAPP is a pro-drug that must be convertedin vivoto its active methgb-producing metabolite, 4-OHPAPP[14], we repeated thein vivoinduction of methgb with a single intraperitoneal injection of 4-OHPAPP (40 nmoles/kg in DMSO). As before, DMSO served as a vehicle-only control. 4-OHPAPP induced methgb in bothSnca+/+ andSnca-/- strains of mice (Fig. 1B). TheSnca-/- mice, however, had significantly greater levels of methemoglobinemia at 1 h (32% compared to 14% inSnca+/+ mice,p = 0.0022, one-tailed Mann-Whitney test). Methemoglobinemia remained significantly elevated at 14% inSnca-/- 2 h after injection, as compared to the methgb levels in theSnca+/+ mice, which had returned to baseline by that time (p = 0.0022, one-tailed Mann-Whitney test). Methgb levels returned to baseline in both genotypes by 4 h after injection. Although there was some variability when an approximately 50% higher dose of 4-OHPAPP (60 nmoles/kg) was used, the more prolonged methemoglobinemia inSnca-/- miceversuswildtype mice was replicated (p = 0.05, one-tailed Mann-Whitney test) (Fig. 1C). We then repeated the methgb induction experimentsin vitro. We incubated RBCs fromSnca+/+ andSnca-/- mice with 3 mug/ml PAPP, 3 mug/ml 4-OHPAPP, or DMSO vehicle alone. As expected,in vitrotreatment of RBCs with the pro-drug PAPP did not induce methgb (data not shown). RBCs treatedin vitrowith 4-OHPAPP showed rapid and robust methgb production. What was surprising, however, was that the percent methgb at a given concentration of 4-OHPAPP was similar in both mouse strains and then slowly declined over a period of more than 6 h with a similar time courses (Fig. 2). Linear regression analysis comparing the slopes and extrapolated Y-intercepts were not statistically significantly different. There was also no significant hemolysis observed during the 6 h ours of incubation. There was, therefore, little evidence that alpha-synuclein in RBCs had an appreciable effect on the induction of, or recovery from, methgb induced by 4-OHPAPP in intact RBCs. NoneNoneNoneTime course of percent methemoglobin in washed RBCs fromSnca+/+ andSnca-/- mice exposed to 3 mug/ml 4-OHPAPP. Each point represents the average of three measurements at a given time point for each genotype and treatment (4-OHPAPPversusvehicle only). These results indicate that while expression of alpha-synuclein affects the response of mice to 4-OHPAPP and PAPP treatments, the different response is not due to alpha-synuclein's expression in RBCs. To investigate an alternative possibility, that alpha-synuclein is involved in detoxification of 4-OHPAPP, we used three transgenic mice in which theSNCAgene is expressed differently in various non-neuronal tissues. We have previously generated and published a series of transgenic mice made with human P1-artificial chromosomes (PACs) containing the wildtype, A53T mutant and A30P mutant versions of the humanSNCAgene, and crossed them all onto a mouse background ablated for endogenous murineSnca(Table 1)[16]. In these mice, therefore, the only alpha-synuclein being made is human, encoded by the transgenic PACs. The transgenic mice show robust expression in the central and enteric nervous systems[16]. They do not, however, match wildtype mice in their expression of alpha-synuclein in non-neural tissues such as blood, liver, kidney, lung and spleen (Fig. 3A and B). In particular, while some of the PAC transgenic mice do express alpha-synuclein in RBCs and liver, others do not. These mice, therefore, offered an opportunity to dissect the role played by alpha-synuclein expression in different tissues in the persistent methgb we observed inSnca-/- mice following PAPP or 4-OHPAPP treatment. The fact that some of these mice expressed A53T or A30P mutant rather than wildtype alpha-synuclein is not an impediment since Davies et al. [10]found no difference in ferrireductase activity between wildtype alpha-synuclein and proteins with either the A53T or A30 P mutations. NoneNoneNone(A) Western blot of alpha-synuclein in red blood cells, liver, kidney, lung and spleen.

(C) Time course of methemoglobinemia following induction by a single i.p. injection of 4-OHPAPP(44 nmoles/kg BW) in mouse strains with defined genotypes as described inTable 1. Each measurement is the average of 5 mice. At 1 h, methemoglobinemia was elevated more than two-fold inSnca-/-versus Snca+/+ (**p = 0.0011, one-tailed Mann-Whitney test) and showed a barely significant decrease in A53Tversus Snca+/+ (*p = 0.024, one-tailed Mann-Whitney test). At 2 h, methemoglobinemia was prolonged 5-7 fold inSnca-/- and wtPAC linesversus Snca+/+ mice (**p = 0.0022, *p = 0.016, respectively, one-tailed Mann-Whitney test). All lines recovered equally by 4 h.Followingin vivoexposure of the different PAC transgenic mice to 4-OHPAPP, we observed persistence of methgb, similar to what was seen withSnca-/- mice, in the wtPAC line, while others, including the dtgA53T and dtgA30P, demonstrated a rapid reversal of the methgb levels, similar to what has been seen inSnca+/+ mice (Fig. 3C). By comparing the pattern of expression (Fig. 3A and B) with the recovery of the different lines from 4-OHPAPP induced methemoglobinemia (Fig. 3C), it is clear that only alpha-synuclein expression in liver, which is absent in theSnca-/- and wtPAC lines, correlated with prolonged methemoglobinemia. Furthermore, the lack of alpha-synuclein expression in red cells in the dtgA30P line, which showed rapid reversal of methemoglobinemia, and the robust alpha-synuclein expression in kidney, lung and spleen in the wtPAC line, which showed prolonged methemoglobinemia, indicate there is no correlation between expression in those tissues and prolonged methemoglobinemia. We conclude, therefore, that the persistence of methgb inSnca-/- mice did not correlate with expression of alpha-synuclein in RBCs, kidney, lung or spleen but, instead, correlated with liver expression. The high levels of alpha-synuclein in red blood cells, combined with its ferrireductase activity, led us to perform a series of experiments exploring the role of alpha-synuclein in reversing chemically-induced methemoglobinemia, despite there being extensive evidence that soluble cytochrome b5reductase-3 is the primary enzyme responsible for methgb reduction in the red blood cell[23]. For these experiments, we used the compound PAPP and its active metabolite 4-OHPAPP (Fig. 4A). As with other derivatives of aniline, PAPP is converted into its hydroxylamine derivative 4-OHPAPP, which then directly generates methgb[1],[15]. Whether the activation of PAPP to 4-OHPAPP occurs in the liver[9]and/or in the lung[29]is not known. Serum levels of 4-OHPAPP following PAPP administration are quite low but the compound is still able to generate far more methgb than would be predicted by simple stoichiometry because, once inside the RBC, it binds tightly to hemoglobin, oxidizes hemoglobin to generate methgb and is converted to p-nitrosopropiophenone (PNPP). PNPP is then converted back to 4-OHPAPP by NADPH generated by the pentose monophosphate pathway, a cycle known as the Kreisprozess (Fig. 4B)[1]. Little is known about the metabolic fate of 4-OHPAPP outside the Kreisprozess[1],[19]. NoneNoneNone(A) Structure of compounds referred to in text.

(B) Metabolism of PAPP and pathways involved in generating methgb (adapted from Baskin and Fricke[1], Jagow et al. [32], Bright and Marrs[4], Marrs and Bright[20], and Marrs et al. [21]). A direct role for alpha-synuclein in recovery from methgb induction was initially supported byin vivoexperiments in which either the prodrug PAPP or its active metabolite 4-OHPAPP delivered i.p. showed markedly prolonged methgb levels inSnca-/- mice as compared toSnca+/+ mice. This hypothesis, however, had to be discarded whenin vitroexperiments with blood samples fromSnca-/- andSnca+/+ mice showed no difference in the persistence of methgb induced by 4-OHPAPP. We decided to take advantage of a series of transgenic mice that either expressed or did not express wildtype or mutant alpha-synuclein in RBCs and other non-neuronal tissues such as liver, kidney, lung and spleen to examine the relationship between tissue expression of alpha-synuclein and recovery from 4-OHPAPP treatmentin vivo. Detecting even the low levels of expression of alpha-synuclein in some of these tissues is made possible by crosslinking alpha-synuclein on the western blot membrane to increase antibody reactivity and using highly sensitive Western blotting reagents. Using this technique, wildtypeSnca+/+ mice showed expression in the liver, as did some of the transgenic animals, although below the level present in the wildtype mice. We found prolongation of methemoglobinemia following 4-OHPAPP treatment correlated with a lack of expression of alpha-synuclein in liver, and not in RBC, kidney, lung or spleen. Although this was a surprising result in view of older published literature asserting alpha-synuclein was poorly expressed, if at all, in adult liver[18],[31], our observation of liver expression is supported by the PaxDb database of protein abundance, which indicates there is expression of the protein in liver, albeit at baseline levels that are ?1/30th to 1/40th that of brain[33]. Baseline expression levels, however, may be an underestimate as it has been shown that alpha-synuclein expression can be strongly transcriptionally upregulated by liver X receptor ligands[8]. In summary, we have shown that prolongation of methemoglobinemia following PAPP or 4-OHPAPP treatment is a novel phenotype forSnca-/- mice. The phenotype does not reflect a direct effect of alpha-synuclein on reduction of methemoglobin since there was no differencein vitrobetween RBCs with and without alpha-synuclein in their response to chemically induced methemoglobinemia. Instead, the persistence of methemoglobinemia following PAPP or 4-OHPAPP treatmentin vivocorrelated with the absence of even the normally low levels of alpha-synuclein in the liver. The increased sensitivity ofSnca-/- mice to PAPP-induced methemoglobinemia cannot simply be the result of increased conversion of the prodrug PAPP to 4-OHPAPP since 4-OHPAPP itself results in an even more striking difference in the level and duration of methemoglobinemia inSnca-/- mice than does PAPP. We believe the methemoglobinemia induced by 4-OHPAPP simply serves as a biomarker for alpha-synuclein's role in the metabolism of 4-OHPAPP and, by extension, potentially other xenobiotic toxicants as well. Such a role adds a new dimension to the longstanding debate over the pathogenesis of PD,i.e. whether the disease is caused by environmental exposure to toxicants[12]or by a genetic susceptibility conferred by, among other genetic factors, increased expression or mutation of alpha-synuclein[30]. Instead, we propose that a direct interaction between alpha-synuclein and the environmental toxicants it participates in detoxifying could cause damage to this and other proteins, leading to aggregation and the initiation of a process that ultimately leads to PD.
