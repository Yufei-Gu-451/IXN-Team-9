Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and second leading cause of cancer deaths among men in developed countries (CooperbergNone, 2009). In early-stage PCa, greater than 90% of patients initially respond to therapeutic use of androgen deprivation; however, many cases become refractory and progress to androgen-independent PCa (NelsonNone, 2008). Hormone-refractory PCa is currently difficult to treat and most clinical trials for advanced PCa have shown limited benefits, with disease progression and metastasis to bone or other sites (BottNone, 2003;TimsitNone, 2008). Thus, new prognostic markers and effective treatment strategies are urgently needed. MicroRNAs, small non-coding RNAs 20-22 nucleotides in length, are involved in crucial biological processes, including development, differentiation, apoptosis, and proliferation (Bartel, 2004). They pair imperfectly with target mRNAs of protein-coding genes and thereby regulate transcriptional or post-transcriptional expression (Bartel, 2009). Bioinformatic predictions indicate that miRNAs regulate greater than 30% of the protein-coding genes (FilipowiczNone, 2008). It is estimated that ?1000 miRNAs exist in the vertebrate genome. At present, 1424 human miRNAs have been registered at miRBase release 17.0 (http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk/). A growing body of evidence indicates that miRNAs contribute to the initiation and development of many types of human cancer (ZhangNone, 2007). Overexpressed miRNAs could act as oncogenes by repressing tumour suppressor genes. Analogously, miRNAs which normally suppress oncogenes could permit their function when underexpressed (Davis and Hata, 2010). Many genome-wide profiling studies have been carried out to identify differentially expressed miRNAs (LuNone, 2005;Calin and Croce, 2006). In comparative miRNA expression studies, several miRNAs (e.g., themiR-34family, themiR-200family,miR-101,miR-15a/16,miR-205,miR-146,andmiR-145) were often found to be downregulated. Those observations suggested that these miRNAs could be important in PCa initiation and development (CattoNone, 2011). Functional analyses of these miRNAs have been conducted at many research facilities. Furthermore, miRNA profile in PCa provides evidence that miRNAs can be used as diagnostic and prognostic markers (SchaeferNone, 2010). More recently, we and other researchers demonstrated that restoration ofmiR-145inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in PCa cells (ZamanNone, 2010;FuseNone, 2011). We performed genome-wide gene expression analysis to identify candidate genes targeted bymiR-145, and several oncogenic genes were identified, such as FSCN1 and SWAP70 (ChiyomaruNone, 2011;FuseNone, 2011). The identification of tumour suppressive miRNAs and their target genes could provide new insights into potential mechanisms of PCa oncogenesis. Recently, our miRNA expression signature analyses showed thatmiR-1andmiR-133awere significantly reduced in several types of cancer (KanoNone, 2010;YoshinoNone, 2011;NohataNone, 2011a). Furthermore, overexpression of both miRNAs inhibited cancer cell proliferation and induced cancer cell apoptosis (NasserNone, 2008;ChiyomaruNone, 2010b;KawakamiNone, 2011;YoshinoNone, 2011;NohataNone, 2011b). Interestingly,miR-1-1/miR-133a-2andmiR-1-2/miR-133a-1are clustered on different chromosomal regions in the human genome, 20q13.33 and 18q11.2, respectively. It is well known that several miRNAs form a cluster in the human genome such asmiR-17-92,miR-106a-368,miR-221-222,miR-106b-25and themiR-200family. In PCa oncogenesis, themiR-15a/16-1cluster acts as a tumour suppressor by targeting multiple oncogenes, includingBCL2,CCND1, andWINT3A(BonciNone, 2008). We hypothesised thatmiR-1andmiR-133amight be previously unidentified tumour suppressive miRNAs in PCa. The next challenge was to identifymiR-1- andmiR-133a-regulated cancer pathways. For target genes searches ofmiR-1andmiR-133ain PCa cells, we performed genome-wide gene expression analyses. We focused on thepurine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP)gene as a candidate target ofmiR-1andmiR-133ain PCa cells. Insights into the association between tumour suppressive miRNAs and their target oncogene networks could enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanism of PCa oncogenesis. The clinical specimens were obtained from patients in Teikyo University Chiba Medical Center Hospital from 2008 to 2010. All the patients had elevated levels of prostate-specific antigen and had undergone transrectal prostate needle biopsy. Prostatic cancerous tissues (PCa,n=15) and non-cancerous tissues (non-PCa,n=17) were used in this study. The patients' characteristics are shown inTable 1andSupplementary Table 1. Written consent of tissue donation for research purposes was obtained from patients before tissue collection. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Teikyo University. To justified tissue composition, a pair of needle biopsy specimen was collected from same region in the patients in this study, and one was subjected to pathological justification; no cancerous tissue was found in specimens of Non-PCa. We used two human PCa cell lines, PC3 and DU145, which were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA) and were maintained in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2and 95% air at 37 degrees C.Total RNA including miRNA was extracted using the mirVana miRNA isolation kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) using the manufacturer's protocol. The integrity of the RNA was checked with the RNA 6000 Nano Assay Kit and a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Normal prostate RNAs were purchased as follows: prostate 1 (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA; Human Prostate Total RNA, no. 636550), prostate 2 (FirstChoice Human Prostate Total RNA, #AM7988, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), and prostate 3 (Biochain Total RNA-Human adult Normal Tissue, Hayward, CA, USA; no. R1234201-P). First-strand cDNA was prepared from total RNA (1 mug) using a High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems). In the real-time PCR step, complementary DNA was amplified and the gene-specific PCR products were assayed using the 7900-HT Real-Time PCR System according to the manufacturer's protocol. Thermal cycling conditions were as follows: 95 degrees C for 10 min, 40 cycles of 95 degrees C for 15 s and 63 degrees C for 1 min. TaqMan probes and primers forPNP(assay ID: Hs00165367_m1) and humanGAPDH(assay ID: Hs0329097_g1) were obtained from Applied Biosystems (Assay-On-Demand Gene Expression Products). For miRNA RT-PCR, the cDNA strand was synthesised using TaqMan quantitative real-time PCR (TaqMan MicroRNA Assay; Applied Biosystems). The expression levels ofmiR-1(assay ID: 002222) andmiR-133a(assay ID: 002246) were normalised toRNU6B(Assay ID 001973). All reactions were performed in triplicate, and negative controls lacking cDNA were included. The data were analysed with the delta-delta Ct method to calculate the fold change. About the internal controls, we examined the unevenness between the clinical samples and adopted to useGAPDHandRNU6Bin this study. Pre-miR and negative-control miRNA (Applied Biosystems) were used in the gain-of-function experiments, whereasPNPsiRNA (Cat # HSS107263 and HSS181558; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and negative-control siRNA (D-001810-10; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) were used in the loss-of-function experiments. As previously described (IchimiNone, 2009), PC3 and DU145 cells were transiently transfected with either precursors ofmiR-1andmiR-133aor negative control using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX transfection reagent (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Mock transfections, which only had the transfection reagent, were also used as controls. The transfection efficiency of miRNA into cancer cells was evaluated by downregulation of mRNA levels ofPTK9as described previously (IchimiNone, 2009). Cells were seeded in 6-well plates for the mRNA and protein extraction and the wound-healing assays (25 * 104per well), in 24-well plates for luciferase reporter assays (10 * 104per well), and in 96-well plates for XTT assays (3000 per well). Cell proliferation was determined by using an XTT assay (Roche Applied Sciences, Tokyo, Japan) performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell migration activity was evaluated with a wound-healing assay. Cells were plated in 6-well dishes, and the cell monolayers were scraped using a P-20 micropipette tip. The initial gap length (0 h) and the residual gap length 24 h after wounding were calculated from photomicrographs. A cell invasion assay was carried out using modified Boyden Chambers consisting of transwell-precoated Matrigel membrane filter inserts with 8 mum micron pores in 24-well tissue culture plates (BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA, USA). Minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum in the lower chamber served as the chemoattractant, as described previously (ChiyomaruNone, 2010b). All experiments were performed in triplicate. After 3 days of transfection, protein lysates (30 mug) were separated on NuPAGE on 4-12% bis-tris gels (Invitrogen) and transferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. Immunoblotting was done with diluted (1 : 500) polyclonal PNP antibody (HPA001625; Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) and GAPDH antibody (MAB374; Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA). The membrane was washed and then incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L)-HRP conjugate (BIO-RAD, Hercules, CA, USA). Specific complexes were visualised with an echochemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK). Oligo-microarray human 44K (Agilent) was used for expression profiling ofmiR-1-andmiR-133a-transfected PCa cell lines (PC3 and DU145) in comparison withmiR-negative controltransfectants as previously described (SugimotoNone, 2009). In brief, hybridisation and washing steps were performed in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The arrays were scanned using a Packard GSI Lumonics ScanArray 4000 (Perkin-Elmer, Boston, MA, USA). The data obtained were analysed with DNASIS array software (Hitachi Software Engineering, Tokyo, Japan), which converted the signal intensity for each spot into the text format. The log2 ratios of the median subtracted background intensity were analysed. Data from each microarray study were subjected to global normalisation. The predicted target genes and their miRNA binding site seed regions were investigated using TargetScan (release 5.1,http://www.targetscan.org/). The sequences of the predicted mature miRNAs were confirmed by referring to miRBase (release 17.0;http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk/). miR-1andmiR-133atarget sequences were inserted between theXhoI-PmeI restriction sites in the 3'UTR of thehRlucgene in the psiCHECK-2 vector (C8021; Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Full-length 3'UTR sequences ofPNPmRNA and specific miRNA target sequences (Supplementary Table 1) formiR-1andmiR-133awere artificially synthesised and inserted into the vector. In addition, we constructed three mutant vectors in which the specific sites targeted by the miRNAs were deleted. Following that, PC3 cells were transfected with 5 ng of vector, 10 nM of miRNA, and 1 mul of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in 100 mul of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen). The activities of firefly andRenillaluciferases in cell lysates were determined with a dual-luciferase assay system (E1910; Promega). Normalised data were calculated as the quotient ofRenilla/firefly luciferase activities. A tissue microarray containing 60 PCa specimens, 10 prostatic intraepithelial neoplasias (PINs), and 10 prostatic hyperplastic samples was obtained from Provitro (Berlin, Germany) (Cat #401 2209, Lot #146P260710.1-11, Berlin, BRD). Detailed information on all tumour specimens can be found athttp://www.provitro.co.uk/Neoplastic-tumour-TMA.82.0.htmL. Immunostaining was done on the tissue microarray following the manufacturer's protocol. The primary rabbit polyclonal antibodies against PNP (Sigma-Aldrich) were diluted 1 : 450. The slides were treated with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). Diaminobenzidine-hydrogen peroxide (Sigma-Aldrich) was the chromogen and the counterstaining was done with 0.5% haematoxylin. Immunostaining was evaluated according to the scoring method as described previously (ZhangNone, 2010). Each case was scored on the basis of the intensity and area of staining. The intensity of staining was graded on the following scale: 0, no staining; 1+, mild staining; 2+, moderate staining; and 3+, intense staining. The area of staining was evaluated as follows: 0, no staining of cells in any microscopic field; 1+, 30% of cells stained positive; 2+, 30-60% stained positive; and 3+, 60% stained positive. The immunostaining scores (intensity+extent) were combined and analysed. The relationship between two variables and the numerical values obtained by real-time RT-PCR were analysed using the Mann-WhitneyU-test. The relationship among three variables and the numerical values were analysed using the Bonferroni-adjusted Mann-WhitneyU-test. Expert StatView analysis software (version 4; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) was used in both cases. In the comparison among three variables, a non-adjusted statistical level of significance ofP less than 0.05 corresponds to a Bonferroni-adjusted level ofP less than 0.0167. We evaluated expression levels ofmiR-1andmiR-133ain PCa (n=15) and non-PCa (n=17) tissues. Patient characteristics are shown inTable 1andSupplementary Table 1. RNA was extracted and miRNA expression levels ofmiR-1andmiR-133awere determined by RT-PCR. The expression levels ofmiR-1andmiR-133awere significantly lower in PCa compared with non-PCa tissues (P=0.0001 andP=0.0002, respectively;Figure 1A). The expression levels ofmiR-1andmiR-133awere analysed for their correlation. A correlation coefficient of 0.571 withP less than 0.001 indicated thatmiR-1expression was highly correlated with that ofmiR-133a(Figure 1B). We evaluated the transfection efficiency of the miRNAs in cancer cell lines based on the downregulation of mRNA expression levels ofprotein tyrosine kinase 9(PTK9, alias as twinfilin:TWF1) aftermiR-1transfection. As a result of our microarray analysis ofmiR-1transfectants, it was admitted thatPTK9expression was downregulated (Supplementary Table 2A). This thing shows that transfection of miRNAs was effectiveness in cancer cells. The expression levels ofmiR-1andmiR-133ain PC3 and DU145 were determined by RT-PCR and compared with clinical specimens. The expression levels ofmiR-1andmiR-133awere significantly lower in PC3 and DU145 than those seen in tissues (Figure 1A). To examine the functional roles ofmiR-1andmiR-133a, we performed gain-of-function studies using miRNA transfections into PC3 and DU145 cells. The XTT assay revealed cell proliferation inhibition in the two miRNA-transfected PCa cell lines in comparison with mock and the control transfectants (Figure 2A). The wound-healing assay demonstrated significant cell migration inhibitions in these miRNA-transfected PC3 cell lines compared with their counterparts (Figure 2B). However, no significant inhibition was observed inmiR-133a-transfected DU145 cell lines (Figure 2B). Supplementary Figure 2Ashows the actual images of the wound-healing assay. The Matrigel invasion assay demonstrated that the number of invading cells was significantly decreased in these miRNA transfectants compared with their counterparts (Figure 2C). Supplementary Figure 2Bshows the actual images of the invasion assay. It is plausible themiR-1/miR-133acluster may have important role as tumour suppressors through downregulating these oncogenic genes. However, we found no simultaneous effect of cell viability inhibition bymiR-1andmiR-133aco-transfection (Supplementary Figure 1). To identify the target genes ofmiR-1andmiR-133a, we performed genome-wide gene expression analysis withmiR-1,miR-133a,and negative-control miRNA transfections into PC3 and DU145 cells. Downregulated genes in eithermiR-1ormiR-133atransfectants with less than a -1.0 (log2 ratio) downregulation compared with the control transfectants are shown inSupplementary Table 2A and B. According to the microarray data, a total of 14 genes were downregulated by bothmiR-1andmiR-133atransfections (Table 2). The Target Scan Program showed that six genes had putative target sites of bothmiR-1andmiR-133ain their 3'UTR (TAGLN2:transgelin 2,WDR78:WD repeat domain 78,C4orf34:chromosome 4 open reading frame 34,PNP:purine nucleoside phosphorylase,LASS2:LAG1 homologue, ceramide synthase 2 andSTXBP4:syntaxin binding protein 4;Table 2). To confirm the expression levels of these genes in the clinical specimens (PCa and non-PCa tissues), RT-PCR was performed. The data showed thatPNPwas highly expressed in the PCa specimens compared with non-PCa tissues (Supplementary Figure 4). These results indicated thatPNPwas a possible target gene ofmiR-1andmiR-133aand function as an oncogene. The current microarray data were approved by the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and were assigned GEO accession number GSE26032. The mRNA and protein expression levels of PNP were markedly downregulated inmiR-1-andmiR-133a-transfected PC3 and DU145 cells in comparison with the mock and control transfectants (Figure 3A and B). We performed a luciferase reporter assay to determine whetherPNPmRNA had a functional target site formiR-1andmiR-133a. We used a vector encoding the 3'UTR ofPNPmRNA including target sites formiR-1andmiR-133a(positions 365-371 and 407-413, respectively;Supplementary Table 3) and found that the luminescence intensity was significantly reduced by transfectants of vector contained wild-type sequence in vector (Figure 4). The luminescence intensity significantly decreased in the presence of either sites targeted bymiR-1ormiR-133a, while the luminescence intensity was not decreased when the seed sequence of both target sites was deleted from the vectors (Figure 4;Supplementary Table 3). These data suggest thatmiR-1andmiR-133adirectly bind to specific sites on 3'UTR ofPNPmRNA. The expression levels ofPNPmRNA were upregulated in PC3 and DU145 cells compared with non-PCa tissues (Supplementary Figure 5). There was no inverse correlation between the mRNA expression ofmiR-1/miR-133aandPNPin clinical specimens in this study. To examine the functional role of PNP, we performed loss-of-function studies using two differentsi-PNPtransfections into PC3 and DU145 cells. Expression of bothPNPmRNA and PNP protein was markedly repressed insi-PNPtransfectants (Figure 5A and B). The XTT assay revealed cell proliferation inhibition in the twosi-PNP-transfected PC3 cell lines in comparison with those of the mock and thesi-controltransfectants (P less than 0.0001;Figure 6A). However, no significant inhibition was observed in DU145 cell lines (Figure 6A). The wound-healing assay demonstrated significant cell migration inhibitions in the twosi-PNPtransfectants compared with their counterparts (Figure 6B). Supplementary Figure 3Ashows the actual images of the wound-healing assay. The Matrigel invasion assay demonstrated that the number of invading cells was significantly decreased in the twosi-PNPtransfectants compared with their counterparts (Figure 6C). Supplementary Figure 3Bshows the actual images of the invasion assay. Purine nucleoside phosphorylase was detected by immunohistochemical staining. We compared the expression levels in PCa, intraepithelial neoplasm (PIN) and normal prostatic tissue. The PNP was strongly expressed in several tumour lesions (Gleason Score 3+4, pT3aN0;Figure 7A) and PIN lesions (Figure 7B), whereas no or low expression was observed in the normal tissues (Figure 7C). The expression score of PCa was significantly higher than that of normal tissues (P=0.0037;Figure 7). There was no significant difference of expression of PNP analysed with clinicopathological parameters. Innumerable articles have reported that miRNAs are aberrantly expressed in many types of human cancers. miRNA expression profiles of PCa also have been reported by many researchers (PorkkaNone, 2007;OzenNone, 2008;GandelliniNone, 2009;SchaeferNone, 2010). While some controversy remains, it is certain that genome-wide expression analysis contributes to our understanding of miRNA's role as oncogenes and/or tumour suppressors (NicolasNone, 2011). For example,miR-15a/16-1that are clustered together on chromosome 13q14 are established as tumour suppressive miRNAs in human cancers including PCa (AqeilanNone, 2010). Downregulation ofmiR-15aandmiR-16-1was frequently found in PCa specimens (PorkkaNone, 2011). The restoration of both miRNAs in LNCaP cells showed a dramatic apoptotic effectin vitroandin vivoas they targeted multiple oncogenes such asBCL2,CCND1,andWNT3A(BonciNone, 2008). Interestingly,BCL2is overexpressed in the majority of patients with hormone-refractory PCa, and mediates resistance to androgen ablation and chemotherapy (YoshinoNone, 2006). These data strongly suggest that downregulation ofmiR-15a/16-1cluster and overexpression of BCL2 might contribute to PCa oncogenesis. Like themiR-15a/16-1cluster, several other miRNAs are located in the same chromosomal region. We recognised thatmiR-1andmiR-133aformed clusters in the human genome (18q11.2 and 20q13.33). Furthermore, our miRNA expression signatures revealed that bothmiR-1andmiR-133awere downregulated in several types of cancer such as head and neck cancer, oesophageal cancer, and bladder cancer (KanoNone, 2010;NohataNone, 2011a;YoshinoNone, 2011). In this study, we first tested the expression levels ofmiR-1andmiR-133ausing needle biopsies of PCa (n=15) and non-PCa (n=17) tissues. We confirmed reduction of both miRNAs in PCa tissues, and suggested that these changes are key steps in oncogenesis or progression in PCa. Next, we investigated the functional significance ofmiR-1andmiR-133ain PCa cells, PC3 and DU145. Our data revealed that restoration ofmiR-1ormiR-133aexpression suppressed cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in PC3 and DU145 cells. Our latest data from head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and bladder cancer showed thatmiR-1andmiR-133ahad a role of tumour suppressors based upon functional analysis of cancer cells (NohataNone, 2011b;YoshinoNone, 2011). As for the relationship between human cancer andmiR-1, recent articles revealed thatmiR-1induced apoptosis through repression ofMcl-1in lung cancer (NasserNone, 2008). miR-1also targetsc-Metin rhabdomyosarcoma (YanNone, 2009). With regard tomiR-133a, several reports showed thatmiR-133awas underexpressed in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, colon cancer and tongue SCC (SzafranskaNone, 2007;WongNone, 2008;SarverNone, 2009). In tongue SCC,miR-133ainhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis and directly bound to oncogenicPKM2(WongNone, 2008). Taken together,miR-1andmiR-133aappear to be important miRNAs, acting as tumour suppressors in several human cancers including PCa. miRNAs are unique in their ability to regulate many protein-coding genes. The elucidation of new networks of cancer is important for our understanding of oncogenesis. Based on this view, we continue our investigation of tumour suppressive miRNAs and their regulation of oncogenic targets in various cancer cells (KanoNone, 2010;ChiyomaruNone, 2010a,2011;FuseNone, 2011;NohataNone, 2011b;UchidaNone, 2011;YoshinoNone, 2011). In this study, we adopted a method of genome-wide gene expression analysis in PC3 and DU145 cells, usingmiR-1ormiR-133atransfectants to identify targets. Genes regulated by bothmiR-1andmiR-133awere identified by examining expression profiles ofmiR-1andmiR-133atransfectants. Recently, important articles were published regardingmiR-1andmiR-133atarget genes in rhabdomyosarcoma. The expression levels ofmiR-1andmiR-133awere reduced in cell lines of rhabdomyosarcoma. miR-1andmiR-133aregulate myogenesis by controlling distinct aspects of the differentiation process (RaoNone, 2006) and have important roles in the proliferation and differentiation of rhabdomyosarcoma (RaoNone, 2010). To investigate the contribution of two miRNAs in rhabdomyosarcoma cells, the expression signatures ofmiR-1andmiR-133atransfectants were reported (RaoNone, 2010). According to the report,miR-1exerts a strong promyogenic influence on these poorly differentiated tumour cells. The expression signatures of rhabdomyosarcoma and our current signatures were compared. In all, 23 of 62 (37.1%) and 5 of 24 (20.8%) downregulated genes bymiR-1andmiR-133atransfectants in rhabdomyosarcoma were recognised in our PCa signatures, respectively. This result indicates that the downregulated genes which are common in two signatures contribute to malignant human cells. In addition, the functional analysis ofmiR-1ormiR-133aindependently regulated genes is another important theme in cancer research field. In this study, we focused target genes directly downregulated by bothmiR-1andmiR-133a, which containmiR-1andmiR-133abinding site on their genome sequences. We investigated the mRNA expression levels of six candidate genes (TAGLN2,WDR78,C4orf34,PNP,LASS2, andSTXBP4) using PCa or non-PCa clinical specimens. In this analysis, our criterion for selection was that candidate genes were upregulated in cancer tissues. One gene,PNP, was chosen for this standard. To examine the role of PNP in PCa, we examined its expression by immunohistochemical analysis of tissue microarrays. Our data demonstrated that PNP was highly expressed in PCa while it was scarcely stained in normal prostatic tissues. Importantly, we noted intermediate staining of PIN tissues. Our immunohistochemical analysis indicates an important role of PNP in PCa oncogenesis. The phosphorolytic cleavage of inosine, deoxyinosine, guanosine, and deoxyguanosine to the corresponding base and sugar 1 phosphate was catalysed by PNP. Purine nucleoside phosphorylase-deficiency syndrome exhibits profound impairment in the T-cell component, in which 2'-deoxyguanosine accumulates in plasma and deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP) in lymphocytes, thereby leading to dGTP-directed inhibition of DNA synthesis and cell death (Markert, 1991;ArpaiaNone, 2000). Purine nucleoside phosphorylase is considered as a therapeutic target in malignant lymphoproliferative diseases. Forodesine (BCX-1777) is a potent inhibitor of human PNP and which induces apoptosis of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) cells (BantiaNone, 2003;Ravandi and Gandhi, 2006). Phase 2 clinical trials, conducted from 2005 until 2009, used Forodesine for the treatment of patients with advanced, Fludarabine-refractory CLL (Al-KaliNone, 2010;BalakrishnanNone, 2010). Purine nucleoside phosphorylase might have functions in oncogenesis and progression of PCa; therefore, PNP inhibition might be a target of a strategy for novel treatment of PCa. The unique point of miRNA biogenesis is that one miRNA regulates many protein-coding genes. However, the nature of miRNA-protein coding gene networks in human genome is unclear. This is why elucidation of tumour suppressivemiR-1andmiR-133aregulate cancer networks is important for understanding human PCa oncogenesis. miR-1andmiR-133aare frequently reduced in PCa clinical specimens. Both miRNAs may function as tumour suppressors regulatingPNP,an oncogenic gene in PCa. ThemiR-1andmiR-133acluster regulates novel cancer pathways and as such could provide new insights into molecular mechanisms of PCa oncogenesis and progression. Further studies could contribute to the development of new therapeutic strategies for PCa.
