Oxygen deprivation or hypoxia is a common feature in various physiological or pathophysiological states, including exercise, development, or cancer. Hypoxia has emerged as a pivotal factor in solid tumors due to overwhelming growth, inadequate blood supply, tumor progression, and resistance to therapy. Responses to hypoxia are orchestrated in part through activation of HIF (hypoxia-inducible factor). By controlling the transcription of hundreds of target genes, HIF regulates many cellular processes, such as angiogenesis, metabolism, cell migration, and tumor invasion. NoneRecent studies suggest that hypoxia activates autophagy, an evolutionarily conserved cellular catabolic process by which cells capture intracellular proteins and organelles and eliminate them through delivery to lysosomes. NoneAutophagy is vital in a range of physiological and pathological situations, and dysfunction in the autophagy pathway has been implicated in an increasing number of human diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and infection. None-NoneThe mechanistic target of rapamycin (MTOR), integrates and transmits signals from a diverse array of signaling pathways to regulate cell growth, metabolism, and ribosomal biogenesis, as well as autophagy. MTOR is part of 2 different protein complexes: rapamycin-sensitive MTORC1 and rapamycin-insensitive MTORC2, along with the regulatory-associated proteins RPTOR (regulatory-associated protein of MTOR, complex 1) and RICTOR (RPTOR independent companion of MTOR, complex 2). None,NoneUnder nutrient-rich conditions, activation of MTORC1 triggers a cascade of anabolic processes for cell growth and proliferation, mainly mediated by RPS6KB2 (ribosomal protein S6 kinase, 70 kDa, polypeptide 2/p70 S6 kinase) and EIF4EBP1 (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein 1). NoneConcomitantly, activation of MTORC1 also inhibits autophagosome formation through phosphorylating and inhibiting the ULK1-ATG13-RB1CC1-C12orf44/ATG101 complex. None-NoneBy contrast, MTORC2 is less well understood. It has been reported that MTORC2 activates AKT via phosphorylation and enhances the expression of HIF1A. None,NoneMicroRNAs (miRNAs) are the most widely studied class of noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression by blocking mRNA translation and/or mediating mRNA degradation. None,NonemiRNAs control diverse fundamental biological and pathological processes, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, and metabolism, and are also associated with cancer. None,None-NonemiRNA expression is often deregulated in cancer and miRNAs can act as oncogenes or tumor suppressors. Recently, miRNAs have been well characterized in the modulation of different autophagic stages. Autophagy induction is initiated by the ULK1 complex. MIR20AandMIR106Bimpede autophagy induction by leucine deprivation in C2C12 cells via directly targetingUlk1. NoneVesicle nucleation mainly involves the BECN1 (Beclin 1, autophagy related) complex. BECN1 itself is targeted byMIR30A,MIR376B, andMIR519A. None-NoneAdditional regulators of this step areMIR101,MIR630, andMIR374A, which targetRAB5AandUVRAG, respectively. None,NoneVesicle elongation is controlled by two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems. Several miRNAs, includingMIR30A,MIR181A,MIR374A,MIR630,MIR376B,MIR204,MIR375,MIR519A,MIR885-3P,andMIR-101, have been identified to regulate this process by targeting the expression of someATG(autophagy-related) genes. None,NoneTo date, most of the miRNAs primarily inhibit the autophagic process and function as negative regulators. MIR7is the only example of an miRNA that may induce autophagy. MIR7has been characterized as a tumor suppressive miRNA through negative regulation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT-MTOR pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma, which may account for the role in autophagy induction. NoneIn the present study, we report that hypoxia-inducedMIR155is a potent inducer of autophagy. Overexpression ofMIR155increases autophagic activity, while knocking down endogenousMIR155alleviates hypoxia-induced autophagy. Importantly, we demonstrated that 3 members of the MTOR pathway,RHEB,RICTORandRPS6KB2, are direct targets ofMIR155. By suppressing the activation of MTOR-AKT pathway,MIR155induces autophagy, decelerates cell proliferation and G1/S cell cycle progression. To investigate the function ofMIR155in hypoxia-induced autophagy, first we examined the expression ofMIR155in CNE and HeLa cells under hypoxic stress. As shown inFigure 1A, the expression level ofMIR155was low in normal culture conditions (21% oxygen). Hypoxia (1% oxygen) treatment induced a sustained upregulation ofMIR155in a time-dependent manner in both cell types. At 48 h after hypoxia treatment, more than a 12-fold increase of theMIR155expression level was detected. Figure 1. Hypoxia-inducedMIR155promotes autophagosome accumulation. (A) Hypoxia inducesMIR155expression. CNE or HeLa cells were exposed to 1% oxygen for 24, 36 and 48 h. Cells were collected for qRT-PCR to quantify the expression ofMIR155. (mean +/- s.d. of independent experiments, n = 4, *P less than 0.05, **P less than 0.01, ***P less than 0.001, Student 2-tailedttest). (B)MIR155promotes GFP-LC3 translocation. CNE or HeLa cells stably expressing GFP-LC3 were transfected with negative control (NC),MIR155orMIR203. Cells were fixed 48 h post transfection. Representative images are shown. Scale bar: 10 mum. (C) Quantitative analysis of GFP-LC3 puncta in (B). At least 200 cells were examined in each experimental group. Data shown are means +/- s.d. of four independent experiments. **P less than 0.01, Wilcoxon rank sum test. To explore the role ofMIR155in autophagy, we performed a GFP-LC3 puncta-formation assay and an LC3 conversion assay. MIR155was transfected into CNE or HeLa cells that stably expressing GFP-LC3 fusion protein, the localization of GFP-LC3 was examined by confocal microscopy. GFP-LC3 puncta appear in the cytoplasm reflects the recruitment of LC3 proteins to autophagosomes. As shown inFigure 1B, there was a significant increase of GFP-LC3 puncta inMIR155transfected cells. MIR203, a control miRNA that has no predicted targets in the autophagy pathway, behaved similarly to the negative control (NC) miRNA. The quantification of GFP-LC3 dots per cell confirmed that overexpression ofMIR155induced autophagosome accumulation in both CNE and HeLa cells (Fig. 1C). Next, we detected the conversion of LC3-I [cleaved, cytosolic form of MAP1LC3 (LC3)] to LC3-II (subsequently lipidated and membrane-bound form) by western blot. Consistent with the GFP-LC3 puncta formation assay,MIR155overexpression led to a significant upregulation of lipidated LC3-II (Fig. 2A and B). Thus, both assays suggest that overexpression ofMIR155induces autophagosome accumulation. Figure 2. Overexpression ofMIR155induces autophagic activity. (A) Overexpression ofMIR155induces LC3 conversion and SQSTM1 degradation. Western blots of control (NC) andMIR155-transfected cells. (B) ImageJ densitometric analysis of the LC3-II/GAPDH or (C) SQSTM1/GAPDH ratios from immunoblots (mean +/- s.d. of 4 independent experiments). *P less than 0.05, ***P less than 0.001, Student 2-tailedttest. (D) Overexpression ofMIR155increases autophagic flux. CNE or HeLa cells were transfected withMIR155orNC, BAF was applied to the medium for 1 h at 47 h post transfection, cells were harvested for western blot. (E) ImageJ densitometric analysis of the LC3-II/GAPDH or (F) SQSTM1/GAPDH ratios from immunoblots (mean +/- s.d. of 4 independent experiments). *P less than 0.05, **P less than 0.01, Student 2-tailedttest. To distinguish whether autophagosome accumulation is due to autophagy induction or rather a block in downstream steps, we performed autophagic flux assays. SQSTM1/p62, a polyubiquitin binding protein is selectively incorporated into autophagosomes through direct binding to LC3 and efficiently degraded during autophagy, thus the total cellular levels of SQSTM1 reflects the autophagic activity. We examined the intracellular amount of SQSTM1 by western blot, overexpression ofMIR155resulted in 20% to 40% reduction of SQSTM1 proteins in CNE and HeLa cells, suggesting thatMIR155promotes autophagic degradation (Fig. 2A and C). Finally, we performed an LC3 turnover assay. Cells were treated with the lysosomotropic reagent bafilomycin A1(BAF) to block autophagic degradation. BAF treatment caused significant increase of LC3-II in both NC andMIR155transfected cells (Fig. 2D and E). In addition, the protein levels of SQSTM1 inMIR155transfected cells were also upregulated by BAF (Fig. 2F). Therefore, these data demonstrate that overexpression ofMIR155increases autophagic activity. To document the physiological relevance ofMIR155on autophagy, we inhibited the expression of endogenousMIR155and repeated the above validation assays in both CNE and HeLa cells. LNA-derivedMIR155inhibitor was used to inhibit the high level of endogenousMIR155during hypoxia treatment. Hypoxia-induced GFP-LC3 puncta accumulation was dramatically suppressed by LNA-155 in both HeLa and CNE cells (Fig. 3A and B). Compared with LNA-NC control, SQSTM1 degradation during hypoxia treatment was also reduced upon LNA-155 transfection, reflecting a decrease of autophagic activity (Fig. 3C). Hence, these results demonstrate the physiological relevance of endogenousMIR155on regulating autophagy process during hypoxia treatment. Figure 3. Knockdown of endogenousMIR155inhibits hypoxia-induced autophagy. (A) Inhibition ofMIR155in hypoxia suppresses GFP-LC3 translocation. HeLa or CNE cells stably expressing GFP-LC3 were transfected with LNA-NC or LNA-155 and exposed to 1% oxygen. The number of GFP-LC3 puncta was quantified. (mean +/- s.d. of independent experiments, n = 4, *P less than 0.05,**P less than 0.01, Wilcoxon rank sum test). (B) Representative images from the quantification are shown. Scale bar: 10 mum. (C) Knockdown of endogenousMIR155inhibits autophagy. HeLa or CNE cells transfected with LNA-NC or LNA-155 were cultured in 1% oxygen for 36 h, cells were harvested for western blot. Protein ratio of SQSTM1/GAPDH was calculated following ImageJ densitometric analysis. (3 independent experiments gave similar results). Having established the role ofMIR155in autophagy, we next wanted to identify the direct targets ofMIR155. We used FindTar, a prediction algorithm designed by our laboratory, to clarify the potential targets ofMIR155in regulating autophagy. NoneFindTar predicted that several upstream or downstream regulators of the MTOR signaling pathway, includingRHEB,RPTOR,RICTOR,RPS6KB2, andMTORare potentialMIR155targets. Besides,BCL2andATG3were also putativeMIR155targets. We performed qRT-PCR to examine the mRNA levels ofMIR155putative targets. MIR155but not control miRNA, led to a significant attenuation of the mRNA levels ofRHEB. Other putativeMIR155target genes, however, did not show significant changes in both HeLa and CNE cells (Fig. 4A and B). Immunoblots with specific antibodies showed that the cellular levels of RHEB, RICTOR, RPS6KB2, and ATG3 proteins were decreased inMIR155-overexpressing cells (Fig. 4C). RHEB and RICTOR are reported to be positive regulators of MTORC1 and AKT; thus, we used phosphorylation site-specific antibodies to directly measure the activation of MTOR and AKT, including a phospho-Ser2448 antibody for MTOR and a phospho-Ser473 antibody for AKT. MIR155did not significantly change the total protein levels of MTOR and AKT; however, the phosphorylation status of these 2 proteins was significantly reduced (Fig. 4C). To validate, we also checked the mRNA and protein expression levels ofMIR155targetsRHEB,RICTOR,RPS6KB2, andATG3in CNE and HeLa cells that stably expressingMIR155by lentiviral infection. Similar to transient expression, stable transfection ofMIR155significantly suppressedRHEBmRNA levels in both CNE and HeLa cells. The mRNA expression ofRPS6KB2was also downregulated byMIR155in HeLa cells (Fig. S1A). Stable transfection ofMIR155suppressed the protein levels of RHEB, RPS6KB2, and RICTOR, as well as the phosphorylation of MTOR and AKT (Fig. S1B). Therefore, immunoblots from both transient and stable expression ofMIR155confirmed thatMIR155suppresses the expression of RHEB, RICTOR, RPS6KB2 and also downregulates MTOR-AKT signaling. Stable expression ofMIR155did not change the protein levels of ATG3, thus subsequent studies will concentrate on RHEB, RICTOR, and RPS6KB2. Figure 4. MIR155downregulates multiple players of MTOR signaling. (A) qRT-PCR analysis of mRNA expression levels of predicted targets ofMIR155. CNE or (B) HeLa cells were transfected withMIR155orNC, cells were harvested at 48 h for qRT-PCR. (mean +/- s.d. of independent experiments, n = 4, **P less than 0.01, ***P less than 0.001, Student 2-tailedttest). (C) Western blot analysis of RHEB, RICTOR, RPS6KB2, ATG3, MTOR, phospho-MTOR (Ser2448), RPTOR, BCL2, AKT, phospho-AKT (Ser473), and GAPDH proteins in CNE or HeLa cells transfected withMIR155,MIR203, orNC. Protein ratios were calculated following ImageJ densitometric analysis. (3 independent experiments gave similar results). MIR155is a hypoxia-inducible miRNA, thus we predicted that the protein levels ofMIR155targets will be downregulated by hypoxia. As shown inFigure S2, hypoxia treatment dramatically attenuated the protein expression levels of RHEB, RICTOR and RPS6KB2 in both CNE and HeLa cells. The total protein levels of MTOR also decreased 23% and 54% in HeLa and CNE cells under hypoxic stress. Similarly, the phosphorylation of MTOR was reduced by hypoxia treatment (Fig. S2). We reasoned whether knocking down functionally important target ofMIR155could phenocopy the effect ofMIR155on autophagy. Small GTP-binding protein RHEB is indispensable for MTOR activity by direct binding and activating MTOR kinase. None,NoneThus, we tested the effect ofRHEBsiRNA on autophagosome accumulation and LC3 conversion. Similar toMIR155overexpression, depletion of endogenousRHEBinduced a significant increase of GFP-LC3 puncta and LC3 conversion (Fig. S3). To clarify ifMIR155regulates the expression of target genes via direct interaction with their 3' UTRs, we used 2 bioinformatics softwares TargetScan and FindTar to predict the potential binding sequences in the 3' UTRs of target genes (Fig. 5A). Then we designed pRL-TK-luciferase reporter constructs containing either the wild-type (WT) or mutated (MUT)MIR155binding sequences in the 3' UTRs ofRHEB,RICTORandRPS6KB2. The pRL-TK-luciferase reporter constructs were cotransfected with eitherMIR155or NC control. Luciferase activity was determined at 24 h after transfection. MIR155significantly reduced luciferase activity when cells transfected with wild-type 3' UTRs ofRHEB,RICTORandRPS6KB2. By contrast, the inhibitory effect ofMIR155on luciferase activity was completely restored by the mutants (Fig. 5B). Moreover, the luciferase activity was also susceptible to knockdown of endogenousMIR155. Inhibition ofMIR155could specifically relieve the repression of all 3 reporters (Fig. S4). Figure 5. MIR155directly targetsRHEB,RICTORandRPS6KB2. (A) Predicted binding sequences betweenMIR155and seed matches inRHEB,RICTOR, andRPS6KB23' UTRs. (B) Luciferase reporter vectors were generated by inserting the wild-type or mutated 3'UTR fragments ofRHEB,RICTOR, andRPS6KB2into pRL-TK plasmid. Luciferase reporter assays at 24 h after transfection with wild-type (WT) or mutated (MUT) plasmids, cotransfected withNCorMIR155. Data shown are means +/- s.d. of independent experiments, n = 4, **P less than 0.01, ***P less than 0.001, Student 2-tailedttest. To test whether silencing endogenousMIR155would have an impact on target protein expression, we transfected cells with antagomir-155 (LNA-155) or nonspecific control antagomir (LNA-NC). Then, we checked the protein expression levels of RHEB, RICTOR, and RPS6KB2 by western blot. We showed that hypoxia induced downregulation of RHEB, RICTOR, and RPS6KB2 proteins. The amounts of all 3 proteins were increased when hypoxia-induced upregulation ofMIR155was suppressed by LNA-155. In addition, there was a clear increase of in the phosphorylation of MTOR (Ser2448) (Fig. 6;Fig. S5). In the light of these results, we demonstrate that endogenousMIR155targets the expression of MTOR signaling, and hence the autophagic activity. Figure 6. Blockage of endogenousMIR155led to an increase in RHEB, RICTOR, and RPS6KB2 protein levels. Western blot analysis of RHEB, RICTOR, RPS6KB2, MTOR, phospho-MTOR (Ser2448), and GAPDH in CNE or HeLa cells transfected with LNA-NC or LNA-155. Protein ratios were calculated following ImageJ densitometric analysis. (3 independent experiments gave similar results). Numerous studies demonstrate that MTOR signaling is essential for cell growth and proliferation. In this study, we discovered that overexpression ofMIR155could suppress the activation of MTORC1 and AKT. Thus, it is interesting to check whetherMIR155regulate cell proliferation and cell cycle progression. We observed that overexpression ofMIR155attenuated cell proliferation in both CNE and HeLa cells (Fig. 7A). Next, we examined the effect ofMIR155on cell cycle progression. HeLa cells transfected with NC orMIR155were synchronized at G1/S boundary by treatment with hydroxyurea. At 4 h after release from G1block, more than 70% of the control cells finished G1and entered S phase. Similarly,MIR885-5P, a control miRNA had no effect on G1/S cell cycle progression. By contrast, bothMIR155andRHEBsiRNA induced significant G1phase arrest (Fig. 7B). Then we tested whether the effect ofMIR155on autophagy contributes to G1phase cell cycle arrest. Cells were cotransfected withMIR155andATG5siRNA. Interestingly, depletion ofATG5relieved the inhibitory effect ofMIR155on G1/S cell cycle progression (Fig. 7B;Fig. S6). These data indicate a possible link between autophagy and cell cycle progression. Figure 7. MIR155decelerates cell proliferation and cell cycle progression. (A) Overexpression ofMIR155inhibits cell proliferation. CNE or HeLa cells transfected withMIR155orNCwere cultured for 24, 48, and 72 h to determine cell proliferation rates. Data shown are means +/- s.d. of independent experiments, n = 4, **P less than 0.01, Student 2-tailedttest. (B)MIR155induces G1/S cell cycle arrest. HeLa cells transfected with indicated miRNAs or siRNAs were synchronized at G1/S boundary by treatment with hydroxyurea. Cells were released from hydroxyurea block for 4 h, fixed and stained with propidium iodide (PI) for flow cytometry. Percentage of G1, S, and G2/M phase cells was quantified from flow cytometry analysis. Data shown are means +/- s.d. from 3 independent experiments. (C) Proposed model of hypoxia-inducedMIR155in regulating autophagy, cell proliferation, and cell cycle progression. MIR155is a hypoxia-inducible miRNA. MIR155targets the expression ofRHEB,RICTOR, andRPS6KB2, which in turns suppresses the activation of AKT and MTORC1. By deregulating the MTOR-AKT pathway,MIR155induces autophagy and decelerates cell proliferation and cell cycle progression. The tumor microenvironment plays a critical role in tumor cell proliferation and progression. As the tumor grows, it rapidly outgrows its blood supply, leaving tumor cells been deprived of oxygen. HIF is a key transcription factor that allows rapid adaptation to hypoxic stress. Hypoxia regulates the expression of a group of miRNAs in a cell type- and tissue-specific manner. None-NoneIn the present study, we identified hypoxia-inducedMIR155as a potent inducer of autophagy. We discovered that multiple players of MTOR signaling are novelMIR155targets, includingRHEB,RICTOR, andRPS6KB2. By suppressing the activation of MTOR-AKT pathway,MIR155induces autophagy, and attenuates cell proliferation and cell cycle progression. MTOR functions as a central sensor of cellular energy that responses to many oncogenic and metabolic events as well as the control of autophagy. Extensive studies indicate that regulation of MTOR pathway by miRNAs plays a major role in cancer progression. miRNAs either directly interact withMTORitself or target key players within the pathway, such asIGF1R(insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor),PI3K,AKT, andPTEN. For instance,MIR99A,MIR100,MIR101, andMIR199-3Pinhibit tumor cell migration and cell growth, induce G1phase cell cycle arrest by directly binding toMTOR3' UTR and suppressMTORexpression. None-NoneBy contrast, some miRNAs, includingMIR21,MIR221,MIR222,MIR26, andMIR19can function as oncomiR by targeting the expression ofPTENand promotes cancer cell growth, proliferation, and invasion. None-NoneMIR155targets,RHEBandRICTOR, are essential upstream regulators of MTORC1. The activity of MTORC1 is controlled through RHEB, a GTP-binding protein, which stimulates MTORC1 when it is in the GTP-bound state. None,NoneRICTOR is scaffold protein that regulating the assembly and substrate binding of MTORC2. NoneIt has been reported that MTORC2 activates AKT via phosphorylation and enhances the expression of HIF1A. None,NoneIn addition, AKT activates RHEB by negative phosphorylation of TSC1/TSC2 complex. A recent study by Wang et al. also reports that AKT-mediated BECN1 phosphorylation functions in autophagy inhibition. NoneThus,MIR155is a potent autophagy inducer by suppressing RICTOR- and RHEB-mediated MTORC1-AKT activity (Fig. 7C). Deregulation ofMIR155has been reported in a wide range of malignancies, including various forms of lymphoma and carcinomas of breast, lung, pancreas, head and neck, nasopharyngeal, and kidney. None-NoneSeveral lines of evidence demonstrate thatMIR155functions as an "OncomiR" and plays a role in tumor development. In human breast cancer cells,MIR155induces cell proliferation and chemosensitivity by targeting theSOCS1(suppressor of cytokine signaling 1) andFOXO3(forkhead box O3) genes. None,NoneIn human lung cancer cells,MIR155targets the expression ofAPAF1(apoptotic peptidase activating factor 1) andFOXO3, and downregulation ofMIR155enhances the sensitivity of lung cancer cells to cisplatin treatment or radiotherapy. NoneHowever, contradictory results exist concerning the oncogenic feature ofMIR155. In some circumstances,MIR155could exert a tumor suppression function. For example,MIR155is downregulated in the majority of melanoma cell lines, overexpression ofMIR155significantly inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis. NoneMIR155inhibits the growth of lung cancer 95D cells through the induction of G0/G1cell cycle arrest. NoneMIR155also inhibits proliferation and migration in human extravillous trophoblast derived HTR-8/SVneo cells via negative regulation of the CCND1-CDKN1B pathway. NoneHere we demonstrated that overexpression ofMIR155inhibits cell proliferation and G1/S cell cycle progression. This tumor-suppressive effect could be due toMIR155-mediated downregulation of RPS6KB2. Therefore, the function ofMIR155in physiological processes such as tumor development and tumor growth might be determined by its wide variety of targets in a cell type and tissue-specific manner. There is growing evidence for the role of autophagy in the control of cell proliferation, however, less is known about the relationship between autophagy and the cell cycle. It has been demonstrated autophagy regulatory protein ATG7 could bind to the tumor suppressor TP53 to regulate the transcription of cell cycle inhibitor CDKN1A [cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (p21, Cip1)]. Starved MEFs lacking theAtg7gene have impaired TP53-mediated cell cycle arrest. NoneIn U87 glioma cells, pharmacological inhibition of resveratrol-induced autophagy abrogates S-G2/M cell cycle arrest and significantly reduces the levels of CCNA, CCNE, CCNB, and phosphorylation of RB1 (Ser807/811) and CDC2 (Y15). NoneHere, we show that knockdown of the essential autophagy regulatorATG5could reverseMIR155-induced G1phase arrest, indicating thatMIR155-induced delay of cell cycle progression might be related to autophagy. More work is required to define the mechanisms of autophagy in the control of cell cycle progression. CNE (human nasopharyngeal cancer) or HeLa (human cervical cancer) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Gibco/Invitrogen Ltd, 12800-017) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (PAA, A15-101), 10 U/ml penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco/Invitrogen Ltd, 15140-122) in a 5% CO2-humidified incubator at 37 degrees C. Hypoxic conditions were induced by incubating cells in a modular incubator chamber flushed with a gas mixture containing 1% O2, 5% CO2, and 94% N2at 37 degrees C. For experiments involving hypoxia, cells were maintained in culture medium supplemented with 25 mM HEPES buffer. The conventional online programs, including Targetscan (http://www.targetscan.org) and Findtar (http://bio.sz.tsinghua.edu.cn) were used to predict the targets ofMIR155. NoneThe targets predicted by these 2 programs were further analyzed and demonstrated by the following biological experiments. All synthetic miRNAs (MIR155,MIR203,MIR885-5P), siRNAs and the negative control (NC) were purchased from Shanghai GenePharma Co. Ltd. LNA-NC and LNA-155 were purchased from Exiqon. For transfection, HeLa or CNE cells were transiently transfected with lipofectamineTM 2000 (Invitrogen, 11668-019) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The sequences of siRNAs are as follows:ATG5: 5'-GCAACUCUGG AUGGGAUUGTT-3', 5'-CAAUCCCAUC CAGAGUUGCTT-3',RHEB: 5'-GAAAGGGUGA UCAGUUAUGTT-3', 5'-CAUAACUGAU CACCCUUUC TT-3'. A fragment of pre-MIR155encompassing the stem-loop was amplified from CNE genomic DNA and cloned into lentiviral vector pBabi-globin-EGFP, a plasmid developed by our laboratory. MicroRNA fragment was inserted into the globin intron flanking the promoter andEGFP. A lentiviral vector expressing a scrambled RNA was used as control. To produce viruses, the pre-MIRexpression plasmid and the backbone plasmids were cotransfected into 293LTV cells using the calcium phosphate method. Supernatant containing the viruses were harvested at 48 h. Cells were infected with the viruses along with 8 ug/ml polybrene. The transfection efficiency was determined by monitoring EGFP expression using a fluorescence microscope (Leica DMI 6000B). HeLa GFP-LC3 stable cell line was established by transient transfection of pEGFP-LC3 plasmid following screening with G418 (Shanghai Sangon Biotech Co. Ltd, GDJ958). To obtain CNE GFP-LC3 stable cell line, we cloned CMV-GFP-LC3 to the pMSCV-neorand generated lentiviruses, CNE cells were infected with the viruses and selected stable clones with G418. CNE GFP-LC3 or HeLa GFP-LC3 stable cell lines were transfected with individual miRNAs or LNAs and fixed in dry methanol. GFP-LC3 puncta formation in normoxia or hypoxia conditions was determined by capturing images using Olympus FV1000 confocal microscope (Olympus). The number of GFP-LC3 dots per cell was counted from at least 200 cells. Total RNA was isolated using RNA iso Plus (Takara, D9108B). Real-time qRT-PCR was performed using reverse transcription kit (Takara, D6130) and SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Toyobo, QPK-201). mRNA level were normalized toGAPDH. miRNA qPCR were performed according to manufacturer's instructions using the Hairpin-itTM miRNA qPCR kit (Shanghai GenePharma Co. Ltd, QPM-091 forU6 snoRNA, QPM-040 forMIR155). Briefly, 4 ug total RNAs were reverse transcribed using mRNA specific RT primer, miRNA qPCR were performed using miRNA specific primer set to detect expression of matureMIR155. miRNA expression levels were normalized by Livak's method andU6snoRNA was used as endogenous control. Primers used in the present study were listed inTable S1. The 3' UTRs ofRHEB,RICTOR,andRPS6KB2were amplified by PCR from CNE genomic DNA and cloned into pRL-TK reporter vector (Promega, E2241). The predicted target site was mutated by site-directed mutagenesis. For luciferase reporter assays, the WT or MUT luciferase plasmids and miRNAs were cotransfected into HeLa cells and each experiment was repeated in triplicate. Transfected cells were lysed 30 h after transfection and luciferase activities were assayed by a Dual-Luciferase Reporter System (Promega, E1960). Total protein concentration of cell lysate was determined using Bradford assay (Bio-Rad, 500-0006) at 595 nm on a spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). The luciferase activity was normalized by total protein content. For synchronization, cells were treated with 2 mM hydroxyurea (Sigma, H8627) for 16 h. The synchronous cells were washed 3 times with PBS to release from G1block. At 4 h after release, cells were fixed in 70% ethanol in PBS and counterstained with 10 ug/ml propidium iodide (Sigma, P4170) and analyzed for DNA content by use of a BD InfluxTM flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Cells were lysed in ice-cold whole cell extract buffer (50 mM TRIS-HCl, pH 8.0, 4 M urea and 1% Triton X-100), supplemented with complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics, 04693132001). Cell extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by western blotting. Antibodies used for western blotting were as follows: MAP1LC3B/LC3B (Sigma, L7543), SQSTM1/p62 (BD Bioscience, 610832), HIF1A (BD Bioscience, 610958), GAPDH (Proteintech, 10494-1-AP), RHEB (Cell Signaling, 4935), RPS6KB2/p70S6K (Cell Signaling, 2708), RICTOR (Cell Signaling, 2114), phospho-MTOR (Ser2448) (Cell Signaling, 5536), MTOR (Cell Signaling, 2972), ATG3 (Cell Signaling, 3415), ATG5 (Cell Signaling, 8540), phospho-AKT (Ser473) (Cell Signaling, 9271), AKT (Cell Signaling, 4691), BCL2 (Cell Signaling, 2870), RPTOR (Cell Signaling, 2280). Following incubation with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary anti-mouse (KPL, 074-1806) or anti-rabbit antibodies (KPL, 474-1506), protein bands were visualized using ECL Blotting Detection Reagents (KPL, 54-61-00). Statistical significance of differences observed in samples was determined using the Wilcoxon rank sum test or the Student 2-tailedttest. Data were shown as means +/- s.d. of at least 3 independent experiments. Values ofP less than 0.05 were considered significant. Click here for additional data file.
