The establishment of sufficient beta-cell mass depends on the rapid expansion of beta-cell numbers during early postnatal life (1-5). The extent of this early postnatal beta-cell growth is postulated to influence later susceptibility to type 2 diabetes (6). Postnatal beta-cell mass expansion is driven by beta-cell proliferation (7), which is controlled by the cell cycle regulatorsCyclin D1orCyclin D2(encoded byCcnd1andCcnd2, respectively) (2,3). It has been shown that beta-cells are highly proliferative in the perinatal period and that this early proliferation is necessary to establish sufficient beta-cell mass for maintaining glucose homeostasis (1-5). However, the cell extrinsic and intrinsic factors that drive beta-cell proliferation and mass expansion during the perinatal period are still poorly defined. Glucose has been identified as a systemic factor that stimulates beta-cell proliferation (8,9), and recent studies suggest that glucose is a significant driver of early postnatal beta-cell proliferation (10). Furthermore, it has been shown that glucose metabolism in beta-cells produces signals that increaseCyclin D2expression and beta-cell proliferation (11-13). Independent of glucose, beta-cell proliferation is also stimulated by gut-derived hormone GLP-1 (Glp1), which is secreted by intestinal enteroendocrine cells in response to food intake (14,15). Thus there is an established link between feeding, increases in blood glucose levels, and beta-cell proliferation. However, beta-cells also exhibit significant proliferation during fetal life, when blood glucose concentrations are low and glucose has little effect on beta-cell proliferation (16). The distinct mechanisms used in prenatal and postnatal beta-cells to regulate proliferation remain unclear. The beta-cell-restricted transcription factor Nkx6.1 is essential for maintaining the functional state of beta-cells during adulthood (17). Both in vitro and in vivo experiments have suggested a role for Nkx6.1 in beta-cell proliferation (17-19), but whether it is required for beta-cell growth in vivo is unknown. To reveal a possible role for Nkx6.1 in beta-cell mass expansion, we inactivatedNkx6.1in newly formed beta-cells of the embryo and examined the effects on beta-cell proliferation and mass during the prenatal and postnatal period. RIP-Cre(20),Nkx6.1None(21),Nkx6.1null (22), andR26-YFPmice (23) have been described. RIP-Cre;Nkx6.1None;R26-YFPmice served as control mice in all experiments. All experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of California. Methods for tissue preparation, immunofluorescence staining, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nicked end labeling (TUNEL) have been previously described (21). The following primary antibodies were used: guinea pig anti-insulin (Dako), 1:2,000; mouse anti-Nkx6.1 (BCBC #2023), 1:500; rabbit anti-Glut2 (Millipore), 1:1,000; rabbit anti-Glp1r (S. Heller, Novo Nordisk), 1:2,000; rat anti-GFP (C. Kioussi, Oregon State University), 1:1,000; rabbit anti-Ki67 (Laboratory Vision), 1:500; rabbit anti-Ucn3 (M. Huising, University of California, Davis), 1:500; rabbit anti-MafA (Bethyl), 1:200; and rabbit anti-Pdx1 (Abcam), 1:500. Staining with antibodies raised in mice was performed using the M.O.M. Kit (Vector Laboratories). When necessary, nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (Sigma) at 0.1 mug/mL. Primary antibodies were detected with donkey-raised secondary antibodies conjugated to Cy3, Cy5, or Alexa 488 (Jackson ImmunoResearch). beta-Cell mass and marker+area were determined as described (21). Images were captured on a Zeiss Axio Observer Z1 microscope with an ApoTome module and processed with Zeiss AxioVision 4.8 software. All images were processed in accordance withDiabetesjournal guidelines. The quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis was performed as previously described (17) on total RNA isolated from postnatal day 2 pancreata from individual mice. Primers used are as follows: Nkx6.1 (f-CTTCTGGCCCGGAGTGATG; r-GGGTCTGGTGTGTTTTCTCTTC), Ucn3 (f-GCTGTGCCCCTCGACCT; r-TGGGCATCAGCATCGCT), Adh1 (f- GCAAAGCTGCGGTGCTATG; r-TCACACAAGTCACCCCTTCTC), Angptl7 (f- TGACTGTTCTTCCCTGTACCA; r-CAAGGCCACTCTTACGTCTCT), Dlk1 (f-CCCAGGTGAGCTTCGAGT; r-GGAGAGGGGTACTCTTGTTGAG), Gstm2 (f-ACACCCGCATACAGTTGGC; r-TGCTTGCCCAGAAACTCAGAG), Zyx (f-TCCCACCGCAGGTATCATC; r-GGAGCTAGAAGGGGTCTTCCA), and Gapdh (f-CATGTTCCAGTATGACTCCACTC; r-GGCCTCACCCCATTTGATGT). Glucose tolerance tests and blood glucose measurements were performed as described (17). For glucose tolerance tests, a 1.5 g/kg body weight intraperitoneal injection of glucose was administered after overnight fasting. All values are shown as mean +/- SEM;Pvalues were calculated using a two-tailed Studentttest in Microsoft Excel. P less than 0.05 was considered significant. To investigate the role of Nkx6.1 in perinatal beta-cell development, we intercrossed mice to generate progeny carrying aNkx6.1null allele (Nkx6.1-), aNkx6.1conditional loss of function allele (Nkx6.1None), and therat insulin2-Cretransgene (RIP-Cre). Additionally, the mice carried a conditionalYFPreporter gene targeted to theRosa-26locus (R26-YFP), resulting in heritable YFP expression uponRIP-Cre-mediated recombination of a translational stop signal. Thus, inRIP-Cre;Nkx6.1None;R26-YFP(hereafter referred to asNkx6.1None) mice, YFP labels all cells in whichNkx6.1has been inactivated (Fig. 1None). Nkx6.1deletion in newly formed beta-cells leads to glucose intolerance and reduced beta-cell mass. A: Schematic of alleles and transgenes used to inactivateNkx6.1in fetal beta-cells. Rectangles show coding sequences; triangles showloxPsites; red rectangle showsDsRedcoding sequence. BandC: Immunofluorescence staining for Nkx6.1 and insulin reveals loss of Nkx6.1 in most beta-cells ofNkx6.1Nonemice at P0. D: Blood glucose levels in 6-week-oldNkx6.1Nonemice fed ad libitum compared with control mice (n = 6). E: Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test shows glucose intolerance in 6-week-oldNkx6.1Nonemice as compared with control mice (n= 6). F: Quantification of beta-cell mass reveals decreased beta-cell mass inNkx6.1Nonemice at 6 weeks of age (n= 3). Data shown as mean +/- SEM. Scale bars = 20 mum. Ins, insulin; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein. *P less than 0.05; **P less than 0.01. Nkx6.1Nonemice were born with the expected Mendelian frequency (data not shown). Consistent with previous reports showing incomplete targeting of beta-cells by theRIP-Cretransgene (20), most but not all beta-cells were devoid of Nkx6.1 at birth (Fig. 1NoneandNone). At 6 weeks of age,Nkx6.1Nonemice exhibited significantly elevated blood glucose levels (Fig. 1None) and impaired glucose tolerance after intraperitoneal injection of a glucose bolus (Fig. 1None). To investigate whether Nkx6.1 deficiency affects postnatal beta-cell growth, we examined beta-cell mass inNkx6.1Nonemice. Compared with littermate controls, 6-week-oldNkx6.1Nonemice exhibited a 40% reduction in beta-cell mass (1.26 +/- 0.05 mg inNkx6.1Nonemice vs. 2.13 +/- 0.29 mg in controls) (Fig. 1None). Thus Nkx6.1 is necessary to establish appropriate beta-cell mass. To determine when beta-cell mass is first affected inNkx6.1Nonemice, we measured the relative insulin+area inNkx6.1Nonemice immediately after birth. In contrast to 6-week-old mice, beta-cell mass in neonatalNkx6.1Nonemice was indistinguishable from control mice (Fig. 2None), showing that Nkx6.1 is required for postnatal expansion but not for establishing prenatal beta-cell mass. Nkx6.1 is required for postnatal beta-cell mass expansion. A: Quantification of the insulin immunofluorescent area relative to total pancreatic area reveals no difference in beta-cell mass betweenNkx6.1Noneand control mice at P0 and a slight but not significant decrease at P4 (n= 3). B-G'': Immunofluorescence staining for insulin, Nkx6.1, and YFP at P0 (B-C''), P4 (D-E''), and 6 weeks of age (F-G''). H: Quantification of insulin+cells expressing YFP at P0, P4, and 6 weeks shows a progressive decrease of YFP+recombined beta-cells inNkx6.1Nonemice postnatally (n= 3). I: Quantification of insulin+cells expressing Nkx6.1 reveals a progressive increase of Nkx6.1-expressing unrecombined beta-cells inNkx6.1Nonemice between P0 and 6 weeks of age (n= 3). Data shown as mean +/- SEM. Scale bar = 20 mum. Ins, insulin; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein. *P less than 0.05; **P less than 0.01; ***P less than 0.001. BecauseRIP-Cre-mediated recombination of theNkx6.1Noneallele is mosaic and did not deleteNkx6.1in all beta-cells (Fig. 1None), both unrecombined Nkx6.1+and recombined Nkx6.1-deficient beta-cells can contribute to beta-cell growth inNkx6.1Nonemice. To investigate the contribution of recombined beta-cells to postnatal beta-cell mass expansion, we quantified the percentage of recombined beta-cells inNkx6.1Noneand control mice. In line with our observation that Nkx6.1 is dispensable for prenatal beta-cell growth (Fig. 2None), the percentage of recombined YFP+beta-cells was similar in newbornNkx6.1Noneand control mice (73 +/- 1.4% inNkx6.1Nonemice vs. 76 +/- 9.5% in control mice) (Fig. 2None-NoneandNone). Consistent with a slight decrease in overall beta-cell mass inNkx6.1Nonemice at postnatal (P) day 4 (Fig. 2None), a reduction in the percentage of recombined beta-cells was discernable inNkx6.1Nonemice by P4 (Fig. 2None-NoneNoneandNone). At 6 weeks of age, the reduction of YFP+beta-cells was highly significant (15 +/- 2.02% of beta-cells inNkx6.1Nonemice vs. 83 +/- 1.72% in control mice) (Fig. 2None-None). The decrease of YFP+beta-cells inNkx6.1Nonemice was accompanied by an age-dependent increase in the percentage of beta-cells expressing Nkx6.1 (Fig. 2None-NoneNoneandNone). Closely mirroring the reported 82% recombination efficiency of theRIP-Cretransgene (20), 27 +/- 1.41% of beta-cells expressed Nkx6.1 in newbornNkx6.1Nonemice (Fig. 2None). This percentage increased significantly to 40 +/- 3.75% at P4 (Fig. 2None). These findings indicate that a selective disadvantage becomes apparent for Nkx6.1-deficient beta-cells shortly after birth. We next investigated whether the postnatal beta-cell growth defect inNkx6.1Nonemice is caused by reduced beta-cell proliferation and/or survival. First, we examined the possibility that Nkx6.1 deficiency causes increased beta-cell apoptosis by performing TUNEL assays on pancreatic sections. Virtually no TUNEL+beta-cells were detected in eitherNkx6.1Noneor control mice at P4 (Fig. 3None-None), indicating that apoptosis does not account for the negative selection of Nkx6.1-deficient beta-cells. By contrast, analysis of beta-cell proliferation by immunofluorescence staining for Ki67, insulin, and YFP inNkx6.1Nonemice at P4 revealed reduced numbers of Ki67+beta-cells (Fig. 3None-None). Quantification of Ki67+YFP+beta-cells showed a threefold decrease in beta-cell proliferation in 4-day-oldNkx6.1Nonecompared with control mice (4.48 +/- 1.01% inNkx6.1Nonemice vs. 13.00 +/- 1.58% in control mice) (Fig. 3None). Consistent with our finding thatNkx6.1inactivation does not affect prenatal beta-cell growth (Fig. 2None), the frequency of Ki67+beta-cells did not differ betweenNkx6.1Noneand control mice at P0 (2.67 +/- 1.14% inNkx6.1Nonemice vs. 1.78 +/- 1.05% in control mice) (Fig. 3None-NoneNoneandNone). Thus Nkx6.1 is required for beta-cell proliferation and expansion during early postnatal life but is dispensable prenatally. Furthermore, the effect ofNkx6.1deletion on beta-cell proliferation is cell autonomous, as revealed by comparing proliferation rates between recombined and unrecombined beta-cells inNkx6.1Nonemice at P4 (4.48 +/- 1.01% YFP+insulin+cells vs. 11.0 +/- 0.93% YFP-insulin+cells expressed Ki67) (Fig. 3None). Nkx6.1 is required for postnatal beta-cell proliferation. A-C: beta-Cells are not apoptotic at P4 inNkx6.1Noneor control mice based on TUNEL combined with immunofluorescence staining for insulin and DAPI. TUNEL+cells in the pancreas are shown as a positive control (arrowheads) and TUNEL+insulin+cells were quantified. D-G''': Immunofluorescence staining for insulin, Ki67, and YFP at P0 and P4. H: Quantification of the percentage of insulin+YFP+cells expressing Ki67 shows decreased beta-cell proliferation inNkx6.1Nonemice at P4, but not at P0 (n= 3). I: Quantification of Ki67-expressing YFP+insulin+cells and YFP-insulin+cells inNkx6.1Nonemice at P4 reveals a selective decrease in proliferation of recombined compared with unrecombined beta-cells within the same animal (n= 3). Data shown as mean +/- SEM. Scale bar = 20 mum. Ins, insulin; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein. *P less than 0.05; **P less than 0.01. To determine whether loss of Nkx6.1 affects other beta-cell markers, we performed immunofluorescence staining for Pdx1 and MafA. While Pdx1 was unaffected, MafA was lost in recombined Nkx6.1-deficient beta-cells (Fig. 4None-None'''). We further assessed whether Nkx6.1 regulates beta-cell maturation markers. To this end, we selected genes found to be significantly changed between immature and mature postnatal beta-cells (24) and performed qRT-PCR analysis on pancreata from control andNkx6.1Nonemice at P2, when beta-cell mass is similar betweenNkx6.1Noneand control mice (Fig. 2None). Of these genes,Ucn3, Adh1,Gstm2, andZyxwere expressed at significantly lower levels inNkx6.1Nonemice, whileAngptl7andDlk1were unchanged (Fig. 4None-None'''). These results suggest that Nkx6.1 regulates a subset of genes associated with beta-cell maturation. Given the postnatal onset of the beta-cell proliferation defect inNkx6.1Nonemice, we next investigated whether Nkx6.1-deficient beta-cells are able to receive feeding-induced signals that stimulate beta-cell proliferation. We analyzed the expression of Glut2 and the Glp1 receptor (Glp1r), which are known to have a role in the regulation of postnatal beta-cell growth (14,16). In accordance withGlut2being a direct Nkx6.1 target gene (17),Nkx6.1Nonemice exhibited a selective loss of Glut2 expression only in recombined beta-cells (Fig. 4None-None'''). Similarly, recombined beta-cells displayed a cell autonomous reduction in Glp1r expression (Fig. 4None-None'''). The cell autonomous role of Nkx6.1 in regulating beta-cell proliferation, Glut2, and Glp1r expression argues against an Nkx6.1-dependent paracrine or systemic factor affecting beta-cell proliferation inNkx6.1Nonemice. These findings demonstrate that Nkx6.1-deficient beta-cells lack key sensors for extrinsic stimuli of postnatal beta-cell growth. Nkx6.1inactivation leads to a cell autonomous loss of beta-cell maturation and nutrient sensing markers. Immunofluorescence staining for insulin, Pdx1, and YFP (A-C''') or insulin, MafA, and YFP (D-F''') shows Pdx1 but not MafA expression in recombined YFP+insulin+cells ofNkx6.1Nonemice at P4. Unrecombined YFP-insulin+cells express Pdx1 and MafA inNkx6.1Nonemice. G: qRT-PCR analysis of pancreata fromNkx6.1Noneand control mice at P2 for genes associated with beta-cell maturation (n= 3). Immunofluorescence staining for insulin, Ucn3, and YFP (H-J'''); insulin, Glut2, and YFP (K-M'''); or insulin, Glp1r, and YFP (N-P''') shows loss of Ucn3, Glut2, and Glp1r expression in recombined YFP+insulin+cells but not in unrecombined YFP-insulin+cells ofNkx6.1Nonemice at P4. For each marker, representative areas are shown in lower panels forNkx6.1Nonemice, as indicated by a dashed box in the merged middle panel. White arrowheads point to recombined YFP+insulin+cells and blue arrowheads to unrecombined YFP-insulin+cells. Data shown as mean +/- SEM. Scale bar = 20 mum. Ins, insulin; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein. *P less than 0.05; **P less than 0.01. The role of Nkx6.1 in beta-cell proliferation has been controversial. While in vitro studies have suggested a direct role of Nkx6.1 in stimulating beta-cell proliferation through the regulation ofCyclingene expression (18), in vivo overexpression of Nkx6.1 in beta-cells showed no effect on beta-cell proliferation or mass (19). Moreover, we have recently reported that beta-cell-specific inactivation ofNkx6.1in adult mice has no overt effect on beta-cell mass (17). However, due to the extremely low proliferation rate of beta-cells in adult animals (1), the role of Nkx6.1 in beta-cell mass expansion could not be rigorously tested in this model. By ablatingNkx6.1in newly formed beta-cells of the embryo, we here show that postnatal beta-cell proliferation and mass expansion depends on Nkx6.1 activity. We found that Nkx6.1-deficient beta-cells begin to exhibit reduced proliferation between P0 and P4, which manifests in a measurable decrease in the contribution of Nkx6.1-deficient beta-cells to beta-cell mass as early as P4. We have previously reported that Nkx6.1 deficiency leads to a loss of beta-cell identity and, ultimately, their conversion into delta cells (21). It is important to note that this fate conversion occurs later and is not yet observed at P4 (seeFig. 2None-None''; all YFP+cells express insulin). Thus the reduced contribution of Nkx6.1-deficient beta-cells to beta-cell mass is caused by the proliferation defect and cannot be attributed to a beta-to-delta-cell fate conversion. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing analysis, we have recently shown that Nkx6.1 does not bind toCyclingene regulatory regions (17). Therefore, Nkx6.1 is likely an indirect regulator of beta-cell proliferation. Consistent with this idea, our current work shows that prenatal beta-cell proliferation is unaffected inNkx6.1Nonemice. Interestingly, we found that the onset of reduced beta-cell proliferation inNkx6.1Nonemice coincides with birth and thus the beginning of food intake, suggesting that Nkx6.1 could enable beta-cells to respond to nutrient-dependent inducers of beta-cell proliferation. Supporting this notion,Nkx6.1-deleted beta-cells fail to express two important nutrient sensors, Glut2 and Glp1r. At the transition from prenatal to postnatal life, glucose becomes an important stimulus of beta-cell proliferation (16) and similar toNkx6.1Nonemice, Glut2-deficient mice exhibit reduced beta-cell proliferation during the early postnatal period (25). Since Glp1 regulates beta-cell proliferation independent of glucose (15), loss of Glut2 and Glp1r inNkx6.1Nonemice likely have additive effects on beta-cell proliferation. In addition to regulating nutrient sensors, we found that Nkx6.1 also regulates several markers associated with postnatal beta-cell maturation (24). It is still largely unclear whether and how these genes affect beta-cell maturation, but the regulation of several of these genes by Nkx6.1 suggests a role for Nkx6.1 in beta-cell maturation. Collectively, our results demonstrate that Nkx6.1 controls multiple relevant pathways for postnatal beta-cell development.
