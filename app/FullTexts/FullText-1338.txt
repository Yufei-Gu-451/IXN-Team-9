Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common cancer in the world and approximately about 500 000 cases are diagnosed every year (JemalNone, 2010). In spite of considerable advances in multimodality therapy, including surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, the overall 5-year survival rate for patients with HNSCC is only 40%-50% (Haddad and Shin, 2008). Local tumour recurrence and distant metastasis after conventional therapy appear to be major contributing factors for restricted survival of HNSCC patients (LeemansNone, 2011). Therefore, understanding the molecular cancer pathways underlying HNSCC would help to improve diagnosis, approaches to therapy and prevention of the disease. The discovery of non-coding RNA in the human genome was an important conceptual breakthrough in the post-genome sequencing era (Mattick, 2004). Improved understanding of non-coding RNA is necessary for continued progress in cancer research. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) constitute a class of small, non-coding RNA molecules, 19-22 nucleotides in length, which modulate gene expression. This is achieved through imperfect pairing with target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) of protein-coding genes and transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulation of their expression (Bartel, 2004). Currently, 2042 human mature miRNAs are registered at miRBase release 19.0 (http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk/). A growing body of evidence indicates that miRNAs also contribute to the initiation and development of various types of cancers (Esquela-Kerscher and Slack, 2006). Many human cancers show aberrant expression of miRNAs that can function either as tumour suppressors or oncogenes (Esquela-Kerscher and Slack, 2006). In cancer pathways, normal regulatory mechanisms are disrupted by altered expression of tumour-suppressive or oncogenic miRNAs. Therefore, identification of differentially expressed miRNAs is an important step to understanding human oncogenesis. Recently, a maxillary sinus squamous cell carcinoma (MSSCC) miRNA expression signature revealed thatmicroRNA-874(miR-874) was significantly downregulated. Moreover, restoration ofmiR-874inhibited cell proliferation in a MSSCC cell line, IMC-3 (NohataNone, 2011c). To the best of our knowledge, this is the only investigation ofmiR-874in cancer biology. The aim of this study was to investigate the functional significance ofmiR-874and identify the molecular pathways and responsible genes it regulated in HNSCC cells. Genome-wide gene expression analysis ofmiR-874transfectants andin silicodatabase analysis showed that the cell cycle was a promising candidate target ofmiR-874. Furthermore,histone deacetylase 1(HDAC1) was a candidate target ofmiR-874regulation. Histone deacetylase 1belongs to the family of HDACs and is a component of the HDAC complex. It also interacts with retinoblastoma tumour-suppressor protein and this complex is essential for cell proliferation and differentiation (Giacinti and Giordano, 2006). Several studies indicated that HDAC inhibitors (HDACis) are a new class of cytostatic agents that inhibit the proliferation of tumour cells in culture andin vivoby inducing cell cycle arrest, differentiation and/or apoptosis (Cruz and Matushansky, 2012;Popovic and Licht, 2012). We focused onHDAC1as a putativemiR-874 targetand investigated the functional significance ofHDAC1in HNSCC. Tumour-suppressive miRNA-modulated cancer pathways provide new insights into the potential mechanisms of HNSCC oncogenesis and suggest novel therapeutic strategies for treatment of the disease. Twenty-three pairs of primary HNSCC and corresponding normal epithelial samples were obtained from patients with HNSCC in Chiba University Hospital (Chiba, Japan) from 2005 to 2011. The samples considered normal were free of cancer cells by pathologic examination. The patient's backgrounds and clinicopathological characteristics are summarised inTable 1. The patients were classified according to the 2002 Union for International Cancer Control TNM staging criteria (Sobin and Wittekind, 2002) before treatment. Written consent of tissue donation for research purposes was obtained from each patient before tissue collection. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Chiba University. The specimens were immersed in RNAlater (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) and stored at -20 degrees C until RNA was extracted. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically, and molecular integrity was checked by gel electrophoresis. RNA quality was confirmed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The following cell lines were used: human HNSCC; SAS (derived from a primary lesion of tongue SCC), FaDu (derived from a primary lesion of hypopharyngeal SCC), HSC3 (derived from a metastatic lymph node of tongue SCC), IMC-3 (derived from a primary lesion of maxillary sinus SCC), human fibroblast; MRC-5. All cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2at 37 degrees C.We investigated the effects of the demethylation agent (5-Aza-dC) treatment (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) on HNSCC and fibroblast cell lines (SAS, FaDu, HSC3, IMC-3 and MRC-5). Cells were treated with 5 muM of the 5-Aza-dC, and cells harvested after 72- or 120-h treatment. Experiment manner was as described previously (EnokidaNone, 2004). The difference expression status ofmiR-874andHDAC1was evaluated by real-time PCR methods as follows using before and after 5-Aza-dC treatments. The following mature miRNAs species were used in this study: hsa-miR-874, Ambion Pre-miR, PM12355 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and miRIDIAN Mimics, MIMAT0004911 (Thermo Scientific Dharmacon, Waltham, MA, USA). The following siRNAs were used: Stealth Select RNAi siRNA; si-HDAC1_1 Cat# HSS104726 and si-HDAC1_2 Cat# HSS179192 (Invitrogen), and negative control miRNA/siRNA (Applied Biosystems, P/N: AM17111). RNAs were incubated with OPTI-MEM (Invitrogen) and LipofectamineTM RNAiMax reagent (Invitrogen) as described previously (IchimiNone, 2009). Transfection efficiency of miRNA in cell lines was confirmed based on downregulation ofTWF1(PTK9) mRNA following transfection withmiR-1as previously reported (IchimiNone, 2009). Cells were transfected with 10 nM miRNA and siRNA by reverse transfection and plated in 96-well plates at 3 * 103cells per well. After 72 h, cell proliferation was determined with the XTT assay, using the Cell Proliferation Kit II (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) as previously reported (ChiyomaruNone, 2010). Triplicate wells were measured for cell viability in each treatment group. Cell cycle status and apoptosis were examined using an APC BrdU Flow kit (BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. SAS and FaDu cells transiently transfected with miR-control,miR-874, si-control or si-HDAC1were harvested 72 h after transfection by trypsinisation. Experiments were done in triplicate. To gain further insight into which genes were affected bymiR-874, we performed genome-wide gene expression analysis usingmiR-874transfectants of SAS and FaDu cells. Oligo-microarray human 4 * 44K (GPL10332) (Agilent Technologies) was used for gene expression analysis; the experimental procedure was described previously (SugimotoNone, 2009). To identify the biological processes or pathways potentially regulated bymi-874, we performed GENECODIS analysis (Carmona-SaezNone, 2007;Nogales-CadenasNone, 2009;http://genecodis.cnb.csic.es/) with our microarray results. Then, to assess the networks regulated bymiR-874and their target genes, we analysed and characterised those genes in KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) Pathway Database (KanehisaNone, 2012). First-strand cDNA was synthesised from 1 mug of total RNA using a High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems). Gene-specific PCR products were assayed continuously using a 7900-HT Real-Time PCR System according to the manufacturer's protocol. The initial PCR step consisted of a 10-min hold at 95 degrees C, followed by 40 cycles consisting of a 15-s denaturation at 95 degrees C and a 1-min annealing/extension at 63 degrees C. TaqMan probes and primers for,BUB3(P/N: Hs00190920_m1),CCNE1(P/N: Hs01026536_m1),CDC23(P/N: Hs00946641_m1),CDC25B(P/N: Hs01550934_m1),HDAC1(P/N: Hs02621185_s1) andGAPDH(P/N: Hs02758991_g1) as an internal control were obtained from Applied Biosystems (Assay-On-Demand Gene Expression Products). The expression levels ofmiR-874(assay ID: 002268) were analysed by TaqMan quantitative real-time PCR (TaqMan MicroRNA Assay; Applied Biosystems) and normalised toRNU48(assay ID: 001006). The delta delta Ct method was adopted and applied to calculate the relative quantities of subject genes. All reactions were performed in triplicate, and included negative control reactions that lacked cDNA. Cells were harvested 72 h after transfection and lysates were prepared. In all, 50 mug of protein lysate was separated by Mini-PROTEAN TGX gels (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and transferred to PVDF membranes. Immunoblotting was performed with diluted (1 : 1000) rabbit HDAC1 antibody (600-401-879; Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA, USA), with GAPDH antibody (ab8245, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) used as an internal control. The membrane was washed and incubated with a goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L)-HRP conjugate (Bio-Rad). Complexes were visualised with an Immun-Star WesternC Chemiluminescence Kit (Bio-Rad), and the expression levels of these genes were evaluated by ImageJ software (ver.1.44;http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/). Partial wild-type sequences ofHDAC13'-UTR and those with deletedmiR-874target sites (positions 149-155) were inserted between theXhoI-PmeI restriction sites in the 3'-UTR of the hRluc gene in psiCHECK-2 vector (C8021; Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Sequences of oligonucleotides were described inSupplementary document 1. The synthesised DNA was cloned into the psiCHECK-2 vector. SAS cells were transfected with 15 ng of vector, 10 nM ofmiR-874(Applied Biosystems), and 1 mul of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in 100 mul of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen). The activities of firefly and Renilla luciferases in cell lysates were determined with a dual-luciferase assay system (E1910; Promega). Normalised data were calculated as the quotient ofRenilla/firefly luciferase activities. The relationships between two groups and the numerical values obtained by real-time RT-PCR were analysed using the pairedt-test. The relationship among three variables and numerical values was analysed using the Bonferroni adjusted Mann-WhitneyU-test. All analyses were performed using Expert StatView (version 4, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). The expression levels ofmiR-874were significantly lower in 23 clinical HNSCC specimens than those in corresponding adjacent non-cancerous specimens (P=0.0012). We also evaluated the expression levels ofmiR-874in two HNSCC cell lines (SAS and FaDu). The expression levels ofmiR-874in these two cell lines were much lower than those in non-cancerous epithelial cells (Figure 1A). To investigate the functional effects ofmiR-874, we performed gain-of-function studies using miRNA transfection of SAS and FaDu cell lines. We utilised two sources of maturemiR-874(Ambion and Thermo Scientific Dharmacon) to ensure reproducibility of the data. The XTT assay demonstrated that cell proliferation was significantly inhibited inmiR-874transfectants in comparison with the mock or miR-control transfectant cells. Specifically, we observed the following growth, expressed as a percentage of the control: (1) SAS - mock, 100.0+/-1.5; miR-control, 103.5+/-1.5;miR-874(Ambion), 20.2+/-2.6;miR-874(Thermo Scientific Dharmacon), 20.5+/-0.6 and (2) FaDu - mock, 100.0+/-1.7; miR-control, 107.3+/-1.1;miR-874, 36.8+/-2.5;miR-874(Thermo Scientific Dharmacon), 36.6+/-2.3, withP less than 0.01 for both (Figure 1B). AsmiR-874restoration significantly inhibited cell proliferation in SAS and FaDu cells, we hypothesised that their restoration induced cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis. This hypothesis was tested by flow cytometry. With regard to the cell cycle distribution, the fraction of cells in the G2/M phase was significantly larger inmiR-874transfectants in comparison with the mock (bothP less than 0.0167,Figure 2A). These results suggested thatmiR-874restoration induced G2/M arrest in both cell lines. The sub-G0/G1 apoptotic cell fraction was significantly larger inmiR-874transfectants (2.9-fold in SAS and 1.3-fold in FaDu) than in the mock and miR-control (bothP less than 0.01,Figure 2B). Flow cytometric data are shown inSupplementary Figure 1. To gain further insight into molecular mechanisms and pathways regulated by tumour-suppressivemiR-874in HNSCC, we performed genome-wide gene expression analysis usingmiR-874transfected cells,miR-874-SAS andmiR-874-FaDu. Entries from the microarray data were approved by the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and were assigned GEO accession number GSE37119. A total of 1071 and 591 genes were downregulated less than -0.5 (log2ratio) inmiR-874-SAS andmiR-874-FaDu transfectants, respectively, compared with control cells. These genes were analysed and characterised in KEGG pathway categories by the GENECODIS 3.0 program. The GENECODIS analysis categorised 59 and 13 significantly enriched signalling pathways in themiR-874-SAS andmiR-874-FaDu transfectants, respectively (Table 2a and b). We focused on the 'cell cycle' pathway and the 15 genes listed within this pathway (Table 3). Of those 15 genes, five (budding uninhibited by benzimidazoles 3 homolog:BUB3, cyclin E1:CCNE1, cell division cycle protein 23 homolog:CDC23, cell division cycle protein 25 homolog B:CDC25Band HDAC 1:HDAC1) were downregulated by transfection ofmiR-874in both SAS and FaDu cells, and contained putative binding sites ofmiR-874in their 3'-UTR by TargetScan database (Table 3). Our strategy for selection ofmiR-874target genes is shown inFigure 3. In cancer pathways, normal regulatory mechanisms can be disrupted by altered expression of tumour-suppressive or oncogenic miRNAs. We hypothesised that downregulation ofmiR-874led to overexpression of oncogenic genes in HNSCC clinical specimens. To support this hypothesis, we investigated the two independent gene expression analyses, one is deposited in GEO database, accession number is GSE9844, and the other is our own expression data by using real-time RT-PCR. First, we screened the expression of those 5 candidates and other 10 genes in HNSCC clinical samples using data deposited in GEO (accession number GSE9844) by another research group. We noted thatCCNE1,HDAC1,CDC25B,CDC23andBUB3were upregulated in cancer tissues compared with normal epithelia (Table 4andSupplementary Figure 2). Next, we used real-time RT-PCR to measure the mRNA expression levels of five candidate genes in HNSCC clinical specimens. Four genes (BUB3,CCNE1,CDC23andCDC25B) were not upregulated in cancer tissues (Figure 4). In contrast,HDAC1was significantly upregulated in cancer tissues compared with adjacent normal epithelia (P=0.0077,Figure 4). Therefore, we focused on theHDAC1gene as a possible target gene regulated bymiR-874in HNSCC and subjected it to further experiments. We performed quantitative real-time RT-PCR and western blotting to investigate whether HDAC1 expression was downregulated by restoration ofmiR-874. The mRNA and protein expression levels of HDAC1 were significantly repressed inmiR-874-transfectants in comparison with mock or miR-control transfectants (P less than 0.01,Figures 5A and B). We performed a luciferase reporter assay to determine whetherHDAC1mRNA had a target site formiR-874. We used a vector encoding either the partial sequence of the 3'-UTR ofHDAC1mRNA, including the predictedmiR-874target site (positions 149-155) or a vector lacking themiR-874target site. We found that the luminescence intensity was significantly reduced by transfection of the wild type 3'-UTR ofHDAC1while deletion of positions 149-155 blocked the decrease in luminescence (P less than 0.01,Figure 5C). HNSCC and fibroblast cells were subjected to real-time RT-PCR to evaluate the expression levels ofmiR-874andHDAC1. At baseline, expression levels of themiR-874were negative in all cell lines. However, after 5-Aza-dC treatment, the expression levels ofmiR-874were significantly increased in all cell lines. Conversely, the expression levels ofHDAC1mRNA were significantly decreased by 5-Aza-dC treatment. Inverse correlation was recognised betweenmiR-874andHDAC1expression after 5-Aza-dC treatment (Supplementary Figure 3). This data suggested that demethylation restored the expression ofmiR-874in HNSCC and fibroblast cells and that reduction of theHDAC1expression was caused by recovery for expression ofmiR-874in cancer cells. To investigate the functional role ofHDAC1, we performed loss-of-function studies using si-HDAC1transfectants. First, we evaluated the knockdown efficiency of si-HDAC1treatments. The expression levels ofHDAC1mRNA were repressed in two si-HDAC1transfectants in comparison with mock and si-control transfectants (P less than 0.01,Figure 6A). Moreover, the expression levels of HDAC1 protein were repressed in si-HDAC1-1 and the si-HDAC1-2 transfectants in comparison with mock and si-control transfectants (Figure 6B). These results showed that the two siRNAs were effective for loss-of-function assays in this study. The XTT assay revealed significant inhibition of cell proliferation in the two different si-HDAC1transfectants in comparison with growth of the mock and si-control transfectants. The following was observed, expressed as a percentage of control proliferation: mock, 100+/-4.2; si-control, 93.7+/-5.6; si-HDAC1_1, 74.7+/-6.4; si-HDAC1_2, 38.4+/-0.9,P less than 0.01;Figure 7A. As for the cell cycle distribution, the fractions of cells in the G1/G0 and G2/M phases were significantly larger in si-HDAC1transfectants in comparison with the si-control (P less than 0.0167,Figure 7B), and the sub-G0/G1 apoptotic cell fraction was significantly larger (3.0-fold) in si-HDAC1transfectants than in the si-control in SAS cells (P less than 0.01,Figure 7C). Flow cytometric data are shown inSupplementary Figure 4. Despite considerable advances in cancer treatment, the overall survival rate of HNSCC patients has not markedly improved. Therefore, it is necessary to pursue new concepts to enhance treatment results and to develop new therapeutic strategies. For elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying HNSCC, we examined miRNA expression, focusing on its regulated molecular targets and novel cancer pathways based on HNSCC expression signatures (KikkawaNone, 2010;NohataNone, 2011c). Our recent studies demonstrated thatmiR-1,miR-133a,miR-218,miR-375andmiR-489were significantly reduced in HNSCC clinical specimens. Moreover, they functioned as tumour suppressors through their targeting of several oncogenic genes in HNSCC cells (KikkawaNone, 2010;MutallipNone, 2011;NohataNone, 2011a,2011b,2011c,2011d,2011e;KinoshitaNone, 2012a,2012b,2012c,2012d). Our previous study of MSSCC miRNA expression signature showed thatmiR-874was the most downregulated miRNA and significantly inhibited cancer cell proliferation in IMC-3 cells derived from MSSCC. We also identified putative targets ofmiR-874 by genome-wide gene expression analysis andPPP1CAwas a direct target ofmiR-874in MSSCC cells (NohataNone, 2011c). The overexpression ofPPP1CAwas observed in oral cancer cell lines (HsuNone, 2006) and this protein may act as an oncogene since dephosphorylated BRCA1 as breast and ovarian tumour suppressor is considered to be inactive form (LiuNone, 2002). The identification of tumour-suppressive miRNA-mediated novel cancer pathways is the first step to consider the effective and promising strategy for miRNA-based therapeutics for the treatment of human cancers. Except for our previous report, there are no data to suggest a relationship betweenmiR-874and human cancers. Thus, we believed that analysis ofmiR-874could lead to discoveries of new molecular mechanisms in HNSCC. First, we evaluated the expression level ofmiR-874in HNSCC clinical specimens that were obtained from the oral cavity, larynx and pharynx. We confirmed thatmiR-874was significantly downregulated in tumour tissues. The elucidation of silencing mechanisms of tumour-suppressive miRNAs will contribute to miRNA-based cancer therapies in near future. We performed preliminary analysis of molecular mechanism ofmiR-874silencing in HNSCC cells. Our data demonstrated thatmiR-874was re-expressed by treatment of 5-Aza-dC, suggesting that silencing ofmiR-874in cancer cells was caused by epigenetic modification especially methylation of CpG island located on the upstream ofmiR-874genomic locus (Supplementary Figure 3). Further detailed analysis is necessary to understand the molecular mechanism ofmiR-874silencing in cancer cells. Next, we investigated the functional significance ofmiR-874in HNSCC using two cell lines, SAS and FaDu. In this study, we used two kinds of miRNA to evaluate the function ofmiR-874. Restoration of maturemiR-874in cancer cells revealed significant inhibition of cancer cell proliferation, suggestingmiR-874is indeed a new tumour suppressor in HNSCC. It is likely that further analysis will provide added insight into HNSCC oncogenesis. miRNAs are unique in their ability to regulate many protein-coding genes. Bioinformatic predictions indicate that miRNAs regulate greater than 30% of protein-coding genes (FilipowiczNone, 2008). We have taken the position that identification of novel cancer pathways and responsible genes regulated by tumour-suppressivemiR-874is an important first step in understanding HNSCC oncogenesis. Based on this view, we performed genome-wide gene expression analysis ofmiR-874transfectants (miR-874-SAS andmiR-874-FaDu) andin silicoanalysis. A single miRNA is capable of targeting a number of genes to regulate biological processes globally. In fact, 1060 and 587 genes were downregulated inmiR-874-SAS andmiR-874-FaDu transfectants, respectively. We used GENECODIS analysis to reveal the functional significance of the genes potentially regulated bymiR-874in HNSCC. GENECODIS analysis applies many genes to known pathways in the KEGG Pathway Database and these data facilitate understanding of tumour-suppressive miRNA-mediated molecular pathways in human cancer. We devised this method of analysis and found that tumour-suppressive miRNA could efficiently regulate cancer-associated pathways (FuseNone, 2012;KinoshitaNone, 2012a). In this study, we focused on the 'cell cycle' pathway because restoration ofmiR-874inhibited cancer cell proliferation in HNSCC cell lines. The expression signatures ofmiR-874transfectants in HNSCC cells andin silicoanalysis revealed that five genes (BUB3,CCNE1,CDC23,CDC25BandHDAC1) were involved in the 'cell cycle' pathway and that they were candidate targets ofmiR-874regulation. Out of the five genes,HDAC1was significantly upregulated in HNSCC clinical specimens as assessed by both our real-time RT-PCR analysis and HNSCC gene expression data deposited in GEO. We further focused onHDAC1as a responsible gene in HNSCC and investigated the functional significance of the gene. Our luciferase reporter assay demonstrated thatmiR-874directly regulatedHDAC1in HNSCC cells. It has been shown thatHDAC1is directly regulated bymiR-449ain prostate cancer (NoonanNone, 2009) and lung cancer (JeonNone, 2012). The seed sequence of maturemiR-449ais identical to that ofmiR-34families, which are well known as p53-responsive genes and tumour suppressors through regulating HDACSIRT1, cyclin-dependent kinases, cyclins and E2Fs (Hermeking, 2010). Recent miRNA researches suggest that one of the reasons why HDACs is overexpressed in various cancers might be downregulation of miRNAs acting as endogenous HDACis (DattaNone, 2008;NasserNone, 2008;NoonanNone, 2009;JeonNone, 2012). Histone deacetylases remove acetyl groups from histones and other nuclear proteins that induce chromatin condensation and transcriptional repression (HaberlandNone, 2009). HDACs have important roles in aberrant epigenetic changes related to human malignant diseases (Marks, 2010). HDAC1is upregulated in several types of cancer, such as lung (SasakiNone, 2004), gastric (ChoiNone, 2001), breast (ZhangNone, 2005), prostate (WeichertNone, 2008a), liver (RikimaruNone, 2007) and colorectal cancers(WeichertNone, 2008b), and it correlates with poor prognosis. HDACis have been watched with keen interest in cancer therapy because aberrant expressions of HDACs are frequent events (Glozak and Seto, 2007;Marks, 2010). Vorinostat and romidepsin have been approved recently for the treatment of refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, and clinical trials of other HDACis are in progress in other lymphomas (GrantNone, 2007). This is the first report that upregulation ofHDAC1is caused by downregulation of tumour-suppressivemiR-874in HNSCC cells. Future work onmiR-874involving its targeting of oncogenic pathways and its targeting of oncogenes may lead to better understanding of HNSCC oncogenesis and development of new therapeutic strategies for HNSCC. Downregulation ofmiR-874was a frequent event in HNSCC. miR-874inhibited cancer cell proliferation through direct targeting ofHDAC1, suggesting thatmiR-874is a new tumour-suppressive miRNA. Tumour-suppressivemiR-874appears to modulate cancer-associated pathways. The recognition thatmiR-874target oncogenes may lead to better understanding of HNSCC oncogenesis and the development of new therapeutic strategies for HNSCC.
