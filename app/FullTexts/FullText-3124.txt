Increasing evidence indicates that chronic low-grade inflammation is important for the development of diabetic retinopathy (1,2). Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta) are proinflammatory molecules upregulated in this disease (3,4). Macrophages/microglia in the diabetic retina express TNF-alpha (4). Moreover, both cytokines contribute to diabetes-induced degeneration of retinal capillaries, a hallmark of diabetic retinopathy (5,6). In addition to macrophages/microglia, Muller cells (the major retinal macroglia) become dysfunctional in diabetes and contribute to the development of diabetic retinopathy (7). However, little is known about whether Muller cells enhance proinflammatory responses in macrophages/microglia in diabetes. CD40 is an important driver of retinal inflammation in experimental diabetic retinopathy (8,9). CD40 is upregulated in retinal Muller cells, endothelial cells, and microglia in diabetic mice (8). CD40 ligation in Muller cells and endothelial cells upregulates intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) (8,9). CD40 ligation in monocytes/macrophages/microglia upregulates TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, inducible nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2), and CCL2 (10-12). CD40 drives ICAM-1 and CCL2 upregulation, increases protein nitration and the number of leukocytes adherent to blood vessel walls (leukostasis) in the retina of diabetic mice, and is required for the development of capillary degeneration (8,9). CD40 in hematopoietic cells has been considered central to the development of inflammatory diseases. Although studies using bone marrow chimeras suggest that CD40 expressed in nonhematopoietic cells is also required for inflammation (13), it is not known whether expression of CD40 restricted to the nonhematopoietic compartment is sufficient for development of inflammatory disorders. Using transgenic mice with expression of CD40 in Muller cells, we report that after induction of diabetes, CD40 expression in these nonhematopoietic cells was sufficient for inflammatory molecule upregulation and development of capillary degeneration. TNF-alpha was upregulated in macrophages/microglia rather than in Muller cells. CD40 ligation in Muller cells induced macrophages to secrete TNF-alpha and IL-1beta via an ATP-P2X7receptor pathway. Pharmacologic or genetic inhibition of the P2X7receptor in diabetic mice impaired not only TNF-alpha and IL-1beta upregulation but also upregulation of ICAM-1 and NOS2, molecules reported to be driven by TNF-alpha and/or IL-1beta. Thus, CD40 in Muller cells orchestrates inflammatory responses in macrophages/microglia and promotes the development of experimental diabetic retinopathy. Mouse CD40 construct was inserted into theEcoRI andBamHI sites of the pTetOSplasmid (14). After sequence verification, the transgene was excised bySalI digestion (14) and microinjected into mouse oocytes (B6). Founder TetOS-CD40 mice were identified by PCR using the following primers: TetOSCD40 forward: 5'-GCAACGTGCTGGTTATTGTG-3', reverse: 5'-CCGGGACTTTAAACCACAGA-3'. The driver line consisted of transgenic mice that express tetracycline (Tet)-repressible transactivator (tTA) under the control of the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) promotergfa2consisting of the 2.2 kb of 5'-flanking DNA of human GFAP (15). Homozygous TetOS-CD40 (responder) and heterozygous GFAP-tTA (driver) transgenic mice (15) (both B6) were backcrossed onto a CD40-/-(B6) background. To confirm that transgenic mice were CD40-/-, animals were genotyped using primers that detect wild-type CD40 and mutant CD40 (neomycin cassette inserted into exon 3 resulting in lack of functional CD40) (16). Both lines of mice were bred and offspring identified by PCR analysis of genomic DNA. PCR primers for CD40 and tTA were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory. Littermates that inherited only one transgene (single transgenic and nonexpressing) served as controls (Trg-Ctr) for double transgenic animals (Trg-CD40; expressing GFAP promoter-specific CD40 expression). Mice were made diabetic using streptozotocin (STZ). Fasted mice (20-25 g body weight) received five daily intraperitoneal injections of STZ (55 mg/kg; MP Biomedicals). Development of diabetes (blood glucose greater than 250 mg/mL) was assessed beginning 1 week after the first injection of STZ. Glycated hemoglobin was measured at 2 months (VARIANT Classic; Bio-Rad). Mice were weighed weekly and, if needed, received insulin to prevent weight loss while maintaining chronic hyperglycemia (target range 350-500 mg/mL). The dose given (0-0.2 units of NPH insulin subcutaneously, 0-3 times per week) was determined individually for each animal. The insulin requirement was similar for all groups of diabetic mice. Studies adhered to the institutional guidelines for humane treatment of animals,Principles of Laboratory Animal Care(National Institutes of Health) and to theStatement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Visual Research(Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology). Studies were approved by the Case Western Reserve University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The number of leukocytes adherent to the retinal microvasculature was determined at 2 months of diabetes. After perfusion with PBS, fluorescein-coupled concanavalin A lectin (20% g/mL; Vector Laboratories) was infused (17). Retinal flat mounts were analyzed using fluorescence microscopy, and brightly fluorescent leukocytes were counted. Retinal vasculature was isolated and stained with periodic acid Schiff (8). Eight areas in the mid retina were examined blindly under original magnification *400. Degenerate capillaries were defined as capillary-sized tubes of material positive for periodic acid Schiff without nuclei along the capillary. Samples were processed blindly. Paraffin-embedded eyes fixed with formalin-free zinc fixative (24 h; BD Biosciences) were treated with proteinase K or citrate buffer (8-12 sections per mouse) (8). Antibodies are listed in theSupplementary Data. Retinas were analyzed using a Leica DMI 6000B epifluorescence microscope. Real-time PCR was performed as described using primers for ICAM-1 (8), CCL2 (9), TNF-alpha (18), IL-1beta (19), NOS2 (20), P2X7receptor (21), and 18S rRNA (8). Retinal cell suspensions were obtained and permeabilized as described (22). Antibodies are listed in theSupplementary Data. CD40 expression is expressed as the corrected mean fluorescence intensity (22). Primary human Muller cells obtained as described (8) and the human Muller cell line MIO M1 (gift from Dr. Gloria Limb, University College London, London, U.K.; both greater than 95% vimentin+, cellular retinaldehyde binding protein [CRALBP]+and GFAP-) were transduced with a retroviral vector that encodes human CD40 or an empty vector (9). The Muller cell lines mRAST and rMC1 (mouse and rat, respectively) were transduced with a retroviral vector that encodes hmCD40. Muller cells were incubated with multimeric human CD154 to induce CD40 stimulation (obtained from Dr. Richard Kornbluth, Multimeric Biotherapeutics Inc., La Jolla, CA) or with a nonfunctional CD154 mutant (T147N) as the control (13). Cells were also incubated with recombinant FLAG-tagged CD154 (CD40L) plus enhancer (anti-FLAG antibody) or enhancer alone (Enzo Life Sciences). In certain experiments, Muller cells were incubated with BAPTA-AM (1,2-Bis[2-aminophenoxy] ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid tetrakis[acetoxymethyl ester]; 25 mumol/L; Sigma Aldrich), the phospholipase C inhibitor U73122, or the inactive analog U73343 (1 mumol/L; Tocris Bioscience). Human Muller cells were also cultured with the human monocytic cell line MonoMac6 pretreated with interferon-gamma (100 IU for 48 h), with or without the P2X7receptor inhibitor A-438079 (10 mumol/L; Tocris Bioscience). Mouse Muller cells were incubated with bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM) from B6 or P2X7-/-mice plus sodium polyoxotungstate (10 mumol/L) to inhibit the ectonucleotidase CD39 expressed in BMM. MonoMac6 and BMM were pretreated with lipopolysaccharide (100 ng/mL) for 4 h in studies of IL-1beta secretion. MonoMac6 cells were transfected with human P2X7small interfering (si)RNA or control siRNA (Qiagen) usingTransIT-X2 (Mirus). The ecto-ATPase inhibitor beta,gamma-methylene-ATP (300 mumol/L; Sigma-Aldrich) was added 15 min before stimulation with CD154. Extracellular ATP was quantified using an ATP bioluminescence assay kit and an ATP standard curve (Sigma-Aldrich) (23). Membranes were probed with antibody to P2X7receptor, actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), total phospholipase Cgamma1 (PLCgamma1; Cell Signaling), or phospho-Tyr783 PLCgamma1 (Cell Signaling). Human IL-1beta, human TNF-alpha, rat TNF-alpha, mouse IL-1beta, and TNF-alpha (all from eBioscience), human CCL2, mouse CRP (both R D Systems), and CD154 (Boster Bio) were measured using ELISA. Results are expressed as the mean +/- SEM. Data were analyzed by two-tailed Studentttest or ANOVA. Differences were considered statistically significant atP less than 0.05. We examined the effect of diabetes on serum CD154 (CD40 ligand) levels. Serum CD154 concentrations were significantly increased in mice made diabetic using STZ, whereas CRP levels remained unchanged, and TNF-alpha was undetectable ( less than 3.9 pg/mL) (Supplementary Fig. 1). Diabetic mice are reported to upregulate CD40 in retinal Muller cells, and diabetic CD40-/-mice are protected from experimental diabetic retinopathy (8). To examine the role of CD40 expressed in Muller cells in experimental diabetic retinopathy, we used a binary transgenic mouse system to obtain CD40-/-mice where CD40 expression is rescued in retinal Muller cells. The driver line consisted of mice expressing the tTA under the control of the human GFAP promotergfa2(GFAP-tTA mice). These mice (B6 background) were backcrossed with CD40-/-mice (also B6 background). The responder line consisted of homozygous CD40-/-mice containing mouse CD40 cloned downstream of the TetOSpromoter (Supplementary Fig. 2None). After mating GFAP-tTA mice with TetOSCD40 animals, double-transgenic offspring (Trg-CD40) are predicted to exhibit rescued CD40 expression in retinal macroglia. In contrast, no such rescue should occur in single-transgenic mice carrying the GFAP-tTA or TetOSCD40. PCR analysis of genomic DNA identified Trg-Ctr or Trg-CD40 mice (Supplementary Fig. 2None). Trg-CD40 mice expressed CD40 in vimentin+cells (Muller cells), whereas Trg-Ctr animals lacked CD40 expression (Supplementary Fig. 2None). Flow cytometry analysis of vimentin+cells confirmed that rescue of CD40 occurred in Trg-CD40 but not in Trg-Ctr mice and that levels of CD40 expression in vimentin+cells were similar in B6 and Trg-CD40 mice (Supplementary Fig. 2None). Staining with an antibody against CRALBP, a specific Muller cell marker, confirmed that CD40+cells from Trg-CD40 mice were Muller cells (Supplementary Figs. 2Noneand 3None). The pattern of GFAP expression was the same in B6 and transgenic mice and was detected in astrocytic processes present in the ganglion cell layer (Supplementary Fig. 2None). These results are in agreement with evidence that the GFAP promoter drives gene expression in Muller cells independently of endogenous GFAP gene activity (24). Moreover, GFAP+astrocytes lacked detectable CD40 (Supplementary Fig. 2None) because expression driven by the GFAP transgene is lost in astrocytes from adult mice (24). Selective localization of CD40 in Trg-CD40 mice was further confirmed using immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry by the lack of detectable CD40 expression in the other retinal cells that express CD40 in wild-type mice: endothelial cells, microglia/macrophages, and ganglion cells, as well as lack of CD40 expression in leukocytes (Supplementary Figs. 2Noneand 3NoneandNone). Thus, the transgenic system results in mice with CD40 rescue in Muller cells rather than astrocytes. Male B6, CD40-/-, Trg-Ctr, and Trg-CD40 mice were rendered diabetic using STZ. Blood glucose concentrations, HbA1clevels, and body weights of diabetic mice were similar (P greater than 0.5) (Supplementary Table 1). ICAM-1 expression is elevated in the diabetic retina (17) and promotes leukostasis (25,26). Compared with nondiabetic mice, ICAM-1 mRNA levels were increased in diabetic Trg-CD40 and B6 mice but not in diabetic Trg-Ctr or CD40-/-mice (Fig. 1None). Diabetic B6 and Trg-CD40 mice showed increased ICAM-1 expression in retinal capillaries compared with nondiabetic controls (Fig. 1None). In contrast, diabetic CD40-/-and Trg-Ctr mice did not exhibit increased ICAM-1 expression (Fig. 1None). CD40 expression in Muller cells from diabetic mice promotes upregulation of ICAM-1 in the retina and vascular changes of early diabetic retinopathy. A: At 2 months of diabetes, retinas from diabetic B6, CD40-/-, Trg-Ctr, and Trg-CD40 mice (DM) as well as from nondiabetic (ND) control animals were collected and used for mRNA extraction. mRNA levels of ICAM-1 were assessed by real-time quantitative PCR using 18S rRNA as the internal control. One nondiabetic B6 mouse was given an arbitrary value of 1, and data are expressed as the fold-increase compared with this animal. The horizontal bars represent mean +/- SEM (n= 8-13 animals per group). B: At 2 months of diabetes, retinal sections were incubated with anti-ICAM-1 monoclonal antibody and tomato lectin (n= 6 mice/group). GCL, ganglion cell layer; INL, inner nuclear layer; IPL, inner plexiform layer. Arrowheads show blood vessels with increased ICAM-1 expression. Scale bar, 10 mum. C: At 2 months of diabetes, adherent leukocytes in the retinal vasculature of diabetic and nondiabetic control mice were quantified by labeling with concanavalin A. Representative image shows an adherent leukocyte (arrowhead) within the vasculature of a diabetic B6 mouse. D: At 8 months of diabetes, retinal digests were examined for the presence of degenerate capillaries. The horizontal bars represent the mean +/- SEM (n= 6-10 animals per group). Representative image shows an acellular capillary (arrow) in the retinal digest of a diabetic B6 mouse. **P less than 0.01, ***P less than 0.001 by ANOVA. Next, we determined whether diabetic Trg-CD40 mice develop increased retinal leukostasis. Diabetic Trg-CD40 and B6 mice showed a significant increase in the numbers of adherent leukocytes (Fig. 1None). Degenerate capillaries are a central feature of diabetic retinopathy. Diabetic B6 mice exhibited the expected increase in degenerate capillaries compared with nondiabetic animals, whereas diabetic mice lacking CD40 were protected from capillary degeneration (Fig. 1None). Diabetic Trg-CD40 animals showed increased degeneration of retinal capillaries similar to that seen in diabetic B6 mice (Fig. 1None). Thus, CD40 in Muller cells promotes ICAM-1 upregulation in the diabetic retina and vascular changes of early diabetic retinopathy. TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, NOS2, and likely CCL2 play a pathogenic role in diabetic retinopathy (3,5,6,27-30). We examined the effects of Muller cell CD40 on mRNA levels of these molecules. In contrast to diabetic Trg-Ctr mice, diabetic Trg-CD40 animals upregulated TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, NOS2, and CCL2 mRNA levels (Fig. 2). Thus, expression of CD40 on Muller cells drives upregulation of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, NOS2, and CCL2 mRNA in the retina of diabetic mice. CD40 expression in Muller cells from diabetic mice (DM) restores upregulation of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, NOS2, and CCL2 mRNA in the retina. At 2 months of diabetes, retinas from diabetic B6, CD40-/-, Trg-Ctr, and Trg-CD40 mice and from nondiabetic (ND) control animals were collected and used for mRNA extraction. mRNA levels were assessed by real-time quantitative PCR using 18S rRNA as the internal control. One nondiabetic B6 mouse was given an arbitrary value of 1, and data are expressed as the fold-increase compared with this animal. The horizontal bars represent the mean +/- SEM (n= 7-15 animals per group). *P less than 0.05, **P less than 0.01 by ANOVA. We examined the effects of CD40 stimulation on TNF-alpha and IL-1beta production by Muller cells. CD40 expression in Muller cells is upregulated in diabetes (8). However, in agreement with other nonhematopoietic cells, primary Muller cells and Muller cell lines have very low levels of CD40 expression in vitro under basal conditions. To test whether CD40 ligation caused TNF-alpha and/or IL-1beta secretion, we induced CD40 expression by transducing Muller cells with a CD40-encoding retroviral vector, an approach well suited to study the effects of CD40 signaling (9,11). CD40+primary human Muller cells or the CD40+human Muller cell line MOI-M1 failed to secrete TNF-alpha in response to CD154 (CD40 ligand) (Supplementary Fig. 4None). Although human Muller cells also failed to secrete IL-1beta in response to CD154, a marked upregulation in CCL2 was detected (Supplementary Fig. 4None). We tested whether similar findings apply to Muller cells from rodents. The rat Muller cell line rMC-1, which expresses a chimera of the extracellular domain of human CD40, and the intracytoplasmic domain mouse CD40 (hmCD40) was incubated with human CD154. These cells upregulated ICAM-1 in response to human CD154, but TNF-alpha secretion was not detected (Supplementary Fig. 4None). Mouse Muller cells that express hmCD40 also failed to secrete TNF-alpha and IL-1beta (Fig. 4None). Thus, CD40 stimulation of Muller cells does not increase TNF-alpha and IL-1beta secretion. We examined CCL2 and TNF-alpha expression by immunohistochemistry. CCL2 was detected in the end feet and stalks of Muller cells from diabetic Trg-CD40 mice but not in diabetic Trg-Ctr mice or nondiabetic animals (Fig. 3NoneandNoneandSupplementary Fig. 5None). In contrast, no TNF-alpha was detected in Muller cells from diabetic Trg-CD40 mice or mice from any other group (Fig. 3NoneandSupplementary Fig. 5None). Interestingly, TNF-alpha was observed in microglia/macrophages (Iba-1+cells) from diabetic Trg-CD40 mice (Fig. 3NoneandNone). Analysis of multiple retinal sections revealed that 15% of microglia/macrophages in diabetic Trg-CD40 mice were TNF-alpha+(Fig. 3None). Thus, the presence of CD40 in Muller cells from diabetic mice drives CCL2 upregulation in Muller cells and upregulation of TNF-alpha in microglia/macrophages. Diabetic transgenic mice that express CD40 in retinal Muller cells upregulate CCL2 in Muller cells and TNF-alpha in microglia/macrophages. AandB: Retinal sections from diabetic Trg-Ctr and Trg-CD40 mice at 2 months of diabetes and from nondiabetic controls were incubated with anti-CCL2 plus anti-CRALBP antibody. CCL2 expression at the level of Muller cell end feet (ganglion cell layer) (A) and at the level of Muller cells stalks (outer plexiform layer) (B). C: Sections were incubated with anti-TNF-alpha plus anti-CRALBP antibody. Muller cell end feet and stalk areas are shown. DandE: Retinal sections were incubated with anti-TNF-alpha monoclonal antibody plus anti-Iba-1 antibody. D: Sections were analyzed to determine the percentages of Iba-1+cells in diabetic mice (DM) and nondiabetic (ND) mice that were stained with anti-TNF-alpha antibody. ***P less than 0.001. E: Images represent microglia/macrophages present in the inner plexiform layer (n= 4 mice/group). Scale bars, 10 mum. We tested whether CD40-activated Muller cells induce IL-1beta and TNF-alpha production in bystander monocytes/macrophages. We used monocytic cells that lack CD40 (MonoMac6) to avoid the effects of direct CD40 ligation on these cells. Similar to Muller cells, monocytic cells failed to secrete IL-1beta and TNF-alpha in response to CD154 (Fig. 4None). In contrast, the addition of CD154 to coculture of CD40+human Muller cells with monocytic cells enhanced IL-1beta and TNF-alpha production (Fig. 4None). Cytokine production was driven by CD40 because IL-1beta and TNF-alpha secretion were not significantly increased in cultures that contained Muller cells that were largely CD40-(Fig. 4None). CD40-activated Muller cells secrete ATP and induce P2X7receptor-dependent production of cytokines by monocytic cells and macrophages. A: Control human Muller cell (transduced with empty retroviral vector MIEG3) and CD40+human Muller cells (transduced with CD40-encoding retroviral vector MIEG3-CD40) were incubated with CD40-human monocytic cell lines (MonoMac6) with or without CD154. Cytokines were measured in supernatants by ELISA at predetermined optimal time points (24 h for IL-1beta and 4 h for TNF-alpha). B: Human Muller cell line was incubated with or without CD154. Concentrations of extracellular ATP at time 0 and at 15 min of incubation are shown. C: CD40+Muller cells were incubated with CD154 and concentrations of extracellular ATP were measured at different times. D: Mouse Muller cells transduced with the hmCD40-encoding retroviral vector were incubated with or without human CD154. CD40+human Muller cells were incubated with MonoMac6 cells with or without CD154 in the presence or absence of the P2X7receptor inhibitor A-438079, and IL-1beta (E) and TNF-alpha (F) were measured in supernatants by ELISA. CD40+human Muller cells were incubated with MonoMac6 cells transfected with control or P2X7receptor siRNA, and IL-1beta (G) and TNF-alpha (H) were measured in supernatants by ELISA. I: Mouse Muller cells that express hmCD40 were incubated with BMM from B6 or P2X7-/-mice, and IL-1beta (I) and TNF-alpha (J) were measured by ELISA. Results are presented as mean +/- SEM (n= 3). *P less than 0.05, **P less than 0.01, ***P less than 0.001 by Studentttest. Secretion of ATP by astrocytes has been proposed to cause purinergic receptor-driven IL-1beta production by microglia (31). To determine whether purinergic signaling mediates IL-1beta and TNF-alpha production during the Muller cells/monocytic cells coculture, we tested whether CD40 ligation in Muller cells increases secretion of extracellular ATP. CD40+human Muller cells incubated with CD154 exhibited increased ATP release that was noted after 15 min of stimulation (Fig. 4NoneandNone). Similar results were observed in mouse Muller cells (Fig. 4None). Extracellular ATP binds purinergic receptors, among which P2X7is central to IL-1beta secretion (32). The addition of a specific P2X7receptor inhibitor (A-438079) to CD40+human Muller cells and monocytic cells ablated the enhanced IL-1beta production triggered by CD154 (Fig. 4None). It appeared unlikely that the P2X7receptor inhibitor acted on Muller cells because they did not exhibit detectable functional P2X7receptor (Supplementary Fig. 6None). To confirm that monocytes but not Muller cells were responsible for cytokine production, cells were incubated with a purinergic receptor ligand. 3'-O-(4-benzoyl)benzoyl (Bz)-ATP (100-300 mumol/L) enhanced cytokine production by monocytic cells but not by Muller cells (Supplementary Fig. 6None). In contrast to IL-1beta, P2X7receptor inhibitor did not decrease TNF-alpha production triggered by addition of CD154 to CD40+human Muller cells cultured with monocytic cells (Fig. 4None). Similarly, knockdown of the P2X7receptor in monocytic cells impaired IL-1beta production but not TNF-alpha when these cells were incubated with CD40+Muller cells plus CD154 (Fig. 4NoneandNone). Of relevance, although P2X7receptor is central to IL-1beta secretion, other P2 receptors in monocytic cell lines induce TNF-alpha production (33). Next, we examined the role of P2X7receptor in cytokine production by primary mouse macrophages. Whereas mouse hmCD40+Muller cells or mouse BMM failed to secrete IL-1beta or TNF-alpha when incubated with human CD154, incubation of hmCD40+Muller cells plus BMM resulted in increased IL-1beta and TNF-alpha production after human CD154 stimulation (Fig. 4None). No significant increase in cytokine production was noted when BMM from P2X7-/-mice were used (Fig. 4None). Thus, CD40-activated Muller cells secrete extracellular ATP and induce P2X7receptor-mediated cytokine production in monocytes/macrophages. ATP can be released after an increase in intracytoplasmic Ca2+(34), and CD40 elevates intracytoplasmic Ca2+levels (35,36). We examined the effects of BAPTA-AM (chelator of intracellular Ca2+) on ATP release. Incubation with BAPTA-AM impaired CD40-mediated ATP release in Muller cells (Fig. 5None). Next, we examined whether CD40 ligation in Muller cells causes phosphorylation of PLCgamma1, a signaling molecule that increases intracytoplasmic Ca2+(37). CD40 ligation caused a rapid PLCgamma1 phosphorylation at Tyr783, a marker of PLCgamma1 activation (Fig. 5None). ATP release was impaired when Muller cells were treated with the PLC inhibitor U73122 but not when incubated with the inactive analog U73343 (Fig. 5None). Thus, CD40 ligation phosphorylates PLCgamma1 and appears to cause PLCgamma1-dependent ATP release in Muller cells. CD40 ligation in Muller cells causes Tyr783 phosphorylation (p) of PLCgamma1 and PLC-dependent secretion of ATP. A: CD40+Muller cells were incubated with or without BAPTA-AM, followed by stimulation with CD154 and measurement of extracellular ATP. Concentrations of extracellular ATP at time 0 and at 15 min of incubation are shown. B: CD40+human Muller cells were incubated with CD154. Expression of p-Tyr783 PLCgamma1 and total PLCgamma1 were assessed by immunoblot. The bars represent quantification of relative p-Tyr783 PLCgamma1 from three different experiments. C: CD40+Muller cells were incubated with U73122 or U73343, followed by stimulation with CD154 and measurement of extracellular ATP. Concentrations of extracellular ATP at time 0 and at 15 min of incubation are shown. Results are presented as mean +/- SEM (n= 3). **P less than 0.01, ***P less than 0.001 by Studentttest. We examined P2X7receptor expression to explore its in vivo role in the diabetic retina. P2X7receptor mRNA levels were enhanced in the retinas of diabetic Trg-CD40 mice (Fig. 6None). Immunohistochemistry indicated that microglia/macrophages from diabetic Trg-CD40 mice exhibited increased P2X7receptor expression (Fig. 6NoneandNone). Next, we examined the role of P2X7receptor on TNF-alpha and IL-1beta expression in diabetic mice and also examined ICAM-1 and NOS2 because retinal ICAM-1 upregulation in diabetes is TNF-alpha dependent (38) and TNF-alpha and IL-1beta promote NOS2 expression (39). Compared with B6 mice, diabetic P2X7-/-mice exhibited impaired upregulation of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, ICAM-1, and NOS2 (Fig. 6None). We treated diabetic Trg-CD40 mice with the P2X7receptor inhibitor Brilliant Blue G (BBG). BBG did not affect blood glucose or HbA1clevels (data not shown) but did diminish diabetes-induced TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, ICAM-1, and NOS2 upregulation (Fig. 6None). Together, the presence of CD40 in Muller cells from diabetic mice drives upregulation of retinal TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, ICAM-1, and NOS2 through a P2X7receptor-dependent mechanism. Diabetic transgenic mice that express CD40 in retinal Muller cells upregulate P2X7receptor in microglia/macrophages, and administration of the P2X7receptor inhibitor BBG impairs upregulation of retinal mRNA levels of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta. A: At 2 months of diabetes, retinas from diabetic (DM) and nondiabetic (ND) Trg-Ctr and Trg-CD40 mice were collected and used for mRNA extraction. mRNA levels of P2X7receptor were assessed by real-time quantitative PCR using 18S rRNA as the internal control. One nondiabetic Trg-Ctr mouse was given an arbitrary value of 1, and data are expressed as the fold-increase compared with this animal. The horizontal bars represent the mean +/- SEM (n= 7-11 animals per group). BandC: Sections from diabetic and nondiabetic Trg-CD40 mice were incubated with anti-P2X7receptor plus anti-Iba-1 antibodies. B: Sections were analyzed to determine the percentages of Iba-1+cells that stained brightly with anti-P2X7receptor anbitody. C: Images represent microglia/macrophages present in the inner plexiform layer (IPL) (n= 4 mice/group). Scale bar, 10 mum. D: At 2 months of diabetes, retinas from diabetic and nondiabetic B6 and P2X7-/-mice were collected and used to measure TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, ICAM-1, and NOS2 mRNA levels. One nondiabetic B6 mouse was given an arbitrary value of 1, and data are expressed as the fold-increase compared with this animal (n= 7-12 animals per group). E: Diabetic Trg-CD40 mice were treated with BBG or vehicle daily for 28 days beginning at 1 month of diabetes. Retinas from these animals and from diabetic and nondiabetic Trg-Ctr were collected and used to measure TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, ICAM-1, and NOS2 mRNA levels (n= 6-11 mice per group.) **P less than 0.01, ***P less than 0.001 by ANOVA. We report that expression of CD40 in Muller cells is sufficient for upregulation of inflammatory molecules in the diabetic retina and development of early diabetic retinopathy. In diabetes, CD40 on Muller cells drives upregulation of CCL2 in these cells; however, CD40 does not increase TNF-alpha and IL-1beta secretion by Muller cells. CD40 stimulation in Muller cells causes release of extracellular ATP, an effect that appears dependent on PLCgamma1. In turn, ATP released by CD40-activated Muller cells induces P2X7receptor-mediated secretion of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta by macrophages. These effects are relevant in vivo because TNF-alpha is upregulated in microglia/macrophages from diabetic mice that express CD40 in Muller cells and mice treated with BBG are protected from diabetes-induced upregulation of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta and also upregulation of ICAM-1 and NOS2. The role of P2X7is not only applicable to transgenic mice because diabetic P2X7-/-mice also exhibit diminished inflammatory molecule upregulation. These findings support a model of amplification of inflammation whereby CD40 engagement in Muller cells triggers an inflammatory response not only in these cells but also in bystander myeloid cells in a manner dependent on the ATP-P2X7receptor pathway. Extracellular ATP acts not only as a neurotransmitter but also as a messenger that triggers cytokine production by macrophages/microglia. We uncovered that CD40 induced the release of extracellular ATP. CD40 stimulation caused rapid Tyr783 phosphorylation of PLCgamma1 in Muller cells, and PLC inhibition prevented release of extracellular ATP after CD40 ligation. Indeed, PLC mediates ATP release (40). Work presented here strongly supports that purinergic signaling promotes proinflammatory cytokine expression in microglia/macrophages because1) administration of the P2X7inhibitor BBG impaired upregulation of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta in diabetic mice that express CD40 restricted to Muller cells, and2) diabetic P2X7-/-mice were protected from upregulation of these cytokines. These findings identified a mechanism that enables CD40 expressed in nonhematopoietic cells to induce macrophages/microglia to produce TNF-alpha and IL-1beta, cytokines pivotal in inflammation. This mechanism would circumvent the inability or poor capacity of CD40 to trigger secretion of these cytokines in nonhematopoietic cells. The level of P2X7receptor expression is functionally relevant because increased receptor expression is sufficient to cause microglia activation even in the absence of pathologic stimuli (41). Thus, the importance of the P2X7receptor in diabetic retinopathy is supported not only by the studies performed in P2X7-/-mice and in mice treated with BBG but also by the upregulation of the P2X7receptor noted in retinal microglia/macrophages. Moreover, P2X7receptor upregulation also occurs in diabetic B6 mice (J.-A.C.P., C.S.S., unpublished data). P2X7receptor is key for IL-1beta and TNF-alpha secretion by microglia/macrophages (42-45). Both cytokines contribute to diabetes-induced degeneration of retinal capillaries (5,6). The observation that the concentration of Bz-ATP (100-300 mumol/L) that induced IL-1beta and TNF-alpha production in monocytic cells appeared to be higher than the ATP concentration detected in ATP assays does not detract from the role of purinergic signaling in IL-1beta and TNF-alpha upregulation. The assay based on firefly luciferase underestimates ATP concentrations in the intercellular space. Assays based on targeting luciferase to the surface of intact cells revealed higher concentrations of ATP at the cell surface (100-200 mumol/L) (46). In addition, P2X7receptor upregulation in retinal microglia/macrophages may increase their sensitivity to ATP (47). Serum CD154 levels are elevated in diabetic mice, and soluble CD154 is biologically active (48). Thus, these results together with the prior demonstration of increased CD40 expression in retinal cells indicate that the CD40-CD154 pathway is likely activated in diabetes. Of relevance, plasma CD15 is increased in patients with diabetic retinopathy (49). Retinal CD154 levels are also likely increased because microthrombosis occurs in diabetic retinopathy and activated platelets express CD154 (50). Differences in soluble CD154 concentrations may contribute to the susceptibility to experimental diabetic retinopathy. However, we have not detected differences in serum CD154 concentrations between diabetic B6 and P2X7-/-mice, it is unlikely that CD40 expression in Muller cells affects circulating CD154, and CD40 upregulation is sufficient to markedly increase proinflammatory responses upon CD40 ligation. Although we did not detect CD40 expression in cells other than Muller glia, we cannot rule out that potential ectopic CD40 expression could contribute to the results observed. Finally, although these studies revealed the importance of CD40 in Muller cells for the pathogenesis of experimental diabetic retinopathy, CD40 signaling at the level of microglia/macrophages and/or endothelial cells likely also participates in the development of this disease. In summary, this study uncovered the pivotal role CD40 expressed in a nonhematopoietic compartment and the purinergic-mediated recruitment of proinflammatory responses in microglia/macrophages in the development of inflammatory responses. These findings may also be relevant to other diseases driven by CD40, including inflammatory bowel disease, atherosclerosis, and lupus nephritis. CD40 expressed in nonhematopoietic cells in intestine, blood vessels, and kidney may trigger the release of extracellular ATP and engagement of purinergic receptors present in infiltrating myeloid cells. Finally, these results may have therapeutic implications. Inhibition of CD40 can lead to a therapeutic approach against inflammatory disorders. Signaling pathways downstream of CD40 have different relative roles in inducing proinflammatory responses in hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells (11). Targeting a signaling pathway in nonhematopoietic cells may inhibit proinflammatory responses in these cells and in neighboring myeloid cells.
