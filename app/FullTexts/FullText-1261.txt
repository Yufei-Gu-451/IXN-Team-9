Genome-wide association studies have emphasized a key role of beta-cell function in type 2 diabetes (T2D) (1-3). The identity and function of the causal genes in these susceptibility loci remain, however, largely unknown. One such locus is positioned in theHHEX/IDEgene region (2-4), which in humans is associated with lower 30-min oral glucose-stimulated insulin levels (5,6). TheIdegene encodes a multifunctional protein implicated in a diverse set of processes, including development, cell growth and differentiation, proteasome activity, steroid-mediated signaling, and protein degradation (7). An important protective cellular function for IDE is to, via degradation or the formation of stable, irreversible complexes, limit intracellular levels of aggregate prone, amyloidogenic proteins and peptides, thereby preventing formation of toxic oligomers (7,8). Ideknockout (KO) mice have been reported to be glucose intolerant and hyperinsulinemic, which was suggested to be the result of reduced insulin degradation and peripheral insulin resistance (9,10). In contrast, Miller et al. (11) reported that blood glucose and insulin levels were normal in fasted-refedIdeKO mice. Here, we have assessed beta-cell function in mice lacking theIdegene. We show that insulin secretion is impaired and that islet autophagic flux and microtubule content are reduced inIdeKO mice. We also find that IDE can form stable complexes with alpha-synuclein and that levels of alpha-synuclein are increased inIdeKO islets. Moreover, we find that decreased IDE levels are associated with increased levels of alpha-synuclein in human T2D islets and that increased expression of alpha-synuclein in beta-cells of normal mice impairs glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) and autophagic flux. Thus, our data suggest thatIDEis a T2D risk gene, causing decreased GSIS and reduced autophagy via impaired suppression of alpha-synuclein levels in beta-cells. These findings suggest that increasing IDE activity and/or expression may represent a therapeutic strategy for treatment of human T2D. The animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Umea University and conducted in accordance with Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. TheIdeHz mice (C57BL/6albino:129SvEvBrd mixed background) were generated by Lexicon Genetics (12) and bred to generateIdewild-type (WT) and KO mice, which were then bred independently as previously described (9). TheSncaKO mice were obtained from the Jackson laboratory (stock 003692). TheRip/Sncatransgenic construct was generated by cloning a 546-bp, PCR-generated, full-length mouseSncacDNA fragment (primers used: 5'-ctagcccgggatcggagttcttcagaagcctagg-3' and 5'-ctagcccgggaactgagcacttgtacgccat-3') behind theRip2-hsp68hybrid promoter (subcloned from Addgene DM#265). Transgenic mice were generated at the Umea transgene core facility (Umea University). Glucose tolerance, insulin secretion, and insulin tolerance tests are detailed in theSupplementary Experimental Procedures. Total pancreatic insulin, proinsulin, and islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP)/amylin from 20-week-old mice were measured using a sensitive rat insulin radioimmunoassay (Linco), rat/mouse proinsulin ELISA kit (Mercodia), and rat/mouse amylin enzyme immunosorbent assay kit (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals), respectively. Immunohistochemical staining, quantification of mRNA expression levels, and cell counting were performed essentially as previously described (13,14) and as in theSupplementary Experimental Procedures. The primary and secondary antibodies used for immunohistochemistry and oligonucleotide sequences used for real-time RT-PCR are listed inSupplementary Tables 1 and 2. For islet culture experiments, islets were isolated by collagenase perfusion and recovered and equilibrated as previously described (14). In vitro analyses on isolated islets are detailed in theSupplementary Experimental Procedures. Western blot (WB) analyses of isolated mouse and human islets are detailed in theSupplementary Experimental Procedures. Aggregation and degradation assays were performed using recombinant rat-IDE (Calbiochem), human alpha-synuclein (Prospec), and human insulin (Novo Nordisk) as described in theSupplementary Experimental Procedures. Human islet studies were approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the Karolinska Institute. Human islets were isolated from brain-dead, heart-beating, T2D (n= 4) and nondiabetic multiorgan donors (n= 4) as previously described (15). All donors were in the age range of 48-72 years. The donors with diabetes were on treatment with metformin or insulin. The use of pancreata for scientific purpose was approved in all cases. Quantification of WB experiments was performed using Image-J software, and all the statistical analyses were performed by heteroscedastic two-tailed Studentttest. We considered a value ofP less than 0.05 to be statistically significant. To assess the role ofIdein beta-cells, we determined GSIS inIde-null mutant mice, denotedIdeKO, andIdeWT mice. First-phase insulin secretion was modestly reduced and second-phase insulin secretion was severely blunted inIdeKO mice (Fig. 1None). Consequently,IdeKO mice were hyperglycemic (nonfasted glucose levels = 9.9 +/- 0.3 mmol/L inIdeWT mice and 12.7 +/- 0.8 mmol/L inIdeKO mice,P= 0.004) and glucose intolerant (Fig. 1None). IDE levels are decreased in liver and brain ofIdeHz mice (11), and we found a ?30% decrease in IDE levels inIdeHz islets (Fig. 1NoneandNone). In addition,IdeHz mice showed blunted insulin secretion (Fig. 1None) and were glucose intolerant (Fig. 1None), providing evidence that theIdegene is haploinsufficient. IdeKO mice were not, however, hyperinsulinemic (fasted insulin = 0.39 +/- 0.06 ng/mL inIdeWT mice and 0.49 +/- 0.10 ng/mL inIdeKO mice,P= 0.40) and responded to exogenous insulin by reducing glucose levels at a rate identical to that ofIdeWT mice (Supplementary Fig. 1NoneandNone). Impaired insulin secretion and glucose intolerance inIdeKO mice. Insulin (A) and glucose (B) levels during GTT performed on 7-8-week-oldIdeKO (n= 8) andIdeWT (n= 8) mice.

Data are presented as mean +/- SEM. *P less than 0.05; **P less than 0.01; ***P less than 0.001 (Studentttest). GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. To further explore the role forIdein beta-cell function and to mimic conditions linked to the development of overt diabetes in humans, i.e., insulin resistance, we next analyzed high-fat diet (HFD)-treated and oldIdeWT and KO mice. Predictably,IdeWT mice developed insulin resistance (Supplementary Fig. 1NoneandNone) and glucose intolerance (Fig. 1NoneandNone) on HFD and with age, but responded to the developed insulin resistance by enhancing insulin secretion (Fig. 1NoneandNone). IdeKO mice also developed insulin resistance (Supplementary Fig. 1NoneandNone) on the HFD and with age, but the insulin secretion defect became further pronounced with significantly impaired first- and second-phase insulin secretion (Fig. 1NoneandNone), manifested as a further deterioration of glucose tolerance where glucose levels actually exceeded the detection limit of the gluconometer, i.e., 33.3 mmol/L, for several of the HFD mice, which therefore had to be counted as 33.3 mmol/L (Fig. 1NoneandNone). Thus, beta-cells ofIdeKO mice fail to adequately adapt to two of the major triggers of insulin resistance and T2D in humans: obesity and ageing. These findings provide evidence for a role forIdein ensuring GSIS and are consistent with the association of theHHEX/IDEsusceptibility allele to decreased insulin secretion in humans (5,6,16). To examine the underlying cause for the observed insulin secretion defect, we analyzed islet cell number and organization as well as the patterns of expression of the islet hormones insulin, glucagon, somatostatin, and pancreatic polypeptide, glucose transporter type 2 (Glut2), and the transcription factors Ipf1/Pdx1 and Isl1, all of which were normal (Fig. 2None). qRT-PCR analyses revealed that the expression of key beta-cell and endocrine transcription factors such asIsl1, Ipf1/Pdx1, Nkx6.1, NeuroD, MafA, andHhex, as well as that of the kinesin motor proteinKif11, which is also part of theHHEX/IDElocus (5), was similar in islets ofIdeWT andIdeKO mice (Supplementary Fig. 2None). IdeKO mice showed a significant increase in pancreatic insulin (?85%) (Fig. 2None) and IAPP (?30%) (Fig. 2None) content, and confocal microscopy analyses provided evidence of increased density of insulin vesicles (Supplementary Fig. 2None). No significant change in glucagon content was observed (data not shown), and the proinsulin/insulin ratio was normal inIdeKO islets (Supplementary Fig. 2None). Thus, the reduced GSIS observed inIdeKO mice does not appear to result from impaired beta-cell differentiation, a decreased amount of beta-cells, or insufficient insulin content. Increased pancreatic insulin and IAPP content inIdeKO mice.

GandH: Immunoblot (G) and quantification (H) analyses of LC3-II expression in nonstarved and starvedIdeKO (n= 6 mice) andIdeWT (n= 6 mice) islets, in the absence or presence of chloroquine (s + chl). Data are presented as mean +/- SEM. *P less than 0.05; **P less than 0.01; ***P less than 0.001 (Studentttest). GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Under conditions involving reduced insulin secretion, pancreatic insulin content homeostasis is maintained via induction of autophagy (17,18). The increased insulin and IAPP content ofIdeKO beta-cells suggested that autophagy-mediated maintenance of pancreatic insulin content homeostasis may be reduced. In agreement with this notion, the autophagic marker LC3, the autophagic substrate p62, and polyubiquitinated proteins were accumulated in islets of fasted and fedIdeKO mice as compared with those ofIdeWT mice (Fig. 2None,Supplementary Fig. 2None, and data not shown). Moreover, LC3 turnover assays (19) showed that, in contrast toIdeWT islets, the lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine failed to increase LC3-II levels in starvedIdeKO islets, and the rate of autophagic flux was reduced by 28% inIdeKO islets (Fig. 2NoneandNone). The expression of key autophagy genes such asAtg5, Atg6/Beclin, Atg7, andAtg8/LC3was normal in beta-cells ofIdeKO mice (Supplementary Fig. 2None), arguing against a reduced expression of these genes as the underlying cause for the beta-cell autophagy defect. Together, these findings indicate that the increased pancreatic insulin and IAPP content ofIdeKO mice, at least in part, is the consequence of reduced autophagic flux in beta-cells ofIdeKO mice. To elucidate at what levelIdeascertains insulin secretion, we next analyzed the effect of secretagogues on insulin secretion inIdeKO andIdeWT mice. Glibenclamide, arginine, and carbachol stimulated insulin secretion to the same extent inIdeKO andIdeWT mice (Fig. 3None). These secretagogues act, however, primarily by stimulating exocytosis of insulin from the releasable pool of granules (20-22), suggesting that docking, priming, and triggering of exocytosis of granules are unimpaired inIdeKO mice. IdeKO mice fail to replenish the readily releasable pool of insulin granules. Insulin secretion after intraperitoneal injection of glibenclamide (12-week-oldIdeKO [n= 7] andIdeWT [n= 3]) (A), arginine (13-17-week-oldIdeKO [n= 11] andIdeWT [n= 14]) (B), and carbachol (14-18-week-oldIdeKO [n= 8] andIdeWT [n= 9]) (C). D: Insulin secretion after consecutive, dual arginine injections administered at time 0 and 10 min, indicated by arrows in 16-week-oldIdeKO (n= 6) andIdeWT (n= 4) mice. E: Insulin secretion from four single, size-matched islets incubated in the presence of 150 mumol/L diazoxide and 30 mmol/L K+at either 16.8 (diamonds) or 2.8 mmol/L (triangles) glucose. Significance is indicated for comparison of datasets between 16.8 and 2.8 mmol/L glucose forIdeWT (*) andIdeKO ( degrees ), respectively. Islets were isolated from 12-15-week-old Ide KO (n= 5) and Ide WT (n= 4) mice. Data are presented as mean +/- SEM. *P less than 0.05; **P less than 0.01; ***/ degrees degrees degrees P less than 0.001 (Studentttest). The expression levels of genes involved in glucose uptake, glucose metabolism, and membrane depolarization, i.e.,Glut2, glucokinase (GK), SUR1, andKir6.2, were similar between control andIdeKO mice (Supplementary Fig. 3None). Control andIdeKO islets also showed a similar increase in ATP/ADP ratio in response to glucose (Supplementary Fig. 3None), providing evidence that glucose uptake and metabolism are unaffected in beta-cells ofIdeKO mice. The expression of genes involved in exocytosis, such asRab3c, Rab27a, Vamp2,Snap25, Stx1a, Stx4, Syt7, andSyt9, was indistinguishable betweenIdeWT andIdeKO mice, and there was a nonsignificant tendency to decreased expression ofRab3band increased expression ofRab3ain islets ofIdeKO mice (Supplementary Fig. 3NoneandNone). Thus, expression of key components of the insulin exocytosis machinery is largely unimpaired in islets ofIdeKO mice. To further probe howIderegulates second-phase insulin secretion, we next performed dual arginine stimulation of insulin secretion in vivo with a 10-min interval (23). The first arginine stimulus will empty the releasable pool of granules, and hence the second arginine stimulus will challenge the ability to replenish this pool (23). The insulin secretion response to the first arginine injection was similar inIdeWT andIdeKO mice, whereas insulin secretion in response to the second arginine stimulus was severely blunted inIdeKO mice (Fig. 3None). Additionally, in vitro perifusion of isolated islets showed that insulin secretion in response to high (16.8 mmol/L) glucose levels was reduced inIdeKO islets (Supplementary Fig. 3None). After an intermittent 3-min period of low (2.8 mmol/L) glucose levels, sequential addition of high glucose levels together with glibenclamide was unable to correct the insulin secretion defect inIdeKO islets (Supplementary Fig. 3None). These findings indicate that recruitment of granules from the reserve pool and/or priming of granules in the releasable pool are decreased inIdeKO mice. The glucose-amplifying pathway contributes to the second phase of insulin secretion by accelerating the priming process of granules (24-26). To investigate the glucose amplifying pathway inIdeKO mice, islets were depolarized by high K+in the presence of the KATPchannel activator diazoxide. Under these conditions, high glucose (16.8 mmol/L) concentrations generated a robust increase in insulin secretion from bothIdeWT andIdeKO islets, although the relative amount of insulin secreted fromIdeKO islets was reduced (Fig. 3None). Thus,IdeKO islets respond to the amplifying pathway of insulin secretion by glucose, indicating that priming of granules is largely unaffected inIdeKO beta-cells. The perturbation of insulin granule recruitment as well as autophagy in beta-cells ofIdeKO mice urged us to look for a potential common denominator that might explain these phenotypes. The cytoskeleton and, in particular, microtubules are implicated in efficient insulin granule transport (27), autophagosome formation, transport, and fusion with lysosomes (28,29). Total tubulin was reduced by ?27% in starvedIdeKO islets compared withIdeWT islets (Fig. 4NoneandNone), and the amount of polymerized tubulin, i.e., microtubules, in starvedIdeKO islets was ?57% of that observed inIdeWT islets (Fig. 4NoneandNone). Glucose stimulation increases the amount of polymerized tubulin (30), and although both control andIdeKO islets increased their levels of polymerized tubulin upon glucose stimulation, total and polymerized tubulin content were still reduced, by ?30%, in glucose-stimulatedIdeKO islets compared withIdeWT islets (Fig. 4NoneandNone). Glucose stimulation ensures mobilization and trafficking of granules also by inducing the reorganization of F-actin (27). Consequently, F-actin-depolymerizing agents, such as latrunculin B (Supplementary Fig. 4NoneandNone), have been shown to enhance GSIS (27). Phalloidin staining ofIdeWT andIdeKO islets did not, however, reveal any apparent difference in actin organization (Supplementary Fig. 4None), and, in contrast toIdeWT islets,IdeKO islets failed to increase insulin secretion in response to latrunculin B (Fig. 4None). These data indicate that the insulin secretion defect ofIdeKO beta-cells is upstream of F-actin reorganization, suggesting that the insulin secretion defect observed inIdeKO mice, at least in part, is a consequence of reduced, microtubule-dependent recruitment of granules. Microtubule levels are reduced inIdeKO islets.

To further assess how loss of IDE activity impairs insulin secretion, autophagy, and tubulin polymerization, we looked for a candidate IDE substrate that would negatively affect these processes. alpha-Synuclein, encoded bySnca,is an amyloidogenic protein negatively correlated with secretion, autophagy, microtubule polymerization, and trafficking (31-34). Moreover, alpha-synuclein contains the four-amino acid GAXX amyloidogenic region, where X corresponds to amino acids with an aliphatic side chain, which is also present in the IDE substrates amyloidbeta and IAPP (35). Analyses of alpha-synuclein protein levels revealed an ?30-40% increase of alpha-synuclein monomers inIdeKO islets compared withIdeWT islets and an intermediate (?15%) increase of alpha-synuclein inIdeHz islets (Fig. 5None). Increased levels of alpha-synuclein were also observed by immunohistochemistry in beta-cells ofIdeKO mice (Fig. 5None). These findings suggest thatIde,directly or indirectly, regulates alpha-synuclein levels in beta-cells. To further evaluate the impact of increased alpha-synuclein levels on insulin secretion and autophagic flux, we generatedRip/Sncatransgenic mice overexpressing alpha-synuclein in beta-cells. Rip/Sncamice had blunted GSIS and reduced glucose tolerance (Fig. 5None), decreased autophagic flux (?25%) (Fig. 5None), and decreased microtubules (?30-40%) (Supplementary Fig. 5NoneandNone) but normal IDE levels, beta-cell numbers, and beta-cell turnover (Supplementary Fig. 5Noneand data not shown). Thus, increased levels of alpha-synuclein in beta-cells negatively affect insulin secretion, autophagic flux, and microtubule content. alpha-Synuclein levels are increased inIde KOislets.

To explore whether the increased levels of alpha-synuclein in beta-cells ofIdeKO mice reflect a role for IDE in alpha-synuclein degradation, recombinant alpha-synuclein was incubated with recombinant IDE. Although IDE efficiently degraded insulin already within 1 h of incubation, IDE was not capable of degrading alpha-synuclein even if incubated for 48 h (Fig. 5Noneand data not shown). IDE has also, however, been suggested to function as a "dead-end chaperone" that neutralizes the aggregation of amyloidogenic proteins by forming irreversible, SDS-resistant complexes with monomeric forms of the protein (8). Incubation of alpha-synuclein alone resulted in the formation of high-molecular-weight complexes corresponding to alpha-synuclein pentamers and decamers already after 30 min (Fig. 5NoneandSupplementary Fig. 5None). Incubation of alpha-synuclein with IDE not only reduced the formation of these oligomeric complexes but also generated, in a time- and dose-dependent manner, an SDS-resistant, ?130-kDa complex that was recognized by alpha-synuclein antibodies (Fig. 5NoneandNoneandSupplementary Fig. 5None). The ?130-kDa complex corresponds to the combined molecular weight of IDE (?110 kDa) and alpha-synuclein (?17 kDa on an SDS-PAGE) and was recognized also by IDE antibody (Supplementary Fig. 5None). Moreover, IDE antibodies dose-dependently competed with the formation of the ?130-kDa IDE/alpha-synuclein complex (Supplementary Fig. 5None). IDE was not, however, capable of affecting preformed high-molecular-weight alpha-synuclein oligomers, although the ?130-kDa complex was still generated (Supplementary Fig. 5None). These findings indicate that IDE, by complexing with alpha-synuclein monomers, reduces the formation of alpha-synuclein oligomers. We next assessed IDE and alpha-synuclein protein levels in islets isolated from T2D patients and nondiabetic controls. IDE levels were decreased (by ?40%) in human T2D islets compared with nondiabetic controls (Fig. 5None). alpha-Synuclein monomeric levels were very low and in some cases barely detectable in islets from nondiabetic controls (Fig. 5None). Levels of alpha-synuclein monomers were, however, increased (by ?100%) in islets from T2D patients (Fig. 5None). In addition, an ?50-60-kD protein, or protein complex, recognized by alpha-synuclein antibodies was increased (by ?130%) in T2D islets compared with nondiabetic islets (Fig. 5None). Taken together, these findings provide evidence that levels of alpha-synuclein are inversely correlated with IDE levels in islets ofIde-deficient mice and human T2D patients. To functionally assess whether the increase in levels of alpha-synuclein alone accounts for the impaired beta-cell function ofIde-deficient mice, we bred theSncaKO allele onto theIdeKO background. Glucose tolerance tests (GTTs) showed that lack ofSncanot only failed to rescue the impaired beta-cell function ofIdemutant mice but insulin secretion was further blunted inIdeKO;SncaKO double mutant mice as compared withIdeKO mice (Fig. 6NoneandNone). These data imply a role forSncain GSIS, and GTTs revealed thatSncaKO mice were glucose intolerant and had a severely impaired GSIS (Fig. 6NoneandNone). Similarly, autophagic flux was reduced in islets ofSncaKO mice (Fig. 6None) and worsened inIde;Sncadouble KO islets as compared withIdeKO islets (Fig. 6None). Together these data not only show that loss ofSncainIdeKO mutant mice fails to rescue both the GSIS and autophagic flux phenotype in these mice but also suggest thatSnca, in a dose-dependent manner, is required for normal GSIS and glucose tolerance as well as beta-cell autophagy. alpha-Synuclein mutant (SncaKO) mice show decreased GSIS and reduced autophagy flux in islets. A-D: Insulin (AandC) and glucose (BandD) levels during GTT performed on 7-9-week-oldIdeWT,IdeKO,SncaKO;IdeKO (AandB),SncaWT, andSncaKO mice (CandD) (n= 8-15 per genotype).

Data are presented as mean +/- SEM. *P less than 0.05; **P less than 0.01; ***P less than 0.001 (Studentttest). GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Our study shows thatIdecontrols beta-cell function; mice lacking a functionalIdegene are hyperglycemic, glucose intolerant, and insulin secretion deficient due to reduced replenishment of the releasable pool of insulin granules. Farris et al. (9) and Abdul-Hay et al. (10) found thatIdeKO mice were glucose intolerant, had increased fasting insulin levels, and showed evidence of insulin resistance and impaired insulin degradation, whereas Miller et al. (11) reported thatIdeKO mice had normal glucose and insulin levels 4 h after refeeding of overnight-fasted mice. We do not find fasting insulin levels to be significantly elevated inIdeKO mice, nor do we find evidence of insulin resistance. Whether the differences in phenotype reflect differences in genetic background and/or methodologies used is unclear but underscores the still unresolved question regarding the role for IDE in insulin degradation (36). Nonetheless, we do find thatIdeKO mice have significantly impaired GSIS, which was not explored in any of the other studies (9-11). We also find that theIdegene is haploinsufficient and that IDE levels are inversely correlated with alpha-synuclein levels in mouse and human islets. Moreover, we show that increased levels of alpha-synuclein in beta-cells impair GSIS and autophagy in vivo, and that IDE can form stable complexes with alpha-synuclein. These findings are1) consistent with the decreased insulin secretion associated with theHHEX/IDET2D locus in humans (5,6,16),2) identifyIdeas a key beta-cell gene in vivo, thus implicatingIDEas a potential T2D susceptibility allele, and3) suggest a mechanism for this risk allele in insulin secretion and diabetes in humans. These findings do not, however, rule out other role(s) forIdein beta-cells. Likewise, although our in vitro analyses are supportive of a cell-autonomous role forIdein beta-cells, theIdeKO mice analyzed in this study are global KOs; thus, we cannot exclude that the beta-cell defect displayed by these mutants, at least in part, may be influenced byIde-related deficiencies in other cells and tissues. Our findings that GSIS is reduced in mice overexpressing alpha-synuclein in beta-cells are supportive of previous data showing that overexpression of alpha-synuclein in an insulinoma cell line reduces basal, and to a lesser extent glucose-stimulated, insulin secretion (31). Together, these findings suggest that alpha-synuclein suppresses insulin secretion. Increased alpha-synuclein levels have been shown to negatively influence microtubule polymerization and trafficking (33,34), and a role for microtubules is implicated both in GSIS (27) and autophagy (28,29). Thus, the decreased microtubule content in bothIdeandRip/Sncaislets suggests that the reduced GSIS and autophagy observed in these mice, at least in part, may result from negative effects of alpha-synuclein on microtubule polymerization and function. The exact role, if any, for microtubules in GSIS is however unclear; numerous studies implicate a role for microtubules in GSIS, in particular for the recruitment of granules for sustained insulin secretion (reviewed in27), whereas others provide evidence against a role for microtubules in GSIS (26). alpha-Synuclein has been shown to interact with Kir6.2 at insulin granules (31) and overexpression of alpha-synuclein in vitro, possibly by negatively affecting Rab1a function, impairs growth hormone secretion and autophagy in mammalian cells (32), providing additional, microtubule-independent, mechanistic implications of increased levels of alpha-synuclein (Fig. 7). Model for the role of IDE in beta-cell function. IDE forms irreversible complexes with alpha-synuclein monomers. Loss ofIdein beta-cells leads to increased levels of free alpha-synuclein monomers that, via subsequent formation of oligomers, impair insulin secretion and autophagy, possibly in part by attenuation of the microtubule network. Surprisingly, our analyses ofSncaKO andIdeKO;SncaKO double mutant mice are supportive of a positive role for alpha-synuclein in beta-cells;SncaKO mice showed severely reduced GSIS and attenuated autophagic flux in islets, and lack ofSncaon anIdeKO background resulted in a further deterioration of GSIS and autophagy. In contrast, previous studies of in vitro glucose stimulation of alpha-synuclein-deficient islets showed evidence of an increased insulin secretion rate at low and medium, but not high, glucose levels (31). Whether the discrepancy between these findings reflects the in vitro versus in vivo experimental design is unclear but underscores the need for additional studies to address the mechanism by whichSncaregulates insulin secretion. Notably, the exact physiological function of alpha-synuclein remains largely unknown but a role for alpha-synuclein in diverse processes like SNARE complex formation and mitochondrial calcium homeostasis has been suggested as has the idea that the toxic activities of alpha-synuclein may in fact reflect its normal function (37,38). IDE has been shown to form stable, irreversible complexes with amyloidogenic proteins such as amyloidbeta (8), and our studies provide evidence that alpha-synuclein oligomerization is antagonized by this proposed "dead-end chaperone" activity of IDE in beta-cells (Fig. 7). Human IAPP is also an IDE substrate, and in contrast to rodent IAPP, human IAPP can develop toxic oligomers and amyloid deposits, which are commonly observed in beta-cells of T2D patients (39,40). In humans, reduced IDE expression and/or activity may thus lead to increased levels of IAPP oligomers and, with time, the formation of IAPP amyloid deposits and beta-cell destruction. Autophagy is important for selective degradation of accumulated and aggregated proteins, sometimes referred to as aggrephagy (41). Thus, independent of IDE expression or activity, conditions leading to reduced autophagy in beta-cells likely lead to increased intracellular levels of not only alpha-synuclein but also IAPP oligomers and an enhanced likelihood of IAPP aggregation and consequently amyloid formation in human beta-cells. T2D is associated with both age and obesity, and IDE activity has been shown to decline with age (42) and be inhibited by long-chain free fatty acids (43). Moreover, autophagy is inhibited by insulin, and conditions leading to increased insulin levels, e.g., ageing and obesity, are associated with impaired autophagy (44). Hence, increasing age and obesity likely result in reduced IDE activity as well as autophagy and consequently decreased turnover and/or neutralization of amyloidogenic proteins such as alpha-synuclein and IAPP, which in turn may lead to beta-cell degeneration. Thus, stimulation of IDE expression or activity could represent a valuable therapeutic strategy for the prevention and/or restoration of beta-cell function in T2D patients.
