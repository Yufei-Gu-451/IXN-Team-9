Most applications of high-temperature superconductors involve the use of silver. In thin-film devices, it serves as an electrical contact with acceptably low contact resistance, on the order of 10-8Omega.cm2. In large-scale devices the contact application is also important; the contact resistance can be higher, but the contact area is large. In conductor applications silver also provides (1) containment for the precursor powder mix during mechanical processing; (2) containment for the powder while allowing passage of oxygen during heat treatment to form the superconducting structure; (3) stabilization of the conductor in operation by providing an alternate current path and a thermal path to the coolant; (4) providing mechanical strength to the finished conductor; and (5) providing internal strain relief for the brittle superconductor when mixed as part of the powder. In low-temperature superconductors, most of these roles are carried out by copper. Silver, however, is required in high-temperature superconductors because of its unique ability to allow passage of diffusing oxygen. The low-temperature properties of silver also make it an attractive choice in applications that are not directly related to superconductivity. These properties are its high thermal and electrical conductivities, diamagnetism, high reflectance, and low emittance. Over the past two decades, we have produced two versions [1,2] of a wall chart presenting the cryogenic properties of copper. This chart has been popular with the low-temperature superconductor community. With the advent of high-temperature superconductors, we decided that a similar wall chart of cryogenic properties of silver would be valuable. This new chart,Cryogenic Properties of Silver, became available for distribution in January 1994 [3]. Limitations on the size of the chart did not allow us to present all the cryogenic-property data which were found in our review of the literature. Furthermore, the chart provided very little room for presentation of tabular data or commentary. Providing that additional information is the purpose of this paper. Here we present figures and tables of the electrical, magnetic, mechanical, optical, thermal, and thermodynamic properties of pure silver, culled from more than 200 documents covering a period of over 60 years. While we concentrated on these properties, we have also included information in areas such as metal physics and effects of irradiation by high-energy particles on resistivity. In general, we treated only pure silver. However, one paper on coin silver was included because this alloy is commonly available and might be of use at cryogenic temperatures. Also, mention is made (see Sec. 3.1, Ref. [137]) of a new material, a dispersion-hardened silver alloy which can provide additional strength and resistance to thermal shock, while maintaining acceptable thermal and electrical properties. The door to the properties of other alloys of silver was not cracked further open. This work is not a complete survey of all the literature available on silver. While we made a strong effort to identify those papers of most use to workers interested in the cryogenic applications of silver, resources did not permit an exhaustive search of all the current literature. We believe that we located most, if not all, of the important sources of available data. Each bibliographic reference to a paper has been annotated by a capsule summary of the content specifically related to cryogenic applications of silver. Before the reader uses any data for engineering design or other critical applications, the reader is strongly urged to consult the original reference(s) for complete details of the conditions of measurement. Some mention needs to be made regarding the techniques by which data were transferred from the graphs and plots in the original documents into the form presented here. Where tabular data were available there was no problem, and the plots were made directly. However, most of the documents provided data in graphical form, and often only as very small graphs and of quality less than that available now in the era of desktop publishing. In those cases, a combination of enlargement by photocopier, use of a graphics tablet, and commercial plotting software allowed extraction and smoothing of the data while maintaining the accuracy of the original plot. Because of the increased size of many of the plots, some curves show a minor lack of smoothness. All such variations lie within the accuracy of the data as plotted in the original publication. In the following descriptions of tables and figures, a bullet () at the beginning of a paragraph denotes a description corresponding to a table or figure used in the wall chart,Cryogenic Properties of Silver[3]. Those tables or figures were selected for inclusion in the chart because of widest appeal or interest. For each graph or table in this paper there is always a corresponding bibliographic entry in Sec. 3, similarly marked with a dagger () and index number. The additional documents in the bibliography, under the topics listed here, contain further information on these properties. The fundamental physical and chemical properties of silver are summarized inTable 1. It is fairly easy to find more than one secondary source for many of the data in the table, and there are usually small (within one or two percent) disagreements among the various values for a given property. Where multiple values were found, a representative (most frequently occurring) value was chosen for listing in this table. Conversion factors between SI units and other systems, such as traditional ("British") units are given inTables 2aand2b. Matthiessen's rule assumes that the total electrical resistivityrhoelis well approximated by a sum of two terms. The first is a temperature-dependent intrinsic termrhoint(T), which is zero at absolute zero. The second term is a residual termrho0due to the effect of impurities and crystal defects, and does not vanish at absolute zero. InFig. 1the total electrical resistivity of silver as a function of temperature is plotted for four different values ofRRR(residual resistance ratio; a measure of impurity content), and a value forrhointat 0 degrees C is given. For metals in electrical applications, values forRRRare a more sensitive measure of purity than total content of chemical impurities. Above 80 K the resistivity of dilute alloys of silver is independent of impurity content, whereas below 80 K the resistivity is sensitive to impurity content. At room temperature the variation of resistivity with temperature is nearly linear. Table 3lists the change in electrical resistivity per "atomic percent" (mole fraction) of alloying element for 20 different metallic elements in pure silver. The effect of alloying small amounts of impurities with silver is to increase its resistivity. The change, initially linear with very small increases in concentration, is nonlinear as larger amounts of alloying element are added. The transition point to nonlinear dependence on concentration is different for different impurities. Hence the values listed in the table should be used only as a guide, and then very cautiously. One can assume without large error that the effects of several impurities are additive in small quantities. Magnetoresistance, the dependence of electrical resistivity on applied magnetic field, is given inFig. 2as a Kohler plot. For many polycrystalline metals, data covering wide ranges of temperature and metallic purity reduce to a single curve for the transverse case (field normal to current), and data for many different metals will fall on the curve. This is known as Kohler's rule. However, it is frequently not obeyed, and the silver data in particular seem not to obey the rule. Regardless, application of relatively modest magnetic fields can cause large changes in resistance at low temperatures. The longitudinal magnetoresistance, measured with the field parallel to the current, saturates for most metals at a relatively low value, as seen here. In single-crystal specimens, the magnetoresistance is a strong function of crystal orientation, and measurements of magnetoresistance are used to determine the detailed topology of the Fermi surface. Figure 3plots the relative change in resistivity due to cold working (increasing the number of defects in the specimen; the reduction in the cross-sectional area of specimen accompanying the cold working is taken into account in computing the resistivity). This figure shows that the dependence on cold working varies somewhat with temperature. That is, Matthiessen's rule does not strictly apply. Cold working should affect only the number of geometrical defects such as vacancies and interstitials, which are independent of temperature (until annealing begins to occur, at temperatures well above room temperature); the ideal temperature-dependent intrinsic resistivityrhoint(T) due only to lattice vibrations should not be affected by cold working. Electrical resistance depends weakly on applied pressure. The relative resistanceR(P)R(P=0), normalized to unity at "zero pressure," is plotted inFig. 4. Both the relative resistance and the relative volume of silver, also normalized to unity at "zero pressure," are tabulated inTable 4. One assumes that "zero pressure" is, in practice, atmospheric pressure, about 100 kPa or 10-4GPa; the error in this assumption is minuscule. Figure 5plots the isochronal recovery of resistivity of silver wires after deformation under tension. After the deformation, carried out at -183 degrees C (90 K), the temperature of the wire was raised by a constant amount and held at that temperature for a fixed period of time. The holding time was the same ("isochronal") for all annealing temperatures. From the shape of the curve, the two values for energy of activation of recovery, 0.18 eV and 0.69 eV, were deduced. Another study of isochronal annealing at 77 K gave "resistivity differential curves of fractional isochronal annealing" after torsional deformation, for silver and silver alloys. Figure 6gives the plot for pure silver. The peaks in the curve at 110 K and 250 K are interpreted as major annealing stages. (We question whether the ordinate is correctly given as Delta(Deltarho/Deltarho0)/DeltaTin the original paper, becauserhooshould not change in the given experiment. The ordinate should rather be Delta(Deltarho/rho0)/DeltaT, the change in fractional recovery of resistivity with temperature.) The use of superconducting magnets in applications involving high-energy particle beams motivated the inclusion ofFig. 7. This shows the relative change in resistivity per unit electron flux, as a function of average energy of the bombarding electrons. The bombardment was performed at specimen temperatures of 20.4 K.Thermal conductivitylambdais the measure of steady-state conductive flow of heat. Figure 8gives the thermal conductivity of silver for various values ofRRR(residual resistance ratio, a measure of impurity content). The expression 1/lambda=Wth=Wi+W0is the thermal analog of Matthiessen's rule; hereWthis the total thermal resistance,Wiis the ideal temperature-dependent resistance, andW0is the resistance due to impurities. The Lorenz numberL=rhoel/(WthT), whererhoelis electrical resistivity andTis absolute temperature, is theoretically a constant for all metals at absolute zero. Theory predicts thatlambdashould vary linearly with temperature at very low temperatures (below the three conductivity peaks near 10 K). The slope immediately above the peak is observed empirically to vary approximately asT-2.3. This gives the slope at which the conductivity would continue to rise with decreasing temperature in the absence of any physical defects or chemical impurities (thermal resistance decreasing to zero at absolute zero). The conductivity is observed empirically to become independent of impurity content above about 70 K.Thermal conductivity can vary with magnetic field, due to the effect of the field on the conduction electrons. This magneto-thermal resistance is shown inFig. 9in the form of thermal resistanceW, normalized to the zero-field resistanceW0=W(B=0), as a function of magnetic inductionB. The four curves are for different values ofW0and specimen orientation (longitudinal or transverse to the thermal current); the temperatures of the measurement were also slightly different for each experiment. Thermal diffusivityais a measure of the transient flow of heat through a material. (The symbol a is chosen here for diffusivity to avoid confusion between diffusivity and thermal expansion, both of which are conventionally represented by the symbolalpha). The relationa=lambda/(CNone. rho) defines the thermal diffusivity in terms of the thermal conductivitylambda, the specific heatCNoneand the densityrho. Fig. 10shows the diffusivity as a function of temperature. The linear thermal expansion coefficient measures the one-dimensional expansion of a material with changing temperature. It is defined byalpha=(dL/dT)/L0=dln(L)/dT, whereL0is the length of the specimen at a reference temperature, conventionally taken to be 293 K (20 degrees C). For silver it varies with temperature as shown inFig. 11. Because alpha varies by several orders of magnitude between liquid-helium temperature and room temperature, the curve is given as a log-log plot. The volumetric expansion coefficient, gamma=dln(V)/dT, measures the three-dimensional variation of volume with temperature, and is well approximated by gamma =3alpha. The variation of densityrhowith temperature is given byrho(T)=m/V(T)=m/(V0(1+gamma(T)), wheremis the mass of the specimen. The areal, or two-dimensional, thermal expansion coefficient isbeta=dln(A)/dTand is well approximated bybeta=2alpha. The absolute thermoelectric powerS=dE/dTis a measure of the rate of change of absolute thermoelectric emfEwith temperature. An electrical circuit involving two junctions of silver (of thermoelectric powerSa) with another metal (of thermoelectric powerSb) will generate an output emf per degree equal toSa-Sbwhen the junctions are at different temperatures. Because of its strong dependence on temperature, it is given on a log-log plot inFig. 12. The Hall coefficient -RH(T) is plotted inFig. 13as a function of temperature for silver in a magnetic inductionB=1.5155 T. (Because electrons are the charge carriers in silver, the Hall coefficient for silver is negative; so -RHis plotted vertically upward). The low-field dependence with temperature of the relative Hall coefficientRH(T), normalized to its value at 77 K, is given inFig. 14. InFig. 15, the temperature dependence of the same normalized (relative) Hall coefficient is graphed for two different values of applied magnetic induction (solid lines:B=0.5145T; dashed lines:B=8.5 mT). For each value of magnetic field, the normalized coefficient is graphed for three different values ofRRR(residual resistance ratio, a measure of impurity content), values of 510, 3250, and 3550). Figure 16displays the relative Hall coefficients at 4.2 K, normalized to the value at 77 K, as a function of magnetic inductionBandRRRvalue. These are the same specimens (and sameRRRvalues) as inFig. 15. The relative Hall coefficients for the specimens havingRRR=3250 (specimen 1) and 3550 (specimen 2) show saturation at magnetic inductions above 0.2T, while that for the low-purity (specimen 3:RRR=510) did not saturate. The authors could offer no explanation for the occurrence of minima in theRHcurves for specimens 2 and 3 and the apparent absence of a minimum inRHfor specimen 1 (intermediate purity); possibly this specimen has a minimum atB=0 T.The anisotropy factor tauNP/tauBPis a measure of relaxation time tau on the "neck" (N) of the Fermi surface (FS) normalized by the relaxation time for the FS "belly" (B), for electron-phonon (P) scattering. Fig. 17plots the anisotropy factor for pure silver. Figure 18shows how normal spectral emissivity of silver at 295 K depends on (visible and infrared) wavelength. The absorptance of electromagnetic radiation from the near ultraviolet (220 nm) through the visible (400 nm to 700 nm), to the near infrared (5000 nm), is tabulated inTable 5and plotted inFig. 19. Values are given for freshly evaporated film, for bulk metal, and for a polished, chemically deposited surface. The latter two sets are probably more realistic for modeling the optical properties of silver-sheathed superconducting wire in practical applications. The angular reflectivity of silver, for visible light of wavelengthlambda=546 nm, is given inFig. 20as a function of angle of incidence. Table 6lists the real and imaginary components,nandk, of the complex optical index of refractionN=n-ik, along with the reflectanceR, for the visible and near infrared parts of the spectrum. The values are also plotted inFig. 21. Optical reflectance plus absorptance for a metal sum to unity. It follows that surface films of oil, grease or dust, compromising the cleanliness of the silver and increasing its optical absorptance, easily reduce its reflectance. From the temperature dependence of the linear thermal expansion coefficient alpha, plotted inFig. 11, the volumetric expansion coefficient can be calculated, and then the dependence of densityrhowith temperature. The results of this calculation is given inFig. 22; a value of 10.492 g/cm3(seeTable 1) was assumed for the value of density at 20 degrees C.For the low-temperature range (temperatures from 3 K to 30 K) the temperature dependence of specific heatCNoneis tabulated inTable 7. The low-temperature specific heat is graphed inFig. 23on a linear scale to show the high-temperature behavior, and inFig. 24on a log-log scale to emphasize the low-temperature behavior. Table 8gives the temperature dependence over the range of temperatures from 0 K to 300 K for specific heatCNone, entropyS, enthalpyH degrees None, Gibbs energyG degrees None, enthalpy function (H degrees None-H degrees 0)/T, and Gibbs energy function -(G degrees None-H degrees 0)/T. The enthalpy functionH degrees Noneis the enthalpy at 101 kPa (1 atm) and temperatureT, and similarly for the Gibbs energy. The reference functionH degrees 0is the enthalpy at 101 kPa and 0 K.NoneSpecific heat capacityCNoneand enthalpy,H degrees None-H degrees 0, are both plotted as functions of temperature inFig. 25for ease of comparison. The entropySand specific heatCNoneare both plotted inFig. 26for ease of comparison. Entropy is the integral over temperature of the specific heat function divided by temperature. Consequently, as the specific heat approaches a constant value at high temperatures (law of Dulong and Petit) the entropy tends to increase linearly with temperature. Enthalpy (H degrees None-H degrees 0) and Gibbs energy -(G degrees None-H degrees 0) are plotted together inFig. 27as functions of temperature for ease of comparison. The enthalpy function (H degrees None-H degrees 0)/Tand Gibbs energy function -(G degrees None-H degrees 0)/T are plotted inFig. 28as functions of temperature. These functions are sometimes useful to know because of the thermodynamic identity between Gibbs energyG, enthalpyHand entropyS:G-H= -TS. From this identity it follows that -(G-H)/T=S, and then -(G degrees None-H degrees 0)/T+(H degrees None-H degrees 0)/T=S(the superscripts " degrees " denote the function at 1 nominal atmosphere of pressure; the subscripts denote the temperature). The reference functionH degrees 0is the enthalpy at 101 kPa and 0 K.From the specific heat (calorimetric) measurements ofTable 7, the low-temperature Debye characteristic temperature Thetacal= ThetaDas a function of temperature was also obtained, and values are listed inTable 7; the values are plotted inFig. 29for temperatures 0 K less than T less than 30 K. From a different set of specific heat measurements, Debye characteristic temperatures were obtained and plotted inFig. 30for temperatures 0 K less than T less than 100 K. From the specific heat measurements of Table 8, values for the Debye characteristic temperature ThetaDwere obtained and are plotted inFig. 31for temperatures 0 K less than T less than 300 K. These three different plots of ThetaDcover somewhat different, but equally useful, ranges of temperature. Figure 32displays RockwellFhardness and tensile strength for the same specimens of pure silver, subjected to varying degrees of reduction by cold rolling at room temperature. Ultimate tensile strength sigmaUof annealed silver is plotted inFig. 33for temperatures from 0 K to 300 K. The effects of duration and temperature of annealing were not explored in this work (applies also toFigs. 34and44). Ultimate tensile strength (UTS) is plotted inFig. 34as a function of temperature. TheUTShas been normalized by dividing it by the fatigue strength, defined as the peak stress for fracture in 105cycles. The fatigue strength rises to a peak as the temperature is lowered below room temperature to about liquid-nitrogen temperature (78 K), but then falls off at temperatures below 78 K. The effects of duration and temperature of annealing were not explored in this work (applies also toFigs. 33and44). Figure 35gives tensile stress as a function of percent strain for cold-worked polycrystalline silver. The apparent intercept of the curve with the stress axis at 40 MPa is only an artifact; the original figure as published was quite small and the curve could not be resolved from the axis below this value. Figure 36displays stress as a function of strain for different values of stress rate and overstrain, all for the same same specimen. The source paper gives no information on the rate of stress for curves 1 and 2. Tables V and VI of the original paper give the following information: for curve 1, the limit of proportionality was 17.9 MPa (1.3 ton/in2), the 0.01 % proof stress was 45.5 MPa (3.3 ton/in2), the elastic modulus was 69.7 GPa (10.1 Mpsi), the maximum applied stress was 51.9 MPa (3.76 ton/in2), the strain at maximum stress was 10.0*10-4, and the permanent strain was 1.34*10-4. For curve 4: the maximum applied stress was 13.8 MPa (1 ton/in2), the strain at maximum stress was 8.42*10-4, and the permanent strain was 6.4*10-4. Adiabatic elastic coefficients, or moduli, (commonly termed "constants" even though they vary with temperature and pressure) are listed inTable 9. Of the six quantities listed in the table, only three are independent, and these are usually taken to beC11,C12and one adiabatic elastic shear modulus,C44. Another elastic shear modulus is defined asC'=(C11-C12)/2, the bulk modulus isB=(C11+2C12)/3, and the longitudinal elastic modulus isCL= (C11+C12+C44)/2. The elastic anisotropy is defined asC44/C'=2C44/(C11-C12). NoneThe two elastic stiffness moduliC11andC12are plotted inFig. 37as functions of temperature (the changes in slope at low temperature are artifacts of the finite number of data points). Fig. 38displays two adiabatic elastic shear moduli,C=C44andC'=(C11'C12)/2, plotted together as functions of temperature. The bulk modulusBand the longitudinal elastic modulusCLare plotted together inFig. 39as functions of temperature. All the elastic moduli are extremal at liquid-helium temperatures. Figure 40shows the elastic anisotropy coefficient 2C44/(C11-C12) as a function of temperature. It is minimal at 0 K.Young's modulusEand its temperature derivative dE/dTare plotted inFig. 41as functions of temperature. The values forEand dE/dTwere calculated from elastic-coefficient data. The creep coefficientalphais plotted inFig. 42as a function of temperature for an applied stress of 5.9 MPa. The creep strain is given by the expression? =alpha.ln(gammat+1), wheregammais a "time proportionality constant" andtis time. Values forgammawere not given in the source paper. InFig. 1of the original paper (Sec. 3.1, Ref. [128]) creep is plotted as functions of both time and log(time), but corresponding plots are not related by just a single mapping (linear to logarithmic). Careful study raises many unanswered questions, so the reader is cautioned to be careful in using the information fromFig. 1of Ref. [128]. The ratio tauNone/GNoneof flow stresstauto shear modulusG, normalized to unity atT=0, (tauNone/GNone)/(tau0/G0), is plotted inFig. 43as a function of temperature. The subscriptsTdenote temperature dependence. Tension-compression fatigue is plotted inFig. 44as a function of number of cycles to fracture for test temperatures of 4.2 K, 20 K, 90 K, and 293 K. The effects of temperature and duration of annealing were not explored in this work (applies also toFigs. 33and34). Yield strength (defined as stress at 0.005 strain) is plotted as a function of temperature for specimens of high-purity (0.9997+) silver inFig. 45. The specimens, of three different grain sizes (0.017 mm, 0.040 mm, and 0.250 mm), had been annealed at temperatures of 700 degrees C, 800 degrees C, and 900 degrees C, respectively. InFig. 46, tensile strength is plotted as a function of temperature and compared to the yield strength, for the same three grain sizes (related to annealing conditions) ofFig. 45. Fig. 47shows the velocities of dislocations moving in a 110 {111} glide system as a function of stresssigma, for specimen temperatures of 77 K and 300 K. There is a crossover at a stress of about 7 MN/m2; above this stress the dislocation velocity is greater at 77 K, but below this crossover stress the velocity is greater at 300 K.The displacement cross section as a function of electron energy required to displace a silver atom from a lattice site (in bulk silver) is graphed inFig. 48. The cross sections were normalized by dividing by the displacement cross section at 1.35 MeV, the largest electron energy used. The associated threshold energy for displacement was 28 eV. For the convenience of those working with cryogenic fluids, some useful thermodynamic properties are listed inTable 10. For commonly used cryogenic liquids at normal boiling points and for vapors at 101 kPa (1 atm), density, enthalpy, and specific heat are tabulated.

The band structure of silver was calculated using the relativistic augmented-plane-wave (RAPW) method. A plot of density of states versus energy from 0 Ryd to 1.5 Ryd (1 Ryd = 13.6 eV) is given. The Fermi energy is approximately 0.444 Ryd above the muffin-tin zero, or 0.551 Ryd above the band bottom (Gamma6+). The electronic density of states per atom at the Fermi level,N(EF), is 3.4556 Ryd-1. The band structure has been checked against optical experiments and overall agreement is very good. Mathewson, A.

The increase is attributed to the development of a film of silver sulfide on the surface of the silver. Sondheimer, E. H., The Mean Free Path of Electrons in Metals, Adv. Phys. 1(1), 1-42 (1952).

The annealing of quenched and cold-rolled silver (purities of 99.9 % and 99.999 %) was studied in the range of temperature from -40 degrees C to +250 degrees C. Distinct recovery processes were found. For quenched silver, a recovery stage attributed to migration of vacancies was found between 50 degrees C and 130 degrees C, with an activation energy of 0.88 eV. For cold-rolled silver, a recovery stage attributed to interstitial migration was found between -40 degrees C and -10 degrees C, with an activation energy of 0.60 eV. For the cold-rolled specimen, a recovery stage found above 70 degrees C was thought to be due to rearrangement and annihilation of dislocations. Bailey, J. E., and Hirsch, P.

For pure Ag,RRincreases as wires are strained at the liquid-air point to approximately 18 % extension; upon warming to room temperature,RRof the wires decreases by one third. Further strain at liquid-air temperature increasesRRwith a slope (RRvs strain) steeper than that before the wires were warmed. Barnard, B. R., Caplin, A. D. Dalimin, M. N.

The incremental change in electrical resistivity of silver from 1 K to 9 K, at various stages of cold work, is plotted.

Phys. 3/9, 26-83 (1954). The theory and experiments dealing with the effect of lattice defects on electrical resistivity in pure metals and alloys are reviewed. Because deformed metals generally obey Matthiessen's Rule, the absolute change in resistivity Deltarhois generally independent of temperature. From an empirical point of view, however, it is convenient to use the relative change in resistivity Deltarho/rho0whererho0is the reference value of resistivity. The reference value is usually taken to be that measured at room temperature. For 10 % extension of silver, the relative change in resistivity at room temperature is 0.5 % (for a reference valuerho0= 1.59 muOmega.cm at 20 degrees C). After drawing of silver wire to a 98 % reduction in cross section, the relative increase in resistivity is 5 %. Values of Deltarhoafter irradiation of silver at -140 degrees C by 12 MeV deuterons are plotted as a function of deuteron flux. Molenaar, J., and Aarts, W. H., Change of Resistivity by Cold Working at Liquid-Air Temperature, Nature166, 690 (1950). Relative changes of resistivity with relative extension (strain) for Ag and Cu wires at 90 K are plotted; the silver wire was first drawn to 12 % extension, soft-annealed, and then further stretched to 17 %. Although the tension-deformation curve showed no discontinuity, the relative resistivity was reduced at the point where the deformation was halted for warming the specimen. The magnitude of the discontinuity in relative resistivity depends sensitively on the annealing temperature. Averback, R. S., Benedek, R., and Merkle, K. L., Ion-irradiation studies of the damage function of copper and silver, Phys. Rev. B18(8), 4156-4171 (1978). Ions (H, D, He, Li, B, C, N, O, Ne, Cl, Ar, Fe, Cu, Kr, Ag, and Bi) with kinetic energies of the order of tens to hundreds of keV were used to irradiate thin foils of Ag and Cu (thick enough to stop the incident ions). The resulting damage increased the electrical resistivity of the foils. Results are tabulated and graphed. Broom, T., Lattice Defects and the Electrical Resistivity of Metals, Adv.

Damage in 14 high-purity metallic elements was caused by capture (98.2 % thermal in silver) of neutrons at 3.6 K, producing a change in electrical resistivity. Recovery was programmed with 60 heating pulses 5 min in duration. The isochronal recovery from damage by thermal-neutron capture is plotted as a function of temperature. The isochronal recovery for silver shows a largest peak at 30 K, a second-highest peak at 300 K, and two smaller peaks at 170 K and 140 K attributed to the effects of impurities. Lucasson, P.

Thin cylindrical films of 99.9999 % pure silver were formed by evaporating silver onto rotating glass fibers at room temperature. The magnetore-sistance in the weakly localized regime was investigated in longitudinal magnetic fields (up to 0.3T) and at four different temperatures from 1.58 K to 4.2 K. At fields of less than 8 mT, oscillations in magnetoresistance were observed with a period ofh/2e(the magnetic flux quantum), and confirms the predictions of a theory of Altshuler, Aronov and Spivak [Pis'ma Zh.

Stress-strain curves for thin silver joints brazed in tubular steel specimens, at large strains, and shear stress under plastic strain, at room temperature, are plotted. Both the yield strength and the work hardening rate were increased by the presence of the rigid interfaces.

The total hemispherical absorptivity of electroplated silver at 75.8 K was measured as a function of blackbody-radiation (BBR) temperatures from 268 K to 367 K. Over this range the total hemispherical absorptivity decreases with increasing BBR temperature. The normal absorptivity increases with increasing mean wavelength. Corruccini, R.

The total hemispherical emissivities (THE) of 51 specimens of commercially available metals or metals of technical grade were measured by radiative heat transport between surfaces at 300 K and 76 K. The THE of silver plated on copper was 0.017 K at 76 K and 0.013 K at 20 K. An unbuffed silver-plated surface ("careful preparation"; nickel and copper strike on stainless steel) had the lowest THE (0.007). For best results electroplated surfaces should be of high purity, dense, and fairly thick. Buffing a surface does not help; the absorptivities of some surfaces increase if they are mechanically polished.

This advanced textbook reviews the macroscopic theory, the classical electron theory, and the quantum theory of the optical properties of metals, including the anomalous skin effect. The theoretical value for the beginning of the absorption band in silver is 4.7*10-5cm; the experimental value is 3.1*10-5. At optical frequencies (lambda= 600 nm) the effective conductivity sigma is 4*1013s-1. The permittivityepsilonat low frequencies is -3*105. The effective electron mass is 0.97me.

For most of the quantities indicated above the data are also plotted. Because of the paucity of data for silver, no recommended values are given. Chambers, R.

Rev. 98(6), 1699-1707 (1955). Plots of atomic (specific) heats of Cu, Ag ("99.98 % purity") and Au are given for the range 1 K less than T less than 5 K. From these data the electronic specific heat,gamma, and (low-temperature, calorimetric) Debye temperature, ThetaD, are determined and compared with other work. They givegamma= 0.610 mJ/(mol.K) and ThetaD= 225.3 K. The authors found evidence for errors in the 1948 helium vapor-pressure-temperature scale, already suggested by earlier work; their values ofgammaand ThetaDhave been corrected by removal of the effect of the temperature-scale errors.
