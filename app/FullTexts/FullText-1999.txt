A central goal in stem cell biology is to understand the mechanisms of tissue regeneration and renewal used by diverse organs. In the case of the rodent incisor, continuous growth relies on stem cells that share several characteristics with other regenerating adult systemsNone-None. These include residence in a discrete niche, slow division kinetics with respect to surrounding cells, and the ability to give rise to differentiated lineages throughout the life of the animal. Label retaining experiments in mice utilizing either BrdU incorporation or genetic labeling with a tetracycline inducible Histone 2B-GFP (H2BGFP) reporter demonstrated that a population of slowly dividing epithelial stem cells was present in a structure called the labial cervical loop (LaCL) at the proximal end of the incisorNone,None. Lineage tracing experiments showed that these cells gave rise to the highly proliferative transit-amplifying (T-A) cells that then differentiated into enamel-secreting ameloblastsNone-None. Genetic analyses have shown that development of the incisor stem cells is controlled by TGF-beta/BMP and FGF signalingNone,Noneand that adult stem cells require active SHH signaling to produce differentiated progenyNone. However, it remains relatively unknown how homeostasis is regulated in the adult LaCL. BecauseBmi1plays a key role in adult stem cell homeostasis in a number of mammalian tissuesNone,None,None,None, we set out to study the role ofBmi1in the adult incisor. To investigateBmi1expression, we utilizedBmi1Nonereporter mice, in which the second exon ofBmi1was replaced by GFP, resulting in a null alleleNone. InBmi1Noneadult mice, GFP was expressed in cells of the stellate reticulum (SR) and in the outer enamel epithelium (OEE), where the LaCL stem cells reside (Fig. 1a-c). These cells underwent infrequent cell divisionsNoneand thus retained H2B-GFP or BrdU after extended chase periods (Fig. 1b,2f), similar to stem cells of the hair follicle bulgeNone. In addition, inBmi1None;Gli1None+mice,Bmi1Nonewas co-expressed withGli1None, a marker for adult dental stem cellsNone(Supplementary Fig. S1a-d). Together, these data suggested thatBmi1marks the incisor stem cells. To determine whetherBmi1-expressing cells are indeed stem cells that can give rise to differentiated cell types over a long period of time, we performed inducible genetic lineage tracing. This technique permanently labels a cell and its progeny and definitively identifies adult stem cellsin vivoNone. To this end, we genetically labeledBmi1-expressing cells and traced their descendants using an inducibleBmi1NonestrainNonecrossed to a Cre-responsive reporter line (R26R-Tm-GFP)None. Induction of Cre activity by tamoxifen injection results in permanent expression of GFP inBmi1-expressing cells and their progeny. While we did not detect GFP labeling in uninjectedBmi1None/+;R26R-Tm-GFPmice (Fig. 1d), we observed a few labeled cells in the LaCL and surrounding mesenchyme 3 days after tamoxifen injection (Fig. 1e, insert). GFP was also observed in blood vessels (Fig. 1e, arrowhead), consistent with a previous report ofBmi1expression in endotheliumNone. By 7 days after tamoxifen injection, increased numbers of GFP-positive cells were observed in the LaCL and mesenchyme (Fig. 1f). Importantly, as cells in the pre-ameloblast region move ~350 mum per dayNone,None, the appearance of GFP-positive pre-ameloblasts in the dental epithelium (Fig. 1f, arrow) several days after tamoxifen injection established the production of differentiated cells fromBmi1-positive progenitors. Longer chases revealed the accumulation of labeled cells in the LaCL, indicating that LaCL stem cells had undergone self-renewal (Fig. 1g,h). The appearance of groups of labeled ameloblasts suggested that each cluster represented the progeny of a single stem cell whose descendants underwent several rounds of replication. Together, the expression and lineage tracing data demonstrated thatBmi1-expressing cells in the LaCL are stem cells. Next, to identify the function ofBmi1in the mouse incisor, we analyzed the architecture of the dental epithelium inBmi1null animals (Bmi1None, hereafter referred to asBmi1-/-) at 5 months of age by performing haematoxylin and eosin staining. Bmi1-/-animals had LaCLs that were consistently thinner in both the sagittal and coronal planes, with a substantial decrease in the amount of SR compared toBmi1+/+siblings (Fig. 2a,h). To obtain a clearer picture of the morphological defect inBmi1-/-LaCLs, we prepared 3D reconstructions of the LaCL fromBmi1+/+andBmi1-/-animals. The 3D reconstructions demonstrated a significant loss of tissue in the LaCL, specifically in the SR on the labial side (Fig. 2b,i, andSupplementary Fig. S2). On average,Bmi1-/-LaCLs showed a 28% decrease in total volume compared to controls (Fig. 2v). We then asked if the expression profile was altered inBmi1-/-LaCLs by analyzing markers of dental epithelium. E-cadherin is normally expressed in stem cells residing in the SR and OEE and downregulated in the T-A zoneNone(Fig. 2c). Conversely, P-cadherin is absent in the stem cell region but upregulated in the T-A regionNone(Fig. 2e). InBmi1-/-LaCLs, the domain of E-cadherin expression was smaller (Fig. 2j), and P-cadherin staining was expanded posteriorly into the OEE (Fig. 2l, asterisk), indicating that cells in this region assumed a more differentiated character. We next examined the expression of integrin alpha 6 (ITGA6), a marker of hematopoieticNone, neuralNone, trachealNone, and epidermalNonestem cells that is also expressed in the dental epithelial stem cellsNone. Similar to E-cadherin, ITGA6 is normally expressed in the SR and OEE of the LaCL (Fig. 2d), and its domain of expression was dramatically smaller in the LaCL ofBmi1-/-animals (Fig. 2k). Together, the expression pattern of these markers indicated that a loss ofBmi1activity caused a reduction in the size of the stem cell-containing region in the incisor. BecauseBmi1is known to regulate stem cell self-renewalNone,None,None, we asked whether the reduction of cells in theBmi1-/-LaCLs was due at least in part to a reduced population of stem cells, using BrdU label retention as a marker of these cellsNone,None. We administered BrdU to perinatalBmi1+/+andBmi1-/-pups and analyzed the number of label-retaining cells (LRCs) in 6-week-old adult mice (Fig. 2f,m). On average,Bmi1-/-LaCLs had 45% fewer LRCs compared toBmi1+/+controls (Fig. 2w), indicating thatBmi1regulates stem cell number in the incisor. Similarly low levels of apoptosis were observed in the mutants and controls (Supplementary Fig. S1e,f). Finally, asBmi1-expressing stem cells give rise to enamel-secreting ameloblasts, we compared the mineralized enamel inBmi1+/+andBmi1-/-lower incisors using microtomography scans (microCT). In 5-month-oldBmi1+/+adults, mature enamel was present in a swath that extended from a region proximal to the molars to the distal tip of the tooth (Fig. 2g). In contrast, matureBmi1-/-enamel receded to a position between the proximal and distal roots of the first molar, indicating defective enamel formation byBmi1-/-progeny (Fig. 2n). In other contexts, BMI1 and other polycomb group proteins preserve stem cell self-renewal through repression of theInk4a/Arflocus, which encodes two tumor suppressor proteins that negatively regulate the cell cycleNone,None,None. AsInk4a/Arfwas also upregulated in theBmi1null incisor epithelium (Fig. 3a), it was possible that BMI1 functions similarly in mouse incisor stem cells by repressingInk4a/Arfexpression. To test this possibility and to dissect phenotypes associated withInk4a/Arfupregulation, we bredBmi1-/-;Ink4a/Arf-/-triple mutants. We first observed that the additional loss ofInk4a/Arfwas able to restore LaCL volume (Fig. 2o,p,v). Ink4a/Arfdeletion also partially rescued LRC number (Fig. 2t,w), consistent with the notion thatBmi1is required to maintain an adequate population of stem cells for homeostasis by repressingInk4a/Arfexpression. However, the incompleteness of the rescue pointed to the existence of additional BMI1 targets that may contribute to the mutant phenotype. Similarly, in other organs, deletion ofInk4a/ArfinBmi1null animals was insufficient to completely rescue either the morphological defectsNoneor the maintenance of downstream lineage specificationNone. Indeed, the marker expression pattern of theBmi1-/-;Ink4a/Arf-/-mutant LaCL resembled that of theBmi1null incisor, with diminished E-cadherin and ITGA6 expression in the SR and OEE, accompanied by an expanded P-cadherin domain (Fig. 2q-s), suggesting thatBmi1maintains incisor stem cell identity through mechanisms that do not involveInk4a/Arf. Importantly, despite the rescue in LaCL size,Bmi1-/-;Ink4a/Arf-/-mice exhibited defects in enamel deposition (Fig. 2u), a phenotype that is likely due to abnormal gene expression in stem cells and their progeny. To identify additional BMI1 targets, we performed microarray analysis on dental epithelia from control andBmi1null incisors. In addition toInk4a/Arf, many other genes were upregulated in the mutants, including 9Hoxgenes from 3 different Hox clusters (Fig. 3a). To validate the upregulation ofHoxgenes inBmi1null dental epithelia, we performed RT-PCR onBmi1+/+andBmi1-/-LaCLs. WhereasHoxa7,b7, andc6transcripts were undetectable in control LaCLs, their expression was readily detected inBmi1-/-LaCLs (Fig. 3b). Similarly,Hoxc9anda9expression was dramatically increased in theBmi1-/-LaCLs. Thus, BMI1 suppressed the expression of severalHoxgenes in the LaCL, suggesting that de-repressedHoxtranscription may lead to premature differentiation. Gene ontology analysis further confirmed this notion, as genes associated with differentiation were upregulated in the mutants (Fig. 3candSupplementary Table S1). Specifically, genes important for enamel formation that are normally expressed in maturing ameloblasts, such asamelotin(Amtn) andkallikrein-related peptidase(Klk4)None,None, were prematurely upregulated in the LaCL (Supplementary Table S1). It was next important to determine if BMI1-mediated repression ofHoxgenes was functionally required for the regulation of adult incisor stem cells. We utilized a tissue culture systemNone,Noneto enable concurrent manipulation ofHoxexpression levels in incisor stem cells. LaCL epithelia fromBmi1+/+orBmi1-/-incisors were dissociated to create single cell suspensions. 10 days after plating control cells, three morphological types of colonies appeared, with the majority composed of small and tightly packed cells that continued to express E-cadherin, suggesting that they maintained some of the incisor stem cell characteristics (Supplementary Fig. S3a-g). In contrast, dissociated LaCL cells fromBmi1-/-incisors grew very poorly and produced far fewer colonies (Supplementary Fig. S3h), consistent with upregulation ofInk4a/Arfand the self-renewal defects described above, but no change in apoptosis was observed in culturedBmi1-/-cells (Supplementary Fig. S1g,h). Finally, sorting of cells fromBmi1GFP/+animals showed that cells with higher GFP expression (GFPHI) produced significantly more colonies than cells with low GFP (GFPLO) (Supplementary Fig. S3i,j). Together, these data supported the functional results and confirmed thatBmi1is required to maintain dental epithelial stem cells. We then tested whetherInk4a/Arfdeletion could rescue the colony-forming defect associated with loss ofBmi1activity by culturing LaCL cells fromBmi1-/-;Ink4a/Arf-/-mice. In contrast to theBmi1mutants, the dissociatedBmi1-/-;Ink4a/Arf-/-LaCL cells readily formed colonies that were comparable in numbers to the control (Supplementary Fig. S3h), however theBmi1-/-;Ink4a/Arf-/-colonies contained larger cells (Fig. 4a,b). We reasoned that whereasBmi1-/-cells normally cannot self-renew due to elevatedInk4a/Arfexpression, deletion of theInk4a/Arflocus enabled these cells to proliferate. The altered morphology inBmi1-/-;Ink4a/Arf-/-cells suggested that BMI1 additionally regulates a developmental program that is independent ofInk4a/Arfexpression. Consistent with this notion, the transcriptomes ofBmi1-/-;Ink4a/Arf-/-colonies were dramatically different from wild-type controls and very similar toBmi1-/-colonies (Supplementary Fig. S4). Thus, BMI1 must additionally control cell morphology and differentiation by regulating the expression of other genes. To test whether upregulation ofHoxgenes was an important contributor to the mutant phenotype inBmi1null incisors, we used lentiviral transduction to introduce shRNAs againstHoxa9andHoxc9. These genes were the most upregulatedHoxfamily members in bothBmi1-/-andBmi1-/-;Ink4a/Arf-/-mutants as well as in colonies derived from these animals (Fig. 3a,Fig. 4 g,h). qPCR results demonstrated that the shRNAs effectively knocked downHoxa9andHoxc9, whereas control scrambled sequences did not (Fig. 4 g,h). Furthermore, the doubly-infected colonies exhibited morphology and cell size similar to controls (Fig. 4 a,c,f). The rescue by Hoxa9/c9 shRNAs coincided with upregulation ofCdh1(encoding E-cadherin) andItga6and with downregulation ofCdh3(encoding P-cadherin),Amtn, andKlk4(Fig. 4 i-m,Supplementary Fig. S5c-g), although single knockdown of either Hox gene alone did not show a clear rescue (Supplementary Fig. S5h,i), most likely due to functional redundancy. Thus, reducingHoxa9/c9expression reconstituted the incisor epithelial stem cell expression signature, which indicated that deregulated expression ofHoxa9andHoxc9was at least partially responsible for the changes in stem cell morphology and gene expression inBmi1-/-cells. Repression ofHoxgenes in the adult dental stem cells is therefore an important function ofBmi1, and this finding led us to predict that overexpression ofHoxgenes in the LaCL would phenocopy theBmi1-/-mutants. To that end, we first introduced exogenousHoxa9/c9by lentiviral transduction into cultured control LaCL cells (Fig. 4e,g,h). This overexpression caused enlarged cell size, downregulated expression ofCdh1andItga6,and upregulatedAmtnandKlk4expression, all of which are characteristic of theBmi1-/-mutants (Fig. 4f,i-m). However,Cdh3expression was not altered, suggesting that additional genes and/or factors were required for its upregulation. To further test whetherHoxgenes function similarlyin vivo, we generatedGli1None/+;R26Nonemice, in which ectopicHoxc9expression and a YFP Cre-reporter were induced specifically in the LaCL stem cells by tamoxifen injection (Fig. 5 a,f). Overexpression ofHoxc9led to downregulation of E-cadherin and ITGA6 in the SR and OEE and to expanded P-cadherin expression (Fig. 5b-d,g-i), matching the gene expression phenotype exhibited by theBmi1-/-mutants, although LaCL size was not affected (Fig. 5e,j,k). Together, these data demonstrate thatBmi1-positive cells in the LaCL are adult stem cells and thatBmi1function is required to maintain these cells through two distinct mechanisms (Fig. 5l). The first is via repression ofInk4a/Arfexpression to permit stem cell self-renewal, a well-documented function ofBmi1in other systemsNone,None,None. However, theBmi1-/-phenotype was not fully rescued by the deletion ofInk4a/Arf, and thus, prevention of arrested cell division is not the sole function of BMI1. We found that the second function of BMI1 is to suppress the expression ofHoxgenes to prevent inappropriate cell differentiation. A similar observation was made in theDrosophilatestis, where mutated polycomb genes resulted inAbdominal-Bupregulation and abnormal cyst stem cell differentiationNone, hinting at an evolutionarily conserved role forBmi1in regulating stem cell differentiation. It is notable that upregulation ofHoxgenes has also been documented in otherBmi1-/-adult stem cellsNone,None,None-None, and it will be important to consider the role of repression ofHoxgenes and other targets by BMI1 in those systems. For example, in haematopoietic stem cells,Ebf1andPax5Noneregulate lineage specification, and their upregulation inBmi1mutants causes a lineage shift during haematopoiesis. In theBmi1null incisor, we observed upregulation of genes associated with maturing ameloblasts in addition to upregulation ofHoxgenes, which is likely the cause of the abnormal enamel deposition byBmi1-/-ameloblasts. Thus, we propose thatBmi1has two distinct functions: (1) maintain adequate stem cell self-renewal by suppressingInk4a/Arfand (2) prevent inappropriate differentiation by inhibiting the expression ofHoxgenes and other genes important for cellular maturation (Fig. 5i). Mice carrying the Bmi1GFPNone, Bmi1CreERNone, Gli1CreERNone, Gli1lacZNone, K5tTANone, R26R-Tm-GFPNone, andH2B-GFPNonealleles or transgenes were maintained and genotyped as previously described. ForR26None/+, chicken (Gallus gallus)Hoxc9was cloned and inserted into the ROSA locus as describedNone,None. PCR genotyping for theR26Noneallele was performed using the following primers: R26wt_FW: 5'-AAAGTCGCTCTGAGTTGTTAT-3', R26wt_REV: 5'-GGAGCGGGAGAAATGGATATG-3', and R26loxC9_REV: 5'-GTTATGTAACGCGGAACTCCA-3'. Gli1None;R26Nonemice were subsequently generated by matingGli1None/+;R26None/+male toR26Nonefemales. For lineage-tracing studies, 5 mg Tamoxifen dissolved in corn oil was injected IP into adult mice between 8 and 12 weeks of age at 5 mg per 25 g body weight. For label retention studies, postnatal day 2 animals were injected with 200 mug BrdU for 3 consecutive days and sacrificed after 6 weeks. At least three mice were examined at each time point for all experiments. Unless specified in the main text, 6-week-old mice were used. Both male and female mice were included in this study. All shRNAs were designed using pSicoOligomaker 1.5 and cloned into the pSicoR-GFP vector (Tyler Jacks lab protocols,http://web.mit.edu/jacks-lab/protocols_table.html). Two sets of shRNAs against Hoxa9 and Hoxc9 were designed. The antisense sequences are:Hoxa9(1stset): TTAATGCCATAAGGCCGGC,Hoxa9scrambled (1stset): TACTATCGGTAACGGACGC,Hoxa9(2ndset): TAAACAGAAACTCCTTCTC,Hoxa9scrambled (2ndset): AGTCTACAACTATTCACAC,Hoxc9(1stset): ATTGAAGAGAAACTCCTTC,Hoxc9scrambled (1stset): ACATGAATTAAGTTCCGAC,Hoxc9(2ndset): ATAGACCACAGACGACTGC,Hoxc9scrambled (2ndset): ACGTACGAGAAACAGCTCC. Lentiviral packaging was performed using a 3rdgeneration packaging system (Addgene) according to established protocols. Thein vitroculture system was modeled after a system for culture of hair follicle stem cellsNone-Noneand has been previously publishedNone. Briefly, whole incisors, including the entire dental epithelium, were isolated from mandibles and incubated in collagenase (Worthington) for 4 hours on ice. Labial cervical loops were mechanically isolated and dissociated in 100 mul Accumax (Sigma) at 37 degrees C for 1 hour using gentle pippetting. Cells were counted and plated at a density of 15,000 cells per well on a 6 well plate. Colonies were then either harvested for RNA extraction or counted and imaged on a Leica inverted microscope after 10 days. All experiments were performed at least three times. Colony forming efficiency was expressed as a ratio of the number of small-cell containing colonies divided by the total number of plated cells. Cell sizes were measured using ImageJ (n = 3 independent experiments, and 100 cells were scored for each experiment). LaCLs fromBmi1None/+andBmi1+/+mice were isolated and dissociated as described above. Single cell suspensions were sorted for GFP expression using a FACSAria 2 cell sorter (BD Biosciences) at the Eli and Edythe Broad Center of Regeneration Medicine and Stem Cell Research at UCSF, Cell Analysis core. Two separate experiments were performed. The epithelium was outlined from ~40 consecutive 7 mum thick coronal sections at the most proximal end of the mouse incisor (n = 4 animals per genotype). BioVis software (http://www.biovis3d.com) was used to generate 3-dimensional (3D) reconstructions from this data and to calculate the volume of the structures. Total RNA from dissected whole LaCLs or colonies was extracted using the Ambion Mirvana RNA Isolation kit. Sample preparation, labeling, and array hybridizations were performed according to standard protocols from the UCSF Shared Microarray Core Facilities and Agilent Technologies (http://www.arrays.ucsf.eduandhttp://www.agilent.com). Total RNA quality was assessed using a Pico Chip on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). The datasets were normalized using thequantilenormalization methodNone. No background subtraction was performed, and the median feature pixel intensity was used as the raw signal before normalization. A one-way ANOVA linear model was fit to the comparison to estimate the mean M values and calculate moderated t-statistic, B statistic, false discovery rate, and p-value for each gene for the comparison of interest. All procedures were carried out using functions in the R packagelimma in Bioconductor. Gene ontology analysis was performed using the Term Enrichment tool in AmiGO (http://amigo.geneontology.org). For qPCR analysis, cDNA was generated using the Advantage RT for PCR kit (Clontech), and Taqman assays (Ambion) were used to perform qPCR. Primers forHoxc9,Amtn,Klk4, andL19were ordered from IDT PrimeTime. Primer sequences forHoxa9,Cdh1,Cdh3, andItga6are:Hoxa9: forward- GAATGAGAGCGGCGGAGAC, reverse- GAGCGAGCATGTAGCCAGTTG,Cdh1: forward- AATGAAGCCCCCATCTTTAT, reverse- GAGATGGACAGAGAAGACGC,Cdh3: forward-CCGCATCTTAAGGAGACGAA, reverse- AAATCTTGGTGCCTCTGTCC,Itga6: forward- GGAGCCTCTTCGGCTTCTC, reverse- AGTGCTTCTGCCCGAGGT. All samples were normalized to L19. CT values were extracted, and relative gene expression levels were calculated using the DeltaDeltaCT method. All experiments were performed at least three times. Jaws were dissected from perfusion-fixed animals, post-fixed in 4% PFA overnight, decalcified in RNase-free 0.5 M EDTA for 16 days, and processed for paraffin embedding. 7 mum sections were prepared and stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin using standard methods. For all images shown, representative samples were chosen after sectioning through the entire jaw, in order to avoid plane of section artifacts. Brightfield images were obtained using a Leica DFC 500 camera with a Leica DM 5000B microscope. For immunostaining, paraffin sections were rehydrated, incubated in 1mM EDTA just below boiling temperature for 30 min for antigen retrieval, washed in distilled H2O, and treated for 20 min with 3% H2O2in PBS. Primary antibodies against GFP (1:5000, Torrey Pines, TP401), E-cadherin (1:1000, Invitrogen,131900), P-cadherin (1:1000, Invitrogen,132000Z), BrdU (1:500, Abcam, ab6326), and ITGA6 (1:1000, Santa Cruz, sc-10730) were used. Washes in PBS (3 * 20 min) and PBS-T (1 * 5 min) were followed by incubation with Alexa fluor 488 and 555 secondary antibodies (1:500, Invitrogen) or biotinylated anti-rat secondary antibody (Vector BA-4001) followed by signal amplification (Perkin Elmer). Sections were counterstained with DAPI (Vector Laboratories) and mounted in 1% DABCO in glycerol. Images were acquired using a Leica-TCS SP5 confocal microscope. BrdU staining was quantified using ImageJ. TUNEL staining was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Roche 12156792910). All experiments were performed at least three times. Hemimandibles (n = 3 per genotype) were imaged under wet conditions using a Micro XCT (Xradia, Pleasanton, CA) at a 2X magnification using a tungsten anode setting of 90keV and 66 microamps. Virtual sections from reconstructed tomographs were used to study the X-ray attenuation of incisor enamel across groups under identical experimental parameters and at similar sectioning planes. For statistical analyses, mean values with standard deviation (s.d.) are shown in most graphs. All experiments were performed independently at least three times, and the exact n numbers are listed in the figure legends. Pvalues were obtained from student t-tests with paired samples. P less than 0.05 was determined to be significant for all experiments. ActualPvalues are shown in each figure or figure legend. Gene Expression Omnibus: GSE46001
