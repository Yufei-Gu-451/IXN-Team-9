The cell cycle is conserved in all eukaryotes, with G1/S and G2/M being regulated by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). In plants, greater than 160 CDK-related genes have been cloned from greater than 20 higher plant species and are apportioned into classes A-G and CDK-like (DuditsNone., 2007). The CDKB family is unique to plants. InArabidopsis, CDKA;1 activity peaks at G1/S and G2/M, whereas CDKB2;1 peaks at G2/M (JoubesNone., 2000). In tobacco BY-2 cells, CDKA activity is relatively constant from S-phase to mitosis, whereas B-type activity peaks in mid-G2(PorcedduNone., 2001;SorrellNone., 2001). InSchizosaccahromyces pombe, the CDK, Cdc2, is phosphoregulated in G2, negatively by SpWee1 kinase and positively by SpCdc25 phosphatase (Nurse, 1990). A partialWEE1homologue was cloned in maize and inhibits CDK activityin vitro(SunNone., 1999) whilst a full-lengthArabidopsis WEE1is highly expressed in meristems (SorrellNone., 2002). T-DNA insertional lines are hypersensitive to DNA-damaging agents, demonstrating that AtWEE1 participates in the DNA damage and replication checkpoints (De SchutterNone, 2007). However, the role of WEE1 in a normal cell cycle remains uncertain since T-DNA insertional lines grow and develop normally. This is in contrast toWee1Nonemice that die during embryogenesis (TominagaNone., 2006). However, a systematic analysis of cell cycle gene expression duringArabidopsisdevelopment shows tight regulation ofWEE1expression during the cell cycle in plants, as indicated by patchy expression patterns in parts of the young and mature leaves, shoot apical meristem, and young roots (de Almeida EnglerNone, 2009). Furthermore, there may be a role for WEE1 during endoreduplication given thatWEE1transcript levels were high during this process both in the endosperm ofZea mays(SunNone., 1999) and in tomato fruit (GonzalezNone., 2004,2007). The latter authors concluded that tomato WEE1 negatively regulates CDKA activity to control cell size acting through a regulation of cell expansion and/or endoreduplication. However, in these systems, neither WEE1 protein nor the ability of WEE1 from plant protein extracts to inhibit CDK activity was measured and linked to the cell cycle phase. Timely degradation of regulatory proteins has a critical effect on cell cycle progression. The most widely studied method of proteolysis in eukaryotes is the ubiquitin-26S proteasome pathway. Its mechanism is widely conserved among eukaryotes, including plants (reviewed bySullivanNone., 2003). One of the components of the ubiquitin cascade is E3 ligase, which provides the specificity to the target protein. Several types of E3 ligase exist in eukaryotes. The SCF E3 ligase complex consists of four subunits. S PHASE KINASE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 1 (SKP1) and CULLIN provide the structural backbone, while RBX is a ring finger protein which binds the E2, or ubiquitin-conjugating, enzyme. Finally an F-box protein binds to SKP1, providing specificity to the target protein (SkowyraNone., 1997;DeshaiesNone, 1999;ZhengNone., 2002). InArabidopsis, 692 F-box genes have been identified through homology searches (XuNone., 2009), although only a relatively small number of these proteins have been studied functionally. In budding yeast and mammalian cells, two E3 ligases, SCF and APC, are important components of the degradatory pathways that remove unwanted cell cycle proteins such as WEE1 kinase and cyclins. Their timely removal is followed by normal G2/M and metaphase/anaphase progression (KingNone., 1995;FeldmanNone., 1997;SkowyraNone., 1997). InXenopus laevis, the degradation of WEE1 via the 26S proteasome is required for the correct timing of mitosis, and was blocked by inhibition of DNA replication, clearly indicating a link between the completion of S-phase and the progression of mitosis (Michael and Newport, 1998). TheSaccharomyces cerevisiaeWEE1 homologue, SWE1, is targeted for degradation by a SUMO (small-ubiquitin modifier protein, similar to ubiquitin) protein, SMT3, via the E3 ligase SIZ1 (Simpson-Lavy and Brandeis, 2010). F-box proteins including MET30 are implicated in WEE1 degradation, inS. cerevisiae(KaiserNone., 1998), as is TOME-1 inXenopus(AyadNone., 2003). The most comprehensive study of WEE1 kinase activity during the cell cycle was carried out for HeLa cells, where WEE1 kinase activity was detected during interphase but not in mitosis (McGowan and Russell, 1995). In these assays, native WEE1 was pulled-down using human WEE1 antibody and then used to inhibit CDK activity in histone H1 kinase assays (McGowan and Russell, 1995). The aim of this work was to test the hypothesis that plant WEE1 action is under cell cycle control, and investigate the mechanism by which CDKs are released from WEE1 inhibition as cells enter mitosis. Data presented here show, for the first time in plant cells, cell cycle regulation of WEE1 at the protein level and a drop in WEE1 inhibition of CDK activity during G2that remained low as cells entered mitosis. Data presented here indicate that WEE1 protein degradation in plants is 26S proteasome dependent and targeted via the protein's physical interaction with the 26S proteasome F-box protein, SKIP1. Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) BY-2 cells were subcultured every 7 d and synchronized as described previously (FrancisNone., 1995). At hourly intervals following removal of aphidicolin, the mitotic index was derived from scoring greater than =300 Hoechst-stained cells per slide in random transects using fluorescence microscopy (Olympus BH2, UV, lambda=420nm). Degenerate primers were designed based on the maizeZmWEE1(accession no. AAD52983) andAtWEE1(accession number: CAD28679) (Supplementary Table S2available atJXBonline) and used to amplify a 339bp fragment ofNtWEE1fromN. tabacumvar. Samsun genomic DNA. The PCR product was cloned in pGEM T-Easy (Promega, Southampton, UK) and sequenced. One cycle of 3' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and two cycles of 5' RACE (using the BD SMARTTM RACE cDNA amplification Kit, Clontech) furbished the whole open reading frame (ORF) (EMBL database accession nos: AJ866274, AJ866275, AJ866276, and AJ866277). The entire ORF was amplified (primers are given inSupplementary Table S2) from BY-2 cDNA and cloned into pTA7002 by digestion withXhoI/SpeI, creating pTA7002NtWEE1. The ORF was fully sequenced (EMBL database accession no. AM408785). Clustal W within DNAstar (Lasergene), BIOEDIT version 7.0.1 (Hall, 1999), and MEGA software version 3.1 (TamuraNone., 2007) were used to compare the tobacco ORF with other wee1 sequences. pTA7002NtWEE1was transformed intoAgrobacterium tumefaciens LBA4404andGV3101and used to transform BY-2 cells andArabidopsisvar. Columbia, respectively, as described previously (An, 1985;Clough and Bent, 1998;OrchardNone., 2005). Total RNA was extracted from BY-2 cells using TRI reagent (Sigma Aldrich, Gillingham, UK) and residual genomic DNA removed by DNase treatment (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA). RNA (5 ug) was reacted with Superscript II reverse transcriptase (GIBCO, Paisley, UK) and used for semi-quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) ofNtWEE1expression in synchronized cells (primers are listed inSupplementary Table S2atJXBonline). Histone H4 primers (Supplementary Table S2) were used to verify cell cycle stage, and 18S rRNA primers for normalization (OrchardNone., 2005). For all semi-quantitative RT-PCRs, the cycle number was optimized such that the amount of product was proportional to the amount of input total RNA, verified using a dilution series of cDNAs in each PCR. Products of three replicate PCRs were quantified using ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels and GeneGenius software (Syngene, Cambridge, UK). Protein extraction fromN. tabacumBY-2 cell cultures was essentially performed as described inCockcroftNone. (2000). Protein extract concentrations were determined using a Bradford assay (Bradford, 1976; Bradford Reagent, Sigma, Dorset, UK) to ensure equal loading on SDS-gels and western blots (20 ug). Loading was also verified using replicate Coomassie brilliant blue-stained gels. The WEE1 antibody used was as described inLentz GronlundNone(2009). Western blotting was as described inLentz GronlundNone(2009)using a WEE1 antibody dilution of 1:1000 followed by alpha-rabbit IgG (1:2500) (Sigma, Dorset, UK). Proteins were visualized by western blotting using ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences, Amersham, UK) and quantified using an internal control to normalize across different gels and GeneGenius software (Syngene, Cambridge, UK). Quantified data presented are the means of three independent western blots for protein levels and two gels for the kinase assays (+/-SE). The coding sequences ofNtWEE1andAt14-3-3omegawere PCR amplified (primers are listed inSupplementary Table S2atJXBonline) usingPfupolymerase and cloned into the pET15B vector system usingNdeI/BamHI. The insertions were verified by sequencing and the plasmids were transformed intoEscherichia coliDE3 Rosetta pLysS cells. Recombinant protein was induced with isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and the purity of the recombinant proteins was analysed by SDS-PAGE. The CDK substrate for the kinase assays was pulled down fromN. tabacumBY-2 cells using a p13SUC1agarose conjugate (Upstate) from 100-250 ug of protein extract. WEE1 protein was immunoprecipitated from 100 ug of protein extracts fromN. tabacumBY-2 cells at different times following synchronization using WEE1 antibody raised as described inLentz GronlundNone(2009). The histone H1 assay was essentially as described inCockroftNone(2000)using 5 ul of NtWEE1 antibody. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Products were quantitated from autoradiographs using GeneGenius software (Syngene). Results are expressed as the percentage inhibition of CDK activity normalized to the control CDK activity without addition of recombinant WEE1. Results are based on two independent replicates. The bait plasmid pBD-Gal4-camAtWEE1was constructed as described inLentz GronlundNone(2009). AnArabidopsisseedling root primary cDNA library was constructed in the HybriZAP-2.1 lambda vector (Stratagene) (SorrellNone., 2003). The primary library was amplified and converted byin vivoexcision into a GAL4 transcriptional activation domain pAD-GAL4-2.1 library according to the manufacturer's protocol (Stratagene). Both bait and cDNA library were transformed intoS. cerevisiaestrain YRG-2 [MATaura3-52 his3-200 ade2-101 lys2-801 trp1-901 leu 2-3, 112 gal4-542 gal80-538 LYS2::UASGAL1-TATAGAL1-HIS3URA3::UASGAL4 17mers(x3)-TATACYC1-lacZ] (Stratagene). Approximately 1-2*106transformants were plated onto His-synthetic dextrose minimal medium and screened as described inSorrellNone. (2003)using both theHIS3andLacZreporter genes. Interacting proteins were identified by colony PCR and sequenced. Sequences were identified using the BLAST program (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/). TheAtWEE1ORF was amplified and cloned into the BiFC vector containing the C-terminal portion of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), pkanII-SPYCE(M) (WaadtNone., 2008) as described inLentz GronlundNone(2009). TheAtSKIP1ORF was PCR amplified (primers are listed inSupplementary Table S2atJXBonline) and cloned using theAscI/XmaI sites into the BiFC vector fusing theSKIP1ORF in-frame with the N-terminal portion of YFP, pSPYNE (WalterNone., 2004). The constructs were transformed intoA. tumefaciensstrainEHA105and used to co-transform transiently (as described inLentz GronlundNone, 2009) and transform stably BY-2 cells as described previously (OrchardNone., 2005). Cells were monitored for fluorescence using fluorescence microscopy (Olympus BH2, UV, lambda=420nm). AtWEE1under the 35S promoter in the BIN HYG TX vector was assembled as described inSpadaforaNone. (2012). A WEE1-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein construct was created by amplifying theAtWEE1ORF (using the primers listed inSupplementary Table S2atJXBonline) and cloned into the Gateway (Invitrogen) vector system to create an entry clone in pDonr207. The insert was then transferred to pGFP-N-Bin (Invitrogen) to create an N-terminal fusion. The constructs were transformed intoA. tumefaciensstrainLBA4404for transformation into BY-2 cells andA. tumefaciens GV3101for transformation intoArabidopsisvar. Columbia as described above. The presence of the transgene was checked by PCR (for primers, seeTable S2; data not shown). The 35S::GFP BY-2-transformed line was kindly donated by Dr Lukas Fischer (Nocarova and Fischer, 2009). Both cell lines were synchronized with aphidicolin (OrchardNone., 2005) and samples were stained with Hoechst. GFP and Hoechst were visualized using an Olympus BX61 microscope at lambda=380nm or 530nm. Where GFP signal was absent following Hoechst staining (35S::GFP line), further images were taken using differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy. Arabidopsislines expressing WEE1-GFP were selected based on GFP fluorescence visualized as above and crossed with a line expressing AtSUN1-mRFP (monomeric red fluorescent protein) (GraumannNone., 2010). Root tips of 5- to 7-day-old seedlings were imaged using an oil immersion *40 lens on a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope. GFP was excited with a 488nm argon laser and fluorescence was captured with a 505-530nm bandpass filter; mRFP was excited with a 543nm helium-neon laser and fluorescence was captured with a 560-615nm bandpass filter. Images were captured with the Zeiss LSM software and exported in TIF format. AtWEE1-GFP localization was observed using a Leica TCS SP2 AOBS spectral confocal microscope employing 5-day-old seedlings grown on MS medium (Murashige and Skoog, 1962). Cell walls were counterstained using propidium iodide. GFP fluorescence was excited using a 488nm argon ion laser line and detected between 500nm and 550nm. Propidium iodide fluorescence was excited using a 543nm helium-neon ion laser line and detected between 600nm and 650nm. Images were captured using Leica confocal software. The H2B-YFPArabidopsisline was kindly donated by Professor J. Murray, School of Biosciences, Cardiff University, Wales, UK. Five-day-old seedlings grown as above were carefully removed from the surface of the agar and incubated with MG132 [stock solution 25mg ml-1in dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) diluted to 50 uM in liquid MS medium or, for the mock treatment, an equal volume of DMSO instead of MG132 stock] and incubated with occasional gentle agitation in the light for 6h at 21 degrees C. Seedlings were then transferred to fresh liquid MS medium and used for confocal imaging as above. Fluorescence was quantified using ImageJ software. The WEE1 antibody recognized a single 56kDa band in proteins extracted in lag (day 1), exponential (day 3), and stationary phase (day 5) of a 7 day subculture of BY-2 cells, indicating good antibody specificity as shown previously withArabidopsis(Lentz Gronlund, 2009) (Supplementary Fig. S1atJXBonline). The CDK inhibitory activity of NtWEE1 was investigated using a WEE1 kinase inhibition assay based on that used with recombinantZ. maysandSolanum lycopersicumWEE1 proteins (SunNone., 1999;GonzalezNone., 2007). This assay tests whether recombinant NtWEE1 can inhibit CDK phosphorylation of histone H1in vitro. Total CDK activity in this assay is interpreted as the inverse of WEE1 activity, as previously demonstrated forHomo sapiensWee1 byMcGowan and Russell (1995). Induction of NtWEE1 inE. coliwas tested by western blotting, showing good specificity of the NtWEE1 antibody; purification of the recombinant WEE1 protein using His-beads resulted in a single band of the expected 56kDa on a Coomassie-stained gel (Supplementary Fig. S2atJXBonline). Addition of recombinant NtWEE1 resulted in a 5-fold decrease in CDK activity (Fig. 1A) compared with CDK alone. This shows that recombinant NtWEE1 protein produced inE. colican negatively regulate CDK activityin vitroas do other plant WEE1 kinases. This is taken to indicate that the WEE1 is inhibiting CDK activity through its kinase activity (seeSunNone., 1999). (A) Reduction in CDK activity elicited by the addition of recombinant NtWEE1. HIS6-NtWEE1 fusion protein, induced inE. coli(+IPTG) [compared with uninduced (-IPTG) control] was purified by affinity purification, and added to a kinase assay reaction containing CDKs (200 ug) purified from wild-typeN. tabacumBY-2 cell culture protein extracts using p13SUC1 beads and histone H1 substrate; compared with the CDK alone (100 or 200 ug). A representative autoradiograph is shown below the histogram. The incorporation of32P was assayed by quantification of the bands on the autoradiograph. (B-D) Cell cycle regulation of WEE1 mRNA, protein, and kinase activity in a synchronized wild-typeN. tabacumBY-2 cell culture following removal of aphidicolin. (B) Mitotic index profile (dotted line) calculated as the sum of prophase, anaphase, metaphase, and telophase mitotic figures as a percentage of a minimum of 300 cells; mean histone H4 expression level (% max +/-SE) (grey bars), meanNtWEE1expression level (% max +/-SE) (white bars), error bars absent when variation about the mean was less than 5% (n=3). The corresponding cell cycle phases are shown above the mitotic index graph. (C) Immunodetection of NtWEE1 protein extracted from synchrony samples (10 ug of protein per lane) and subjected to western blotting using the NtWEE1 antibody. The histogram displays mean (+/-SE) WEE1 protein levels as a ratio to an internal control (n=3). Representative western blot and a Coomassie stain loading control are shown below the histogram. (D) Inhibition of CDK activity by NtWEE1. The incorporation of32P into histone H1 was assayed by quantification of the bands on the autoradiographs and expressed as the percentage reduction in CDK activity (+/- SE). CDK was pulled-down from 100 ug of BY-2 proteins. A representative autoradiograph is shown below the histogram. Tobacco BY-2 cells were synchronized with aphidicolin and, following removal of this reversible inhibitor of DNA polymerase alpha (NagataNone., 1992), semi-quantitative RT-PCR generated histone H4 profiles showed an S-phase duration of 4h (Fig. 1B). Mitotic indices peaked at 9h (and also at 23h), giving a cell cycle duration of 14h (later part of the curve not shown). The phase durations (shown aboveFig. 1B) are highly comparable with previously published cell cycle data for BY-2 cells (seeNagataNone., 1992;SorrellNone., 2001;OrchardNone., 2005). Expression ofNtWEE1peaked at 4h (S/G2;Fig. 1B) and is also highly comparable with published data (GonzalezNone., 2004). WEE1 protein level was highest at 5h (early G2,Fig. 1C), 1h following theWEE1mRNA peak (Fig. 1B). WEE1 levels dropped significantly (P less than 0.05) at 7h (mid-G2) and remained low at 9h (mid-G2to mitosis) as more cells entered mitosis, before showing a slight rise at 11h (early G1) (Fig. 1C). WEE1 inhibition of CDK activity (Fig. 1D) was maximal when WEE1 was pulled-down from proteins extracted from BY-2 cells at 1h (early S-phase), decreased significantly (P less than 0.05) by 4h (S/G2) and again (P less than 0.05) from 4h to 6h (early G2), and then remained at this level throughout G2and M phase. The data are thus consistent in showing a drop in WEE1 kinase activity during G2that remained low when cells entered mitosis. Data for WEE1 protein and WEE1 inhibition of CDK activity suggest strongly that WEE1 is cell cycle regulated in BY-2 cells. However, neither total protein nor activity levels disappeared. Since only ~40% synchrony was achieved (Fig. 1B), residual WEE1 kinase activity may derive from incomplete shut down throughout mitosis or persisted because of unsynchronized interphase cells. To test more precisely the levels of WEE1 protein during the cell cycle, GFP signal was monitored during the synchronized cell cycle of a 35S::AtWEE1-GFP cell line compared with a 35S::GFP-expressing control line. The AtWEE1-GFP signal was detected mainly in nuclei and chromosomes, with background/residual GFP signal in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2A). In the AtWEE1-GFP line, GFP signal is greatly reduced in metaphase and early anaphase. (A) 35S::AtWEE1-GFP (GFP, Hoechst, and merged GFP-Hoechst; Hoechst lambda=420nm GFP lambda=530nm). Yellow arrows indicate a representative cell; scale bar=50 um for all images. (B) Nuclear fluorescence frequency (%) of cells sampled from the synchronized 35S::AtWEE1-GFP cell line. nvalues are indicated on each bar. Contingency chi2=1511 df 4,P less than 0.001. A clear nuclear AtWEE1-GFP signal was seen in interphase; however, signal associated with the chromosomes of early and late prophase cells was weaker, followed by an almost complete absence of signal from chromosomes at metaphase and early anaphase but its re-establishment in late anaphase and telophase. This pattern of alteration of AtWEE1-GFP intensity contrasts with a constant GFP signal regardless of cell cycle stage for the 35S::GFP line (Supplementary Fig. S3atJXBonline). Quantification of nuclear fluorescence from greater than 1500 cells in both lines confirmed that in the 35S::AtWEE1-GFP line, GFP signal was undetectable in metaphase cells and only very few prophase cells emitted signal (Fig. 2B). A contingency chi2indicated a highly significant difference in the relative frequency of fluorescence between stages for the 35S::AtWEE1-GFP line. In contrast, in the 35S::GFP line all cells (interphase and all mitotic stages) emitted a GFP signal and hence would be quantified as 100% were it to be shown inFig. 2B. The dispersal of AtWEE1 during metaphase was also confirmed inArabidopsisroots. AnArabidopsisline transformed with the WEE1-GFP construct was crossed with a line transformed with the nuclear envelope marker, AtSUN1-mRFP (GraumannNone., 2010;Graumann and Evans, 2011). In the resultant line, the pattern of WEE1-GFP signal during the cell cycle is similar to that seen in BY-2 cells (Fig. 3). In interphase, a clear nucleoplasmic AtWEE1-GFP signal is visible, surrounded by nuclear envelope labelling of AtSUN1-mRFP (Fig. 3). During metaphase AtWEE1-GFP signal is essentially absent but a clear AtSUN1-mRFP signal can be observed in mitotic spindle membranes (Fig. 3). AtWEE1-GFP signal reappears in late anaphase/early telophase cells, while AtSUN1-mRFP is present in the reforming nuclear envelope, and, finally, strong GFP and RFP signals were observed during cytokinesis. Hence, there is a remarkably precise cell cycle regulation of WEE1 with presumed degradation or destabilization of WEE1 when chromosomes align at the metaphase plate for both BY-2 cells andArabidopsisroot cells. AtWEE1-GFP and AtSUN1-mRFP expression in different cell cycle phases in roots of transgenicArabidopsisexpressing both genes. Green colouring indicates AtWEE1-GFP expression, while purple colouring indicates AtSUN1-mRFP expression. Scale bar=10 um. Yellow arrows indicate a representative cell. The stability of WEE1 protein was also examined in lateral roots of two independent 35S::AtWEE1-GFP-expressingArabidopsislines, #10 and #67. In line #10, a weak GFP signal was observed in the nuclei of the basal cells of the lateral root primordia (Fig. 4A), but fluorescence was not detected in the rest of the primordium. In line #67, a fluorescent signal could not be detected in any of the cells of the lateral root primordia (Fig. 4B). In contrast, in the 35S::H2B-YFP line, strong YFP expression was observed throughout the lateral root primordia (Fig. 4C). Lateral root primordia of AtWEE1-GFP lines #10 and #67, and H2B-YFP seedlings. (A and B) Green colouring indicates AtWEE1-GFP expression in two independent lines, #10 and #67.

P, lateral root primordium; BC, basal cells of lateral root primordium. Note that the middle image of (A) is a primordium seen from above, and demarcated by propidium iodide counterstaining. The proteasome inhibitor MG132 was used to determine whether the reduced fluorescent signal observed in the AtWEE1-GFP lines was caused by proteasome-mediated protein degradation. GFP signal clearly increased in AtWEE1-GFP seedlings treated with MG132 relative to the mock-treated seedlings (Fig. 5A) both in the root tips and further up the root. Quantification of the fluorescent signal showed that there was a significant (P less than 0.05) 2-fold increase in GFP signal in the MG132-treated seedlings compared with the mock-treated seedlings (Fig. 5B). This demonstrates that the AtWEE1-GFP protein persists when the degradation route via the 26S proteasome is blocked. MG132- and mock-treated 5-day-old AtWEE1-GFP line # 67 seedlings.

To allow for accurate and direct comparison between the two treatments, the confocal settings were not altered between the imaging of the MG132-treated and mock-treated seedlings. (B) GFP signal intensity (+/-SE). *Significant difference between treatments (P less than 0.05;n= =466 to =2121). AtWEE1 was used as a bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen to search for interacting proteins that might play a regulatory role in its turnover. Approximately 1*107transformants were screened from a library generated usingArabidopsisprimary and secondary root tips (SorrellNone., 2003). Over 900 interactors were detected by an ability to grow on His-medium and, in a second screen for beta-galactosidase activity, 82 of these were confirmed. Sequencing of plasmid insertions revealed 60 different AtWEE1 interaction partners, of which 11 were identified multiple times (Supplementary Table S1atJXBonline). Functionally the interacting proteins could be divided into seven groups (Table 1). Of direct relevance to this work, four proteins associated with ubiquitin-mediated degradation were detected (Supplementary Table S1); each one was only detected once. One of these is a regulatory subunit of the 26S proteasome, while the other three are F-box proteins including SKIP1 (SKP1 INTERACTING PARTNER 1). Functional groups of proteins that interacted with AtWEE1 in a yeast two-hybrid library screenBiFC in BY-2 cells was used to verify the AtSKIP1-AtWEE1 interaction in plant cells, initially by transient transformation. Interacting proteins were mostly localized in the nucleus; however, the interaction was also detected at the cell wall, especially at the junctions between adjacent cells (Fig. 6A). The AtWEE1-YFPC(in the SPYCE vector) and AtSKIP1-YFPN(in the SPYNE vector) constructs were stably co-transformed into BY-2 cells to study the dynamics of the interaction during the cell cycle. The frequency with which an interaction between AtWEE1 and AtSKIP1 was observed in each cell cycle phase was similar to that of AtWEE1-GFP, with a drop in interactions observed between interphase and prophase, and interactions were not observed during metaphase. Interactions were again observed during anaphase and telophase (Fig. 6B). (A) Tobacco BY-2 cells co-transformed with (i) AtWEE1-YFPCin the vector pSPYCE and AtSKIP1-YFPNin the vector pSPYNE; (ii) AtBZIP63 in both pSPYCE and pSPYNE (positive control); and (iii) AtWEE1-YFPCand AtBZIP63-YFPN(negative control); under UV light (left), white light (right), and the two merged (centre). Blue colouring indicates a positive interaction between the two proteins (representative images). (B) Mean nuclear fluorescence frequency (%; +/-SE,n=3) in each cell cycle phase in cells from the following transgenic BY-2 lines: AtWEE1-GFP line # 4 (GFP-WEE1) and AtWEE1-YFPC/AtSKIP1-YFPN, line # 6 (WEE1-C/SKIP1-N6). Given an interaction between AtWEE1 and AtSKIP1, the extent to which these genes affected aphidicolin-induced synchronized cell cycles in BY-2 cells was examined. Expression ofAtWEE1-YFPCresulted in a mitotic peak at 7h compared with 9h in wild-type BY-2 cells (Fig. 7A,B). The mitotic peak was also earlier (at 4h) whenAtWEE1was expressed in BY-2 cells in the BIN HYG TX vector under an attenuated 35S promoter (Supplementary Fig. S4atJXBonline). However, whenAtSKIP1-YFPNwas co-expressed withAtWEE1-YFPC, there was an interaction between the two proteins, and the mitotic peak was restored to wild-type timing of 9h (Fig. 7C).

The timing of the first mitotic peak in each line is shown with an arrow. In the work reported here, the inhibitory effect of the WEE1 protein pulled-down from BY-2 cells on CDK activity drops as cells traverse G2and enter mitosis. Remarkably, a GFP signal essentially disappeared at metaphase in both BY-2 cells andArabidopsislines expressingWEE1-GFP. The GFP signal was then restored towards the end of mitosis at late anaphase/early telophase. Previous work inArabidopisand tobacco BY-2 cells established that the G2/M transition is regulated by both CDKA and CDKB. While CDKA activity is generally constant during S-phase and G2, CDKB peaks in mid- to late G2phase (PorcedduNone., 2001;SorrellNone., 2001;OrchardNone., 2005). In other words, WEE1 activity data are the opposite of the typical CDKB activity profile reported for BY-2 cells (SorrellNone., 2001;OrchardNone., 2005). Such CDK activity is required until metaphase when partner mitotic cyclins are degraded via a proteolytic pathway that deploys the anaphase-promoting complex (APC-Cdh1;Peters, 2002). BY-2 cells transformed with non-degradable mitotic B1 cyclin exhibited normal prophase and metaphase, but from there on was a mitotic catastrophe (WeingartnerNone., 2004). In other words, a normal mitosis is finely tuned and depends on CDK kinase activity persisting until metaphase but then finishing abruptly. Another notable feature of the profile reported here is that NtWEE1 kinase-mediated inhibition of CDK activity is highest in early S-phase. Recently, it was shown inArabidopsisthat following hydroxyurea treatment, roots exhibited rapid accumulation ofWEE1transcripts at the start of S-phase, leading to the suggestion that WEE1 kinase has a role during S-phase following the induction of the DNA replication checkpoint (CoolsNone., 2011). Thus data here support a role for plant WEE1 in S-phase although, of course, it is still possible that there may also be other negative regulators of CDK activity in thein vivoplant cell cycle (e.g. ICK1/2), as proposed byBoudolfNone. (2006). Unlike WEE1 kinase in the human cell cycle (McGowan and Russell, 1995), NtWEE1 activity never drops to zero. While the use of aphidicolin is an established and proven method for cell cycle synchrony (NagataNone., 1992), it is not possible to achieve 100% synchronization of mitosis. Hence the residual protein and kinase activity is most probably due to WEE1 protein in interphase cells. Furthermore, BY-2 andArabidopsislines expressing AtWEE1-GFP exhibited WEE1 protein localization in mitotic phases other than metaphase. This is another reason why WEE1 kinase activity did not drop to zero during mitosis in synchronized BY-2 cells. The 35S promoter normally confers strong, constitutive expression in BY-2 andArabidopsisroot tip cells. So the dramatic reduction of GFP signal in metaphase cells in both BY-2 andArabidopsisroot cells expressingWEE1is consistent with the removal of the WEE1 protein at this stage of mitosis. In the 35S::GFP control BY-2 cells, GFP signal persisted in 100% of cells, regardless of mitotic phase. A previous study of the interactions between rice cyclins and CDKs in BY-2 cells showed that there was a tight association of CDKB2;1-GFP and CycB2;2-GFP with chromosomes of transgenic BY-2 cells during an aphidicolin-induced synchronous cell cycle (LeeNone., 2003). This conclusion was supported by the finding that treatment with Triton X-100 resulted in a complete loss of GFP fluorescence in cells expressing GFP alone whereas GFP fluorescence was unaffected by the Triton treatment in the lines transformed with the CDK-GFP or cyclin-GFP fusion proteins. Exactly the same phenomenon was seen here when the GFP-expressing line was stained with Hoechst; this staining reaction depends on a pre-treatment with Triton X-100. Hence, in the 35S::AtWEE1-GFP line, the data suggest that the loss of GFP signal is due to WEE1 degradation at metaphase and its re-appearance due to re-synthesis at anaphase. Moreover the same pattern of alteration of GFP signal was seen in root meristems of 35S::AtWEE1-GFP crossed with AtSUN1-RFP. The pattern of 35S::AtWEE1-GFP signal was also examined in lateral root primordia in two independentArabidopsislines. AtWEE1-GFP levels were reduced in both lines, to the point of being undetectable in line #67, whereas 35S::H2B-YFP was strongly and constitutively expressed in the lateral root primordia (Boisnard-LorigNone., 2001). This implies a high turnover of AtWEE1 in lateral root primordia, supporting a role for AtWEE1 degradation in the initiation of lateral root growth. This is further supported by the down-regulation ofAtWEE1in the pericycle, when roots were stimulated to produce laterals by 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) treatment (de Almeida EnglerNone, 2009). Since pericycle cells re-enter the cell cycle for the initiation of laterals, this supports a role for inhibition of the cell cycle via WEE1 and its removal in pericycle cells primed to divide. Timely degradation of plant cell cycle proteins, including cyclins, is frequently achieved via the 26S proteasome degradation pathway (GenschikNone., 1998). WEE1 degradation is also achieved via the 26S proteasome degradation pathway in budding yeast (Simpson-Lavy and Brandeis, 2010),Xenopus(Michael and Newport, 1998), and humans (WatanabeNone., 2004). However, the mechanism for the degradation of WEE1 protein in plants is yet to be described. When a 26S proteasome inhibitor, MG132 (RockNone., 1994), was supplied to seedlings of an AtWEE1-GFP-expressing line, the AtWEE1-GFP signal was significantly enhanced (Fig. 5A,B). These results strongly indicate that AtWEE1 protein is degraded via the 26S proteasome degradation pathway; note that GFP is unaffected by MG132 treatment (Song and Wu, 2005). The finding that AtWEE1 interacts with several proteasome-related proteins in a two-hybrid screen further supports this route for its degradation. BiFC was used to confirm the interaction between AtWEE1 and the F-box protein AtSKIP1. AtSKIP1 interacts with the SKP1/ASK1 subunit of SCF ubiquitin ligase (RisseeuwNone., 2003). It is not closely related to any other proteins inArabidopsis; the closest homologue is a member of the RNI-superfamily, theArabidopsisputative F-box/leucine-rich repeat protein 19 (At4g30640), which shares 40% gene sequence identity withAtSKIP1. This interaction could provide the specificity for the targeted removal of AtWEE1, although the finding that AtWEE1 interacts with several F-box proteins indicates that different F-box proteins may mediate the specificity of WEE1 removal in different tissues or under different cellular conditions. If AtSKIP1 promotes AtWEE1 degradation, then co-expression of the two proteins might tend to destabilize the AtWEE1. This hypothesis was tested using synchronized BY-2 cells. Expressing AtWEE1 in tobacco BY-2 cells under the 35S promoter led to a shortening of G2and a premature rise in the mitotic peak, as was the case in theAtWEE1-YFPCline. This was an unexpected result since expression ofAtWEE1in fission yeast (SorrellNone., 2002) andArabidopsis(SpadaforaNone., 2012) tends to delay mitosis, resulting in a larger cell phenotype. This result is probably due to an interaction betweenAtWEE1and the tobacco cellular machinery resulting in an interference in the normal functions of NtWEE1. However, co-expression ofAtSKIP1-YFPNwithAtWEE1-YFPCclearly delayed the mitotic peak compared withAtWEE1-YFPCalone, restoring the timing back to the wild type. This suggests that the removal of AtWEE1 by SKIP1 prevented a premature rise in the mitotic index in synchronized cells. Thus the hypothesis that the interaction between AtWEE1 and AtSKIP1 is indeed functional was supported. In conclusion, a drop in WEE1 activity was discovered when synchronized BY-2 cells traverse G2and enter mitosis. This is linked to a fine-tuned regulation of WEE1 protein, which essentially disappeared from chromosomes at metaphase in both BY-2 cells andArabidopsisroots. Given what is known about CDK activity at G2/M and during mitosis, this suggests an inverse relationship between WEE1 and CDKB activity in the normal BY-2 cell cycle. The removal of WEE1 protein from lateral root primordial cells also supports the idea that WEE1 is degraded, enabling cell division in the pericyle and in developing lateral root primordia. Furthermore, the data here demonstrate for the first time that WEE1 protein is degraded via the 26S proteasome in plants, and that this may be mediated by an interaction with specific F-box proteins including SKIP1.
