Genetic diversity and population structures are relevant for understanding the evolutionary history, breeding systems, geographical distributions and ecological requirements of species. In evolutionary studies, molecular markers that differentiate close species and their putative hybrids greatly increase our understanding of the genetic basis of speciation and the effects of introgression on species integrity. ThePetuniagenus encompasses 14 taxonomically accepted wild species, which are distributed exclusively in southern South America (StehmannNone. 2009) and present low genetic variability (AndoNone. 2005;KulcheskiNone. 2006;Lorenz-LemkeNone. 2010;FregoneziNone. 2013), and one artificial hybrid known worldwide, the commercialPetunia hybridathat is the result of crossings betweenPetunia axillarisandPetunia interior(SegattoNone. 2014None). Moreover, species of this genus are commonly used as a scientific model species because of their intrinsic features (Gerats and Vandenbussche 2005). Petunia axillarisis the only species of the genus that presents white corollas (StehmannNone. 2009) and is pollinated by hawkmoths (AndoNone. 1995;VenailNone. 2010;KlahreNone. 2011) (Fig. 1). This species is widespread in the Pampas grasslands of southern South America and currently consists of three taxonomically accepted subspecies:P. axillarisssp. axillaris,P. axillarisssp. parodiiandP. axillarisssp. subandina. These subspecies are morphologically distinguishable from each other by floral traits such as corolla tube length, relative positioning of the stamen and corolla, and corolla diameter (Ando 1996;TurchettoNone. 2014None,None) (Fig. 1). Plastid data analysis revealed low genetic differentiation among these subspecies, whereas the nuclear genome contained greater genetic variability (TurchettoNone. 2014None,None). The three subspecies occur in adjacent geographic regions, and theP. axillarisssp. axillariscould be found in the same narrow region as another congeneric species,Petunia exserta, that presents red and bird-pollinated flowers (Lorenz-LemkeNone. 2006;StehmannNone. 2009;SegattoNone. 2014None) (Fig. 1). Although they grow in sympatry,P. exsertaandP. axillarisssp. axillarisare partially isolated in adjacent microhabitats: whereasP. exsertaplants grow only inside the shaded cracks (shelters) of sandstone towers where they are protected from direct rain and sunlight,P. axillarisssp. axillarisindividuals grow in open and sunny habitats (Fig. 1). NoneNoneNoneMorphologies and habitats of the taxa studied.

Previous studies addressing the genetic diversity of these species showed lower indices of genetic variability inP. exserta, in agreement with its narrow endemic status (SegattoNone. 2014None), and extensive divergence between the species. Moreover, natural hybridization between these species has been suggested based on their morphology as well as plastid and nuclear genomes data (Lorenz-LemkeNone. 2006;SegattoNone. 2014None). Although the genetic diversity and population structure of these taxa have been previously addressed (Lorenz-LemkeNone. 2006;SegattoNone. 2014None;TurchettoNone. 2014None,None), here we provide a new approach and obtain more precise taxa characterization by using microsatellites derived from expressed sequence tag-simple sequence repeat (EST-SSR) markers. BossoliniNone. (2011)developed, mapped and used 83 EST-SSRs to construct linkage maps inPetuniaand these markers cover the seven chromosomes ofPetunia. However, despite their great potential for evolutionary studies, the markers have not been used to access the genetic variability in wildPetuniaspecies. Expressed sequence tag-simple sequence repeat markers offer advantages over genomic DNA-based markers: they can be applied to analyse the functional diversity; are more conserved among species; and are obtained from gene-rich regions of genome (ZhangNone. 2005;GuoNone. 2006). They can also be used efficiently to assess genetic relationships (Gupta and Rustgi 2004) and to compare closely related taxa (FluchNone. 2011). The main goals of this work were to evaluate genetic polymorphism in a subset of thePetuniaEST-SSRs in wildP. axillarissubspecies andP. exserta, thereby identifying alleles private to each taxon and to employ these genetic profiles to detect putative natural hybrids. We collected young leaves of individuals from the three natural occurringP. axillarissubspecies andP. exserta. The young leaves were dried in silica gel and pulverized in liquid nitrogen to allow genomic DNA extraction with cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) (RoyNone. 1992). Additionally, we included genomic DNA from the previously analysed natural hybrids (P. axillarisssp. axillaris*P. exserta;Lorenz-LemkeNone. 2006) in our analyses (Table 1). The quality and quantity of the isolated DNA was estimated by measuring the absorbance at 260 and 280 nm on a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop 1000 spectrometer, Thermo Scientific Corp., San Jose, CA, USA). The DNA was finally electrophoresed on a 1.0 % agarose gel using GelRedTM (Biotium, Inc., Hayward, CA, USA). Samples were stored until further study at -20 degrees C.NoneNoneNoneOrigin of thePetuniaindividuals analysed in this study.

The genomic DNA of each individual was used to amplify the previously characterized EST-SSR markers (BossoliniNone. 2011; available online athttp://www.botany.unibe.ch/deve/caps/index.html) scattered throughout the genome. Initially, we selected 34 primers based on their chromosomal location and polymorphic index content to test the cross-transferability among taxa and putative hybrids. Only 14 were successfully amplified and were subsequently used to estimate genetic variability. Polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) were conducted in a final volume of 10 muL containing ?10 ng of genomic DNA as a template, 200 muM of each dNTP (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 1.7 pmol of fluorescently labelled M13(-21) primer, 3.5 pmol of reverse primer, 0.35 pmol of forward primer with a 5'-M13(-21) tail, 2.0 mM MgCl2(Invitrogen), 0.5 U of Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) and 1* Platinum Taq reaction buffer (Invitrogen). The PCR conditions were as follows: an initial denaturation at 96 degrees C for 3 min; 32 cycles of 96 degrees C for 15 s, 50-52 degrees C for 30 s and 72 degrees C for 1 min; and a final extension cycle at 72 degrees C for 7 min. The forward primers were FAM-, NED-, or HEX-labelled. The amplified product was visualized on a 2 % ultra-resolution agarose gel stained with 2 muL 0.001 % of GelRed (Biotium Inc.). The DNA fragments were denatured and size-fractionated using capillary electrophoresis on a MegaBACE 1000 automated sequencer (GE Healthcare Biosciences, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) with an ET-ROX 550 internal size ladder (GE Healthcare). The manufacturer's software was used to identify the alleles. The primer sequences, repeat motif, fragment size range as estimated by the number of base pairs, and respective annealing temperatures are shown inNone. We used the FSTAT 2.9.3.2 software (Goudet 1995) to evaluate summary statistics such as the number of alleles per locus (A), gene diversity, allelic richness (RA) and number of private alleles (E) per locus. We estimated the frequencies of null alleles and the polymorphic information content using the CERVUS 3.0.3 software (MarshallNone. 1998;KalinowskiNone. 2007). The tests for outlier loci were performed with the BAYESCAN 2.1 software (Foll and Gaggiotti 2008) based on the multinomial-Dirichlet model. The BAYESCAN software incorporates the uncertainty of allele frequencies due to small sample sizes. Selection was introduced by decomposing the locus-populationFSTcoefficients into a population-specific component (beta) shared by all loci and a locus-specific component (alpha) shared by all populations using a logistic regression approach. Selection is assumed to occur when the alpha component is necessary to explain the diversity observed at a locus. To investigate the genetic similarity between taxa, we carried out a principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) using the GENALEX 6.4 software (Peakall and Smouse 2006,2012). We used a distance matrix based on the alleles that were shared among individuals to depict the relationships among individuals in all taxa; the original data were bootstrapped 1000 times using the MICROSAT software (MinchNone. 1997). In addition, an unweighted neighbour-joining (NJ) tree (Saitou and Nei 1987) was constructed based on the mean bootstrapped matrix of microsatellite alleles shared among the 126 individuals calculated from 14 EST-SSRs using the MEGA6 software (TamuraNone. 2013). We amplified and analysed 13 putative hybrid individuals from a contact zone betweenP. axillarisssp. axillarisandP. exsertathat presented intermediate morphological characters, such as corolla colour, reproductive organs size and relative position, as previously described (Table 1) (Lorenz-LemkeNone. 2006). We conducted a discriminant analysis of principal components (JombartNone. 2010) using the R package ADEGENET (Jombart 2008;R Development Core Team 2011) among the threeP. axillarissubspecies,P. exserta, and the putative hybrids to identify and describe clusters of genetically related individuals. Discriminant analysis of principal components is better suited than STRUCTURE analysis (PritchardNone. 2000) to unravel the underlying genetic structure in complex groups that are not necessarily populations (JombartNone. 2010). Discriminant analysis of principal components is not based on pre-defined population genetics models and makes no assumptions about Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium or linkage disequilibrium. We set ana priorigroup number of five in the DAPC analysis. We used a factorial correspondence analysis (FCA) as performed in GENETIX version 4.05 (BelkhirNone. 2004) to plot multilocus genotypes and visualize species discreteness based on the most distinctive loci. In this analysis, each row (individuals) and each column (alleles) were depicted as a point. The hyperspace had as many dimensions as there were alleles for each locus, and the algorithm attempted to find independent directions in this hyperspace. We also ran a clustering analysis, as implemented in the STRUCTURE 2.3 software (PritchardNone. 2000), to compare with the DAPC results. The parameters were correlated allele frequencies (FalushNone. 2003) and no prior population information was used. The number of groups (K) was evaluated from 1 to 10, with 10 independent runs perKvalue, to determine the maximum value of the posterior likelihood [lnP(D)] and the best value ofK. Each run was performed using 2.5 * 105burn-in periods and 106Markov chain Monte Carlo repetitions after burn-in, and the convergence was assessed. The optimal value ofKwas calculated using the maximum value of DeltaK(EvannoNone. 2005). We used the CLUMPP 1.1.2 software to summarize the results of the optimalKvalue based on the average pairwise similarity of individual assignments across runs using Greedy's method and theG' statistic (Jakobsson and Rosenberg 2007). We used the DISTRUCT 1.1 software (Rosenberg 2004) to visualize the STRUCTURE results after processing with the CLUMPP software. Substructures within each main cluster were detected by the same approach using STRUCTURE. Fourteen of the 34 previously described loci reached our criteria for markers that had the potential to discriminate among the four wildPetuniataxa and their putative interspecific hybrids. The 14 EST-SSR loci revealed 143 alleles in 126 sampled individuals (Table 2). Petunia axillarisssp. axillarispresented the highest diversity index, whereasP. axillarisssp. subandinawas the least diverse (Tables 2and3). The combined probability of identity for the 14 EST-SSR loci was almost zero for all taxa, which indicated that two unrelated individuals would not share the same multilocus genotype. The PIC values (Table 3) ranged from 0.42 (PM184) to 0.93 (PM177), which showed that these markers are polymorphic across taxa. We found private alleles in all taxa, with a higher value forP. axillarisssp. axillaris(22 alleles), followed byP. exsertaandP. axillarisssp. parodii(nine alleles each) andP. axillarisssp. subandina(seven alleles). The majority of the private alleles found inP. exsertaorP. axillarisssp. axillariswas present in their putative hybrids. In total, 12 private alleles were shared betweenP. axillarisssp. axillaris(eight alleles) orP. exserta(four alleles) and their hybrids[seeNoneNone]. Moreover, hybrid individuals shared one private allele found inP. axillarisssp. subandina,which grows far ?1000 km. The PM21 and PM88 loci presented two and one private alleles in the putative hybrids, respectively, which suggests that these alleles came from parental plants that were not sampled in our study[seeNoneNone].

The number of private alleles shared between taxa and hybrids individuals was presented in parenthesis. The frequency of null alleles varied from 20 to 79 % across all taxa. Null alleles were present at high frequency ( greater than 5 %) in all taxa. The tests for outlier loci among all 126 individuals revealed that PM177 (P= 1), PM88 (P= 0.829), PM74 (P= 0.983) and PM192 (P= 1) were under selection with negative alpha values, which suggests the occurrence of a balancing or purifying selection. However, this result should be considered carefully because we did not sample a representative population. Principal coordinates analysis (Fig. 2) was conducted to assess the clustering of individuals based on EST-SSR polymorphisms. Plotting the first two axes showed thatP. axillarisssp. axillarisandP. exsertawere closely related in the coordinate space and thatP. axillarisssp. parodiiformed a wider scattered group, whereas the other two subspecies each formed only one exclusive group. The NJ tree (Fig. 3) of the 126 individuals obtained from a matrix of shared microsatellite alleles presented two major clusters: the first groupedP. axillarisssp. axillarisandP. exsertaindividuals (Group A); whereas individuals ofP. axillarisssp. parodiiandP. axillarisssp. subandinapreferentially composed the second group (Group B). Group A was divided into two subgroups, one corresponding toP. exsertaindividuals and only two individuals ofP. axillarisssp. axillarisand another composed of only individuals of theP. axillarisssp. axillaris. SomeP. axillarisssp. axillarisandP. exsertaindividuals clustered with Group B (Fig. 3).

The polymorphism of these 14 EST-SSR loci indicated that putative hybrid individuals with a morphology betweenP. axillarisssp. axillarisandP. exsertapresented similar genetic profiles to those observed for morphologically typicalP. exsertaorP. axillarisssp. axillarisindividuals (Fig. 4). In the DAPC (Fig. 4A) morphological hybrids grouped more closely toP. exsertaindividuals. TypicalP. exsertaindividuals were more close related toP. axillarisssp. axillaristhan to the otherP. axillarissubspecies. In the FCA (Fig. 4B) the proximity ofP. axillarisssp. axillarisandP. exsertawas more apparent, and the hybrids were placed within the distribution of these taxa. This analysis considers the entire allele to be a representation of one individual for plotting in the hyperspace. The STRUCTURE analysis (Fig. 4C) confirmed these results. In STRUCTURE analysis, the bestK= 4 was obtained by Evanno's method with the inclusion of putative hybrids in theP. exsertagroup, and the other clusters were associated with theP. axillarissubspecies.

In general, EST-SSRs have been found to be significantly more transferable across taxonomic boundaries compared with the traditional 'anonymous' SSRs (Tiffin and Hahn 2002;VarshneyNone. 2005;WoodheadNone. 2005). In the present study, we aimed to evaluate a set of microsatellite markers developed from EST-SSRs to obtain information about their cross-transferability in different wildPetuniaspecies. We intended to identify markers that can be used in population dynamic analyses, breeding systems and interspecific hybridization events. Here, we successfully cross-amplified 14 EST-SSR loci and estimated the genetic differentiation of close related wildPetuniataxa (theP. axillarissubspecies andP. exserta). These loci were obtained from an EST database with sequences that were isolated preferentially from the roots and floral organs ofPetunia hybrida(BossoliniNone. 2011). Overall,P. axillarisssp. axillarishad a higher number of alleles per locus and allelic richness (Tables 2and3), which illustrated the high diversity of this taxon. This is consistent with the findings of previous studies of plastid sequences, cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) nuclear markers (SegattoNone. 2014None;TurchettoNone. 2014None), and the phylogenetic position of these taxa (Reck-KortmannNone. 2014). The mean number of alleles per locus obtained using EST-SSRs in these species (10 for a complete data set) was higher than that obtained inPetunia integrifoliabased on genomic SSRs (a mean of three alleles per locus;KriedtNone. 2011). A recent study involving wildPetuniaspecies and commercialP. hybrida(SegattoNone. 2014None) showed thatP. integrifoliaspecies complex share several alleles and also have a low mean number of alleles per locus (five inPetunia inflata, four inP. integrifoliaand three inPetunia interior). Here, we found that all taxa contained private alleles, which indicated that EST-SSR loci are a useful tool for evolutionary analyses of these species. The morphological and ecological differentiation betweenP. axillarisandP. exsertais clear, and although they share plastid haplotypes, there is no doubt about the placement of these lineages at the species level (SegattoNone. 2014None). We included samples from different locations to represent the entire geographic distribution of all taxa and to minimize the population effect (population inferences were not included here). Flower morphology affects the behaviour of pollinators by advertising for reward and restricting access. The maintenance of morphological traits is responsible for preserving the genetic boundaries between species, although past hybridization events could have occurred. The individuals mentioned in this study presenting an intermediate morphology were considered to be interspecific hybrids due to their morphological traits-especially the corolla colour and position of reproductive organs, plastid polymorphism and positional distribution inside caves. These individuals had been analysed previously and were considered hybrids betweenP. exsertaandP. axillaris(Lorenz-LemkeNone. 2006). The putative hybrids presented alleles that were private toP. axillarisssp. axillarisorP. exserta(Table 3), thereby highlighting the ability of these markers to identify hybridization events between these species. However, only one marker private toP. axillarisssp. axillarisandP. exsertawas shared between hybrid individuals (PM188;None). These results provide evidence that the putative hybrids evaluated may not be F1 hybrids and could have backcrossed with the parental species or crossed among themselves. Studies analysing the morphology of individuals, in addition to canonical morphological data coupled with analysis of these markers, can be useful for understanding the evolution of these closely related wild species. In the STRUCTURE analysis (Fig. 4), putative hybrids showed signs of admixture withP. axillarisssp. axillaris, but the same level of admixture has been found in theP. exsertagroup. This pattern could be explained by backcrossing with parental species or by shared ancestral polymorphisms. Moreover, the putative morphological hybrids occurred only inside caves (P. exsertahabitat) and it is possible that the hybrids have habitat or ecological restrictions. Another more controversial possibility is that speciation with gene flow occurred, and some of the morphological traits were not uniform as demonstrated to other species (Wu 2001). The consequences of hybridization differ depending on whether the species diverged with gene flow or underwent a secondary contact (AbbottNone. 2013). These EST-SSRs enable the unravelling of these evolutionary processes in future population studies. InP. axillaris, the maintenance of morphological traits is responsible for preserving the boundaries of the subspecies. The clear ecological and morphological differentiation of theP. axillarissubspecies is primarily associated with corolla tube length (TurchettoNone. 2014None,None), and differences in tube length raise interesting questions about the feeding strategy of pollinators. Under controlled greenhouse conditions,Manduca sextamoths preferP. axillarisflowers with a larger limb size, which may simply reflect its better visibility under low light conditions (VenailNone. 2010). Moreover, tube length is associated with a CAPS marker derived from theFlavonoid hydroxylase1 (HF1) gene, and the differences betweenP. axillarissubspecies are associated with different genotypes at this locus (TurchettoNone. 2014None). TheHF1gene is also informative for distinguishingPetuniaspecies (ChenNone. 2007). Further experiments, particularly considering morphological traits under field conditions, are necessary to evaluate the remaining questions involvingP. axillarisandP. exsertaand their pollinators; highly polymorphic EST-SSRs will be informative in these studies. The close relationship betweenP. axillarisssp. axillarisandP. exserta(KulcheskiNone. 2006;Lorenz-LemkeNone. 2006;Reck-KortmannNone. 2014;SegattoNone. 2014None) was confirmed and supported by this study. Moreover, the EST-SSRs used were able to differentiate taxa. Our results suggest that these EST-SSR markers may constitute a useful tool for evolutionary and ecological studies involving these species. The original description of these EST-SSRs (BossoliniNone. 2011) used very fewPetuniaindividuals that had been maintained in a greenhouse for decades. Here, we demonstrated that these markers may cross-amplify wild individuals and are able to differentiate species through private alleles in each species or even by combined genotypes. Evolutionary studies require many universal primers that can be used in multiple species and that allow comparisons between close related taxa to address questions of population divergence and speciation processes (Noor and Feder 2006). Expressed sequence tag-simple sequence repeats are easily transferable across species (LiewlaksaneeyanawinNone. 2003;ChapmanNone2009) and may be a useful tool in evolutionary studies, especially of genera such asPetunia, with low genetic diversity and great morphological variability (FregoneziNone. 2013). The EST-SSR markers analysed inPicea abies(FluchNone. 2011) presented a high degree of variability and were well suited for an analysis of the stress-related functional variation present in this species. Although EST-SSRs are related to transcribed regions, they can evolve neutrally. In fact, several studies have found that the population structure measures of EST-SSRs are very similar to those derived from anonymous SSRs (e.g. WoodheadNone. 2005). Moreover, this type of molecular marker has been used for hybrid identification, population genetics studies, distinguishing close related taxa and studying functional genetic diversity (NareshNone. 2009;ChapmanNone. 2010;Barati and Arzani 2012;LiNone. 2013;YangNone. 2013). Expressed sequence tag-simple sequence repeat polymorphisms are associated with transcribed regions of the genome and reflect the genetic diversity inside or adjacent to genes (ClarkNone. 2003). The major criticism regarding the use of these markers to estimate population parameters is that divergent selection would increase the differentiation among and reduce variability within populations, whereas balancing selection could produce the opposite effect. ChagneNone. (2004)showed that estimates of population differentiation based on EST-SSRs are comparable with those based on anonymous SSRs or large-scale comparative analyses. Moreover, only a very small percentage of genes experiencing positive selection has been identified (LiNone. 2013;YangNone. 2013). Thus, one should expect that only a small fraction of EST-SSRs would be subject to selection. In this study, only four loci were found to be under selective pressure. Two of them are of unknown function (PM177 and PM88), while PM192 and PM74 are located in transcription factors[seeNoneNone]. More analyses, including population studies of each taxon, may clarify the role of these markers in functional differentiation. The effects of morphological differences on the feeding strategy of the pollinators and adaptive genetic differentiation to maintain the processes of speciation involving close related species with the ability to hybridize in nature raise interesting questions, andPetuniaspecies are an excellent model for this area of study. Further experiments, especially analyses of morphology, gene flow and crossbreeding systems, are necessary to answer the remaining evolutionary questions about thePetuniaspecies and speciation processes within this genus. Understanding the processes involved in the diversification and speciation of wildPetuniaspecies is not only important for ecological and environmental issues but may also be useful for breeding commercial hybrid species; the EST-SSRs tested here constitute useful tools for these purposes. The EST-SSR markers scattered throughout thePetuniagenome are very efficient tools for characterizing the genetic diversity in wild taxa of this genus and are able to classify interspecific hybrids based on the presence of private alleles. These factures indicate that the markers presented here are helpful tools for evolutionary studies.
