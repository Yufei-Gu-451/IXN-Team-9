Living organisms are influenced by rhythmic changes in the environment due to the Earth's rotation around its axis. In an attempt to optimally adapt to such recurring events, most species have evolved circadian clocks, internal timing systems controlling 24-h rhythms of behavior and physiology (1). In mammals, most, if not all, cells harbor their own molecular timer. Internal synchrony and thus overt behavioral and physiological rhythms are regulated via a hierarchical system of central and peripheral clocks. External time information is perceived by a master circadian pacemaker located in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus, which relays timing cues to the rest of the body. In the suprachiasmatic nucleus and the periphery, the molecular clock machinery is based on interlocked transcriptional-translational feedback loops comprised of a set of clock genes. The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors CLOCK and BMAL1 (ARNTL) induce expression of the negative regulatorsPer1-3andCry1/2through binding to E-box promoter elements. With a delay of several hours, PER/CRY protein complexes enter the nucleus and repress activity of CLOCK/BMAL1 heterodimers, thereby shutting down their own transcription. Further loops interact with this E-box-mediated transcription rhythm and stabilize its characteristic 24-h periodicity. Clock genes further regulate the activity of numerous tissue-specific output genes, thereby translating time-of-day information into physiologically meaningful signals (2). Both rodent and human studies suggest a tight interaction between circadian clock regulation and energy homeostasis. Circadian disruption, either external (as seen for example in shift workers) or internal (e.g., inClockgene mutant mice), can lead to obesity and the development of type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome (3-6). While appetite regulation appears mostly centrally controlled, recent animal studies indicate an additional role for peripheral tissue clocks in the control of energy metabolism. For instance, local circadian oscillators in liver and pancreas regulate glucose utilization, whereas cardiomyocyte clocks are involved in cardiac repolarization (6-8). White adipose tissues (WATs) store large amounts of lipids in the form of triglycerides (TGs). During extended periods of energy shortage (e.g., fasting), the release of lipids from WAT mediated by the hydrolysis of TGs to free fatty acids (FFAs) and glycerol (lipolysis) becomes an important energy source for other organs. The timing of FFA release from adipose stores, however, has to be tightly controlled, as excess of circulating lipids may lead to lipotoxicity and promote cardiovascular disorders (9). In contrast, redundant deposition of TGs causes obesity, a risk factor for type 2 diabetes. Previous reports show that adipose tissues exhibit rhythmic clock gene expression in mice and man (10-12). Cell-based and animal studies suggest that clock genes are positive regulators of adipogenesis (13,14). It remains unclear, however, how circadian disruption may lead to increased adipose tissue deposition and obesity, as observed in human shift workers and in various clock gene mutant mice. In this study, we analyze the role of white adipose clocks in lipid utilization in mice. We show that self-sustained local clocks regulate rhythmic FFA release from WAT stores, thus revealing a novel and peripherally regulated mechanism by which circadian disruption may impinge on energy homeostasis. Male wild-type (C57BL/6), congenic homozygousClockNone(15),Bmal1None(16), andPER2::LUCIFERASE(17) mice of 2-4 months of age were used for all experiments. All animal experiments were done after ethical assessment and licensed by the Office of Consumer Protection and Food Safety of the State of Lower Saxony and in accordance with the German Law of Animal Welfare. Mice were housed in small groups of five or fewer under a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle (LD) or constant darkness (DD) conditions with food and water access ad libitum. Wild-type orPER2::LUCIFERASEmice (17) were LD entrained and killed by cervical dislocation at Zeitgeber time (ZT) 9 (i.e., 3 h before lights off). WAT and brown adipose tissue (BAT) samples were isolated and washed with 1* Hanks' balanced salt solution (PAA Laboratories, Colbe, Germany). Tissues were divided into 20-30-mg pieces and cultured in colorless Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; PAA Laboratories) supplemented with 10% FBS (PAA Laboratories) and 100 nmol/L luciferin sodium salt (Biosynth, Staad, Switzerland). For RNA extraction fat pads were removed at 6-h intervals, and total RNA was extracted and processed as described below. Bioluminescence recordings were performed using a Lumicycle luminometer (Actimetrics, Willmette, IL). Period and damping rate were calculated using the Lumicycle Analysis software (Actimetrics). Mice were entrained to LD for at least 2 weeks, released into DD, and killed at 37, 43, 49, 55, and 61 h after lights off (corresponding to circadian times 1, 7, 13, and 19, respectively). For LD cohorts, mice were kept under LD and killed at ZT1, 7, 13, and 19. Epididymal fat was isolated, and total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Darmstadt, Germany). cDNA synthesis was performed by High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Life Technologies) using random hexamer primers. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using iQ SYBR Green Supermix on an CFX96 thermocycler (Bio-Rad, Munich, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Relative gene expression was quantified using a ?? threshold cycle method andEef1alphaas a reference gene (18). Primer sequences are listed inSupplementary Table 1. A 4.3-kb fragment containing the murine adipose TG lipase (Atgl) upstream sequence and the first intron were PCR-amplified from genomic DNA using Advantage 2 polymerase mix (Clontech, Mountain View, CA). PCR products were digested withHindIII (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) andXhoI (New England Biolabs) and cloned intoHindIII/XhoI-digestedpGL4vector (Promega, Madison, WI). A 4.5-kb fragment of the murine hormone-sensitive lipase (Hsl) promoter was PCR-amplified as described forAtgl. PCR products were cloned into thepGL3vector by In-Fusion Cloning (Clontech). Inserts were confirmed by sequencing. E-box mutations to GGATCC were performed using a PCR mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) and confirmed by sequencing. Primer sequences are listed inSupplementary Table 2. HEK293A and NIH-3T3 cells were maintained in DMEM (PAA Laboratories) supplemented with 10% FBS (PAA Laboratories) and antibiotics. One day prior to transfection, cells were plated onto 24-well plates at a density of 105cells/well. HEK cells were cotransfected using PEI (Sigma-Aldrich, Hamburg, Germany) and 50 ng ofpGL3/4reporter plasmid in the presence of 200 ng ofBmal1,Clock, orCry1constructs. EmptypcDNA3.1vector was used to make up the total amount of DNA to 0.7 mug/well. A total of 10 ng of apRL-CMV Renillaluciferase reporter vector (Promega) was added to each reaction as internal control. Two days later, cells were harvested and assayed using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) on a TriStar LB941 luminometer (Berthold Technologies, Wildbach, Germany). NIH-3T3 cells were transfected using X-fect (Clontech) with 1 mugpGL3-Hsl,pGL4-Atgl, orBmal1-luc(19) reporter plasmids. Two days later, cells were synchronized by 50% serum shock for 2 h. For luminescence recordings, cells were kept in colorless DMEM, 10% FBS, and 100 nmol/L luciferin sodium salt (Life Technologies). Epididymal fat pads from wild-type andBmal1Nonemice were isolated at ZT7 and ZT19, homogenized, and immediately cross linked in 1% formaldehyde. Chromatin was sonicated to obtain an average DNA length of ?400 bp (15-s on/20-s off cycles for 22 min) using a Bioruptor (Diagenode Inc.). Samples were incubated overnight at 4 degrees C with BMAL1 antibody (N-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After clearing, samples were incubated with A/G agarose beads (Thermo Scientific) for 1 h at 4 degrees C followed by intensive washings. Afterward, samples were boiled for 10 min in 10% Chelex (Bio-Rad) with Proteinase K (150 ug/mL) and spun down. DNA-containing supernatant was collected for PCR. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed as described above, and values were normalized to percentage of input. Primer sequences are listed inSupplementary Table 3. Epididymal fat pads from were dissected at the given time points, cut into 10-25 mg samples, and incubated at 37 degrees C in DMEM and 10% FBS with antibiotics. Glycerol release was measured from media aliquots using Free Glycerol Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) and normalized to fat pad dry weight. Trunk blood was collected at circadian times/ZT 1, 7, 13, and 19 and was allowed to clot. Subsequently serum was isolated by centrifugation at 2,000gfor 20 min at 4 degrees C. Serum FFAs, TG/glycerol, and cholesterol levels were determined using a NEFA kit (Zen-Bio, Research Triangle Park, NC), serum TG determination kit (Sigma-Aldrich), and cholesterol assay kit (Cayman Chemical) according to the manufacturers' protocols. Freshly isolated epididymal WAT samples were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS overnight. Samples were dehydrated with ascending alcohol concentrations and embedded in paraffin. Sections were cut at 6 mum and stained with hematoxylin-eosin. Adipocyte size was determined with Image J software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). All results are expressed as a mean +/- SEM. For statistical comparison unpaired two-tailed Studentttests or two-way ANOVAs with Bonferroni posttests were performed using Prism 5 software (GraphPad Software). Analysis of circadian gene expression was performed with CircWave software (20) downloaded athttp://www.euclock.org. Pvalues less than 0.05 were considered significant. To gain more insights into the circadian regulation of lipid metabolism, we compared diurnal profiles of various lipid parameters in serum between circadian clock-deficientClockNoneand wild-type mice. Consistent with a previous report (4),ClockNonemice had significantly higher cholesterol levels in the blood, albeit no significant circadian variation was observed in either genotype (Fig. 1None). In contrast, serum TG levels were rhythmic, but indistinguishable between genotypes (Fig. 1None). Interestingly, FFA serum levels showed a robust circadian profile in wild-type animals (P= 0.005). This rhythm was abolished, and overall levels were decreased inClockNonemutants (P= 0.802) (Fig. 1None), suggesting an involvement of the circadian clock machinery in the regulation of fatty acid release from TG stores. In line with this hypothesis, serum glycerol concentrations showed similar variations in wild-type serum, whereas inClockNonemutants, levels were nonrhythmic and overall low (P= 0.003 vs.P= 0.678) (Fig. 1None). Comparable effects on FFA and glycerol levels were also observed under LD conditions (Fig. 1NoneandNone) and in another clock-deficient mouse model,Bmal1None(Fig. 1NoneandNone). Surprisingly, while blood TG and FFA levels were unaltered or low,ClockNonemutants at the same time exhibited higher overall body weight gain with increased adiposity (Fig. 2NoneandNoneandSupplementary Fig. 1None) together with hyperphagy, but unaltered overall activity (Supplementary Fig. 1NoneandNone) (4). Histological analysis of WAT paraffin sections revealed increased WAT lipid accumulation and adipocyte hypertrophy inClockNonemutant mice (Fig. 2None), suggesting that theClockmutation either promotes lipid accumulation or inhibits lipid mobilization in WAT. Serum lipids change inClockNonemice.

All data are shown as means +/- SEM. Circadian clocks regulate local cellular physiology via transcriptional programs involving large numbers of tissue-specific clock-controlled genes (21). To test if molecular clocks are involved in regulating WAT physiology, we analyzed circadian variations in mRNAs of genes involved in WAT lipid metabolism. Genes were selected using the Gene Ontology database (http://www.geneontology.org) and expression data assembled on BioGPS (http://biogps.org) and compared with published literature (Supplementary Fig. 2None). Epididymal WAT transcript levels were assessed at the beginning of the rest phase (37 h in DD) and in the early subjective night (49 h in DD). For genes which showed significant regulation between both time points, we determined full circadian transcriptional profiles inClockNoneand wild-type mice. Of the genes associated with FFA transport and TG biosynthesis (i.e., the conversion of FFAs for storage in adipose lipid droplets),Caveolin2, the acyl-CoA synthetasesAcsl1andAcsl4and the phosphatidate phosphataseLpin1showed significant differences in expression between 37 and 49 h in DD (Fig. 3None). InClockNonemutants, FFA transport/TG biosynthesis mRNAs were either unaffected (Acsl4, Lpl) or dampened and overall downregulated when compared with wild-type controls (Fig. 3NoneandNoneandSupplementary Fig. 2None). In contrast, the mRNAs of two rate-limiting lipolytic enzymes,Atgl(orPnpla2) andHsl(orLipe), exhibited circadian variations in wild-type animals (Fig. 3None), while inClockNonemutants,AtglandHslmRNA levels (together with that ofMgll) were significantly reduced and arrhythmic (Fig. 4None) (P less than 0.001 vs.P= 0.85 [Atgl] andP less than 0.001 vs.P= 0.63 [Hsl], respectively), strongly correlating with the reduced and arrhythmic FFA/glycerol serum levels observed in these mice (Fig. 1). To test TG breakdown from WAT stores more directly, we performed lipolysis assays on fat pad explants at four different time points in DD and LD. In wild-types, glycerol excretion showed a rhythmic pattern, whereas dampened rhythmicity and a general downregulation of basal lipolysis rates were observed in explants ofClockNonemice (Fig. 4NoneandNone) (P= 0.001 vs.P= 0.95 [DD] andP less than 0.001 vs.P= 0.63 [LD], respectively). Of note, on the second day in DD,Clockmutants retained a rhythmic, though dampened, feeding profile (Supplementary Fig. 3None). Moreover, when animals were subjected to nighttime restricted feeding (i.e., food access between ZT12 and ZT24) under LD conditions, daytimeAtglandHsllevels remained reduced inClockmutant mice, indicating thatAtgl/Hsltranscription does not merely reflect feeding rhythms (Supplementary Fig. 3None). Analogously,Bmal1Nonemice showed lower expression levels ofAtglandHsl(Fig. 4None) andBmal1-deficient fat pads displayed lower lipolysis rates (Fig. 4None)Circadian clock controls TG metabolism in WAT. A: mRNA levels of genes involved in adipocyte TG metabolism from wild-type (WT) WAT samples isolated at two opposite circadian time points, 37 h (open bars) and 49 h (closed bars) in DD (n= 3 per time point [*P less than 0.05; **P less than 0.01 by unpairedttest]).

All data are shown as means +/- SEM. *P less than 0.05; **P less than 0.01; ***P less than 0.001 by two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni posttest. To further characterize the circadian regulation of adipose physiology, we analyzed WAT clock gene regulation in DD. Expression ofBmal1,Per2, andDbpgenes exhibited robust circadian variations in wild-type animals, which were significantly downregulated and arrhythmic (Per2,Dbp) or dampened (Bmal1) inClockNonemutant mice (Fig. 5None). To characterize the sustainability of molecular circadian rhythms in WAT and compare clock function between different fat depots, we cultured epididymal, perirenal, peritoneal, subcutaneous white, as well as intrascapular BAT fat explants fromPER2::LUCIFERASEcircadian reporter mice. All cultures showed sustained bioluminescence rhythms in the circadian range for several days (Fig. 5NoneandSupplementary Fig. 4None) (17). The phases of luminescent oscillations were comparable between different depots and to those reported from other peripheral tissue explants (17,22) (Supplementary Fig. 4None). Periodogram analysis revealed endogenous periodicities of ?25 h; statistically significant differences in period were only observed between epididymal white fat and BAT (25.8 +/- 0.2 vs. 24.7 +/- 0.3 h;Supplementary Fig. 4None). Moreover, rhythm dampening was comparable among all adipose tissues tested (Supplementary Fig. 4None). To test ifAtglandHsltranscription is clock-driven at the tissue level, we kept epididymal fat explants in culture for 36 h. We observed rhythmicAtglandHslmRNA expression in wild-type fat pads (P less than 0.001 andP= 0.006, respectively). Similar to what was observed in vivo, transcript variations were abolished, and overall levels were reduced in explants fromClockNonemice (P greater than 0.8 for both genes) (Fig. 5None). Notably, the expression rhythms of the two lipolytic genes were in phase coherence with E-box-regulated genes such asPer2and in antiphase toBmal1(compareFig. 5NoneandNone). Taken together, these data suggested a direct control ofAtglandHslexpression by CLOCK and BMAL1. Local WAT clocks regulate expression ofAtglandHsl.

All data are shown as means +/- SEM. *P less than 0.05; **P less than 0.01; ***P less than 0.001 by two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni posttest. CPS, counts per second. We identified two canonical E-box sequences (CACGTG) in the first intron ofAtgl(chr7: 148642099-148642104, 148642860-148642866) and in the upstream region ofHsl(chr7: 26181156-26181161, 26181424-26181430). Genomic DNA fragments containing thesecis-regulatory elements were used for luciferase-based transactivation assays in HEK293A cells (Fig. 6None). Cotransfection withClockandBmal1increased the activity of bothAtglandHslpromoters by 6.5- and 2.3-fold, respectively (Fig. 6None). Activation was inhibited by cotransfection withCry1, a negative E-box regulator. Moreover, mutation of the E-box proximal to the second exon of theAtglgene (chr7: 148642860-148642866) abolished transcriptional activation by CLOCK/BMAL1 (Fig. 6None,left). Similar results were obtained upon mutation of both upstream E-boxes in theHslpromoter (Fig. 6None,right). To confirm direct BMAL1 promoter binding in vivo, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) on epididymal adipose tissue sampled at two different time points. ChIP analysis revealed time-of-day dependent occupancy of BMAL1 onDbp, Atgl, andHslE-boxes, but not on 500-bp downstream regions in wild-type mice. InBmal1-deficient animals, binding signal was markedly reduced (Fig. 6None). Finally, we transfectedAtgl-lucandHsl-lucconstructs into NIH-3T3 cells and recorded bioluminescence for 48 h after serum shock synchronization. We observed a rhythmic bioluminescence signal forAtgl-lucandHsl-lucantiphasic toBmal1-luc(Supplementary Fig. 4NoneandNone), comparable to what has been reported for other E-box controlled genes such asPer2(23). Together, these results strongly suggest that circadianAtglandHsltranscription is directly regulated by CLOCK/BMAL1 via E-box activation at the adipose tissue level.

All data are shown as means +/- SEM. Lipolysis becomes an important energy source during the fasting (i.e., rest) phase of the day. In line with this, reduced FFA mobilization provokes aberrant physiological responses under fasting conditions (24). To test if fasting responses are impaired inClockNonemutants, we food-deprived mutant and wild-type mice starting at the end of the light phase (ZT12). FFA and glycerol levels were upregulated in serum in response to 12- and 24-h starves (starting at the end of the normal rest phase, at ZT12) in wild-types, whereas the lipolytic response was severely dampened inClockNoneanimals (Fig. 7NoneandNone). Given that FFA release, and, thus, the availability of lipids as energy source, appeared impaired, we speculated that under fasting conditions, mutants may rely more heavily on carbohydrate or protein utilization (24). In line with this, liver glycogen stores inClockNonemice were depleted much faster than in wild-types under fasting conditions (Fig. 7None). Moreover, after food removal, mutants showed lower rectal temperature when compared with wild-type controls, implying decreased thermogenesis due to general energy shortage (Fig. 7None).

Circadian physiological rhythms are generated by interplay between systemic time cues (e.g., rhythmic hormones or metabolites) and the orchestration of transcriptional programs by local tissue oscillators. As a result many physiological parameters that exhibit diurnal variations are altered in mice with perturbed molecular clocks (5,6). In this article, we report that blood FFA and glycerol concentrations show strong variations across the day. This rhythm appears to not merely reflect rhythmic food intake and seems to critically depend on the presence of functional CLOCK/BMAL1. Moreover, in humans, it has been shown that FFA and glycerol are still rhythmic under constant routine conditions (25). During fasting conditions (e.g., during the daily rest phase), adipose-released FFAs become an important energy source (26,27). Therefore, the mobilization of FFAs may be critically involved in the regulation of metabolic homeostasis. In line with previous studies in rats (28,29), we showed circadian rhythms in baseline WAT lipolysis rates and FFA levels in the blood of wild-type mice. InClockNoneandBmal1Nonemutants, both rhythms were flattened and downregulated [our data and (30,31)], indicating defects in lipid mobilization. In agreement with this, it has previously been demonstrated that youngBmal1Nonemice show increased adiposity (8,32,33), while C57BL/6ClockNoneanimals are obese and are more sensitive to high-fat diet (4). Rhythmic clock gene expression has been detected in many tissues in rodents and humans including various adipose depots (10-12). UsingPER2::LUCIFERASEfat-pad explants cultures, we showed that adipose clocks display similar endogenous rhythm sustainment as described for other peripheral oscillators. We identifiedAtglandHsl, which encode for two lipolysis pacemaker enzymes responsible for greater than 95% of TG hydrolysis activity (34), as targets of the local WAT clock machinery. Atgl/Hsl transcriptional rhythms were accompanied by rhythmic lipolytic activity in explant cultures and rhythmic elevation of the lipolysis products FFAs and glycerol in the blood. Of note, increasedAtgl/HslmRNA expression preceded the elevation of lipolytic products in the blood of wild-type animals by several hours, probably reflecting a delay between the initiation of the lipolytic response and the emergence of a measurable physiological effect. This delay results in high glycerol and FFA levels during the rest phase when both are used for energy production. Hsl-deficient mice show hypertrophic adipocytes, reduced lipolysis rates, and decreased FFA levels, though their body weight is normal (35). Atglconventional and adipocyte-specific mutants display the same phenotype together with increased body weight (36-39). Although the precise mechanism by which impaired lipolysis contributes to the development of obesity is not well-understood, cell-based studies suggest that reduced expression ofAtglandHslleads to TG accumulation in lipid droplets in adipocytes (40,41). Consistent with this hypothesis, our data suggest that dampened circadian lipolysis rhythms, as seen inClockandBmal1mutant mice, may promote TG accumulation in WAT. Moreover, reduced availability of FFAs as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor cofactors may disrupt oxidative metabolism in mitochondria in other organs (39,42). Of note, expression of both enzymes was reported to be decreased in adipose tissue in obesity, thus leaving a possibility that downregulation ofAtglandHsltranscript levels inClockNoneandBmal1Noneanimals might be rather the consequence than the cause of their adiposity. Our in vitro data suggest thatAtglandHslare direct targets of CLOCK/BMAL1, independent of metabolic state, but further studies are needed to clarify the impact of body weight and composition in this context (43,44). Moreover, we cannot exclude that disrupted feeding rhythms inClockNone(Supplementary Fig. 2) mice may impinge on lipolysis rates via hormonal regulation (e.g., via leptin or insulin, which are known to induce and inhibit lipolysis, respectively) (45,46). However, circadian feeding profiles were not totally arrhythmic inClockmutant mice, andAtgl/Hslexpression remained dampened in rhythmically fedClockmutants. Further, reduced pancreatic secretion of insulin and hyperleptinemia have been reported inClockNonemice (4,6), both of which appear insufficient to restore blood FFA and glycerol levels. Instead, our results argue that rhythmic lipolysis is, at least in part, locally controlled by adipose circadian clocks. In line with this, oscillations ofAtglandHslmRNAs are sustained in fat pad explants ex vivo. Reporter gene and ChIP assays further indicate that CLOCK/BMAL1 directly and rhythmically bind to E-boxes in the promoters ofAtglandHsl. Mice with defective lipolysis exhibit impaired metabolic compensation during food deprivation (24). Consistently, our data reveal thatClockNonemutants show aberrant fasting responses. Once external energy supplies are disrupted, glycogen stores become quickly depleted, while mice are unable to fully engage their lipid stores in WAT to deliver further energy for maintaining stable body temperature. Alternatively, the development of brown adipocytes may be affected inClockNonemice, or theClockNonemutation may directly impair brown adipose thermogenesis (11,39). During the inactive phase, wild-type mice switch their energy substrate preference to lipids, which corresponds to a lower respiratory exchange ratio (47). Hsl- andAtgl-deficient animals, however, continue to primarily use carbohydrates during that time due to impaired FFA release into the blood (38). Remarkably, a similar respiratory exchange ratio phenotype was described forClockNoneandBmal1Nonemice (48,49), which, as our data suggest, could be explained by impaired lipid use. In contrast, animals lacking the transcriptional repressor and negative regulator ofBmal1REV-ERBalpha (NR1D1) show increased expression of bothClockandBmal1and use lipids as the predominant energy source through their efficient FFA mobilization and membrane transport (50). So far, the mechanistic link between circadian disruption and associated metabolic defects is not clearly understood. In this study, we show that adipose-tissue clocks may directly affect diurnal lipid homeostasis by regulating FFA/glycerol mobilization from WAT stores via transcriptional regulation of the lipolytic machinery. By this, adipocyte clock function may directly impinge on energy homeostasis, thus representing a potential new target for pharmacological resetting of circadian physiology (51,52). Based on the evidence obtained fromClockNoneandBmal1Nonemice, we suggest that impaired lipid mobilization may lead to an imbalance in energy homeostasis, promoting increased adiposity. It remains to be clarified, however, to which extent WAT lipolysis defects contribute to the obese phenotype seen inClockNonemutant mice since other alterations such as changed feeding patterns may further promote the development of obesity after circadian disruption (4,53,54).
