Articular surface injury is a frequent problem, with recovery limited by incomplete natural healing mechanisms complicated by progression to osteoarthritis (OA), which leads to further pain and dysfunction. This lack of effective healing of chondral defects has led to a need to develop therapies to restore the articular surface to near normal. Broadly, these may be considered as non-cell-based and cell-based. None,NoneCell-based therapies may be further subdivided into non-stem cell therapy or stem cell therapy. For non-stem cells, the most frequently employed technique is autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI), with further advancements employing a collagen rather than periosteal cover and third generation approaches utilizing cells seeded within bioscaffolds rather than injection as a cell suspension. NoneThe isolation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from a variety of tissues and their promise in in vitro and in animal models has led to their relatively recent implementation in humans. NoneThis review will focus on localized joint abnormalities such as chondral injury and OA. NoneA search was conducted through PubMed using various combinations of the termsstem cell, cell therapy, cell transplantation, cartilage, chondral, andchondrogenicto December 2013 with no earlier limit. Only 9 comparative studies (Table 1) were identified among a total of 45 human reports of local stem cell therapy for joint disorders (see the Appendix, available athttp://sph.sagepub.com/content/suppl). Comparative human studies involving the use of MSCs for cartilage repairNoneNoneBM-MSC, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells; ACI, autologous chondrocyte implantation; SVF, stromal vascular fraction; PBSC, peripheral blood stem cells; RCT, randomized controlled trial; BMC, bone marrow concentrate; OA, osteoarthritis; HA, hyaluronic acid; PRP, platelet-rich plasma; SD, standard deviation; ADLs, activities of daily living; ICRS, International Cartilage Repair Society; MFC, medial femoral condyle; VAS, visual analog scale; AOFAS, American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society; KOOS, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score; IKDC, International Knee Documentation Committee; SF-36, Short Form-36. All studies utilized autologous cells. BM-MSCs represent culture-expanded cells. Non-BM-MSC studies utilized non-culture expanded cells from a variety of sources. Levels of evidence are as per the Oxford 2011 Levels of Evidence. NoneThree randomized trials,None,None,None3 nonrandomized cohort studies,None,None,Noneand 1 case-control studyNonecompared stem cell with non-stem cell procedures. A further 2 cohort studies compared different stem cells or implantation methods. None,NoneStatistical analysis was not performed because of differences in study populations and methods. Non-cell-based surgical treatment includes debridement, marrow stimulation by microfracture, abrasion or drilling of the subchondral bone plate, and osteochondral grafting (mosaicplasty). None,None,NoneAbnormal cartilage in defects produces detrimental effects on adjacent and opposing cartilage, and debridement can improve symptoms and potentially minimize further chondral loss. None,NoneActivation of the innate repair mechanism by injuries involving the subchondral bone plate, as opposed to partial-thickness chondral injury, provides the rationale for marrow stimulation techniques where multiple small holes are placed in the subchondral bone of the defect. NoneThe mechanism of action is thought to be due to the influx of chondroprogenitor cells. NoneThe first report describing ACI in humans was by Brittberg et alNonein 1994, involving debridement, covering of the defect with a periosteal flap from the proximal medial tibia sutured to surrounding normal cartilage, and cultured chondrocyte injection beneath the periosteal flap. Autologous chondrocyte implantation utilizes cultured, mature, autologous chondrocytes suspended in an injectable medium with newer variants using a collagen type I/III membrane (ACI-C, CACI, second generation) rather than periosteal cover (ACI-P, first generation). NoneThird generation techniques such as matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation (MACI) use cells seeded onto the rough side of a collagen type I/III membrane with a smoother side facing the articular cavity, usually fixed with fibrin glue and sometimes sutures. NoneCharacterized chondrocyte implantation (CCI) maximizes chondrogenic capacity through a controlled ex vivo process that produces clinically significant improvement with up to 4 years follow-up. NoneComparing CCI with microfracture in a randomized trial, Saris et alNone,Nonefound improved tissue regeneration, although similar clinical outcomes, at 1 year but improved clinical outcome for CCI at 3 years. These procedures can result in improved clinical, arthroscopic, and histologic features, with hyaline-like cartilage or fibrocartilage present in 43.9% of ACI-C and 36.4% of MACI grafts in 1 prospective, randomized study by Bartlett et al. NoneIn a randomized trial comparing ACI-P to MACI, Zeifang et alNonefound better Lysholm and Gillquist scores at 12 and 24 months in the ACI-P group but no significant difference in International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Tegner Activity Score, or Short Form-36 scores. In a systematic review of cell-based therapy for chondral lesions from 1994 to 2009, Nakamura et alNoneconcluded that there was insufficient evidence to indicate superiority of cell-based therapy to non-cell-based treatments with relatively short-term follow-up and most studies demonstrating no convincing differences. Variable results have been obtained comparing ACI with microfracture, with some studies showing no significant difference and others suggesting superiority of ACI. NoneSecond and third generation techniques offer potential advantages, but longer term follow-up is required. None,NoneBasad et alNonedemonstrated significantly improved Lysholm, Tegner, patient ICRS (International Cartilage Repair Society), and surgeon ICRS scores with MACI compared with microfracture at 2 years in a randomized study. For patients undergoing ACI after failed microfracture, significantly higher failure rates were observed. NoneThe chondral defect site as well as level of sports activity and physical training may influence outcome. NoneSurgical technique and experience also play a role. Disadvantages of ACI/MACI include healthy cartilage damage at the donor site and lack of suitable donor cartilage in elderly patients with degenerative changes. None,NoneThe stem cells with the greatest capacity for differentiation are embryonic stem cells (ESCs). In addition to ethical concerns, questions of safety have arisen because of the risk of teratoma formation. NoneThese concerns have prompted the search for alternative stem cell sources including adult cells and, more recently, induced pluripotential stem cells (iPSCs), although the teratoma risk currently persists with iPSCs. None,NoneIPSCs from osteoarthritic cartilage undergo chondrogenic differentiation in vitro and show chondrogenesis after subcutaneous implantation in mice, but have not yet been used in in vivo articular surface repair. NoneMesenchymal stem cells are multipotential cells originally isolated from bone marrow but naturally existing in many tissues, often around blood vessels. They are defined by the expression of various cell surface molecules (eg, CD73, CD90, CD105), the capacity for self-renewal, and the ability to differentiate into osteogenic, chondrogenic, or adipogenic lineages. None,NoneWhile this capacity already signifies their applicability to musculoskeletal conditions, they also possess potent anti-inflammatory/immunosuppressive properties,Nonewhich may predict efficacy in OA. None,NoneMesenchymal stem cells are being isolated from an increasingly wider variety of human tissues, including bone marrow,Noneadipose tissue,Noneskeletal muscle,Nonesynovial membraneNone,Noneand synovial fluid,Noneperiosteum,Noneperipheral blood,Noneumbilical cord blood,Noneendometrium,Noneamniotic fluid,Noneand placenta. NoneThe potential therapeutic value for MSCs in the treatment of joint disorders is multifactorial, including paracrine effects on regenerating native tissue and immunomodulatory effects. None,NoneThe cytokine-based immunosuppressive properties of MSCs potentially induce immune tolerance, prompting investigation in multiple sclerosis, foreign graft rejection, and rheumatoid arthritis. None,NoneThese immunomodulatory effects may help slow the progression of OA by targeting the inflammatory processes in its pathogenesis. NoneSo far, in the musculoskeletal system, MSCs derived from autologous bone marrow, subcutaneous adipose tissue, infrapatellar fat, and peripheral blood have been utilized in humans in treating osteochondral injury, OA, and rheumatoid arthritis. None,None,None,NoneHematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and bone marrow-MSCs (BM-MSCs) represent different cells lines, with only BM-MSCs used for chondral regeneration. HSCs renew blood elements while MSCs can differentiate into mesenchymal elements, including cartilage. NoneMost animal and human stem cell studies for cartilage repair used BM-MSCs. Initial human reports employed culture-expanded BM-MSCs,Nonebut subsequent publications utilized bone marrow concentrate (BMC) without expansion, allowing a same-day procedure. None,NoneBMC contains nucleated cells with a small stem cell component derived from marrow aspirates after removal of most red cells and plasma by centrifugation. NoneBoth show benefits compared with controls in small, human studies. None,None,None,None,NoneTechnique-related differences in aspirate yields include site (anterior vs posterior iliac crest) and syringe size. NoneSubstantial variability also exists for MSC counts between patients. NoneFor these reasons, comparison between studies or patients within a study is difficult unless the sample is analyzed prior to implantation. Although cell numbers may be counted, characterization with surface markers is required to assess true stem cell counts. None,NoneReported transplanted BM-MSC counts range from 8 millionNoneto 45.6 millionNonecells. Outcome for femoral head osteonecrosis and tibial nonunion is proportionate to the number of transplanted progenitor cells. None,NoneThis remains to be shown in humans for cartilage, but the principle of improved healing with greater cell numbers is important. In vitro work shows that increasing initial seeding density of BM-MSC enhances chondrogenesis. NoneGovernment regulation forms a barrier to using culture-expanded cells in some countries, including the United States, as the degree of ex vivo manipulation classifies the treatment in the same manner as a drug. NoneGeographic locations of human studies are listed (see the Appendix, available athttp://sph.sagepub.com/content/suppl). The US Food and Drug Administration has currently not approved any stem cell products for use in the United States other than cord blood-derived hematopoietic stem cells for certain indications. NoneWhile the use of culture-expanded cells is prohibited, some clinics offer same day procedures using minimally manipulated cells such as BMC, concentrated at the point of care. NoneThe issue of stem cell regulation continues to be a subject of active debate. An apparent disadvantage of BM-MSCs is that cell numbers diminish with age and exhibit reduced proliferative capacity and increased rates of apoptosis compared with BM-MSC from younger patients. NoneMesenchymal stem cells in adipose tissue arise from or form perivascular cells. None,None,NoneAdipose tissue contains proportionally higher numbers of MSCs (approximately 10% of nucleated cells) than bone marrow and is amenable to liposuction without significant morbidity. In contrast to BM-MSCs, numbers do not decline with age but do decline with obesity. NoneStem cells may differ in numbers from abdominal adipose tissue compared with the hip or thigh, but proliferation and differentiation do not appear influenced by harvest site. NoneAs with bone marrow, adipose stem cells may be utilized in 2 major forms. Stromal vascular fraction (SVF) is a heterogeneous population of cells that may contain MSCs, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, leukocytes (lymphocytes and macrophages), and pericytes. NoneStem cells from SVF may be separated and expanded in vitro (adipose-derived stem cells [ADSCs]). An advantage of SVF and BMC is elimination of the time lag between harvest and implantation, minimizing exposure to risks, reducing cost and logistical difficulties. None,None,NoneHowever, the lack of cellular content identification of SVF is a major problem in evaluating clinical efficacy and patient responses. SVF contains large numbers of T regulatory (Treg) cells that may assist in immunosuppression and tolerance induction. NoneIntra-articular SVF has been successfully utilized in dogs with elbow or hip OA but with suboptimal results in horses. None,None,NoneCo-administration of non-infrapatellar fat-derived SVF showed superior clinical results at mean 21.8-month follow-up compared with non-MSC controls in a human study. NoneImproved cartilage repair was seen with culture-expanded ADSCs compared with controls in rabbit full-thickness chondral defects with better integration and more hyaline cartilage formation, but their use in humans has not been reported. NoneInfrapatellar fat differs in composition to subcutaneous adipose tissue, containing a large amount of collagenous tissue and possibly synoviocytes. NoneWhile exhibiting characteristics of ADSCs,Nonethey have more similarities with fibrous synovium-derived cells than subcutaneous fat-derived cells, and possibly greater chondrogenic potential. NoneIn rabbits, cells cultured from infrapatellar fat showed promising results compared with controls. NoneInfrapatellar SVF (not culture-expanded) has shown similar clinical findings in humans at 1 year compared with MSC free controls undergoing arthroscopic debridement, implying a potential benefit from MSC because of poorer preoperative clinical scores and ICRS grades. NonePeripheral blood presents another source of MSCs, obtained with relative ease and no significant donor site morbidity. NoneMSCs derived from human peripheral blood cells (PBSCs) exhibit similar in vitro chondrogenic potential to BM-MSCs, although they are far less concentrated in blood than in marrow. NoneUse of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) increases MSC numbers in peripheral blood. None,NoneWhile generally well tolerated, rare risks of G-CSF in healthy donors include splenic rupture and adult respiratory distress syndrome, although the theoretical risk of hematologic malignancy remains to be proven in the healthy donor population. NoneFollowing an initial pilot report,NonePBSCs have been assessed in a randomized study augmenting arthroscopic subchondral drilling with postprocedural injections of either PBSC and hyaluronic acid (HA) or HA alone, reporting improved histologic and MRI scores at 18 months but no significant clinical difference at 24 months. NoneOther stem cell sources trialed in animals, but not humans, include periosteum, synovium, and skeletal muscle. None,None,None,NoneSurgical implantation may be similar to ACI, with MSCs beneath a periostealNoneor collagenNonecover instead of cultured chondrocytes. None,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,NoneNoneNoneNone-NoneA cell-seeded construct (analogous to MACI) may be used rather than suspended cells. NoneAn ideal scaffold is nontoxic, absorbable, mechanically sound, and promotes cell growth. NoneWakitani et alNonefound that osteochondral progenitor cells from bone marrow or periosteum in type I collagen gel produced superior repair of full-thickness rabbit medial femoral condylar defects compared with empty defects or a cell-free collagen gel with hyaline cartilage formation and mechanically superior repair tissue. Macroscopic appearance at 24 weeks and histologic appearance at 12 and 24 weeks was less favorable than at 4 weeks postimplantation. NoneWakitani et alNoneused culture-expanded BM-MSCs in collagen gel in medial femoral condylar defects of humans with OA at the time of high tibial osteotomy, with 12 patients randomized to each group. Subchondral abrasion was performed to facilitate bleeding. A BM-MSC-collagen gel sheet composite was applied to the defect and covered with autologous periosteum. The control group received the same treatment without BM-MSCs. BM-MSC patients demonstrated improved arthroscopic and histologic scores 28 to 95 weeks following treatment, with no clinical difference, including on repeat assessment at 64 months. None,NoneGobbi et alNoneapplied a 1-step open approach with BMC (nonexpanded) following debridement of knee chondral lesions in 15 patients using a collagen membrane cover. Most underwent associated procedures. Significant clinical improvement was noted at 6, 12, and 24 months (visual analog scale [VAS], Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score [KOOS], IKDC, SF-36, Tegner, Marx, Lysholm). Defect filling at MRI was complete in 12 cases and incomplete in 3 cases. Arthroscopic evaluation in 4 knees was normal to nearly normal, and histology in 3 patients showed hyaline-like features. NoneSkowronski and RutkaNoneshowed significantly better KOOS, Lysholm, and VAS scores for PBSC over nonexpanded BMC in conjunction with autologous iliac bone grafting of medial femoral condylar osteochondral lesions at 6 months and 1 year, but commented that it could reflect double the transplanted cell numbers compared with the BMC group, with possible contribution from more stem cells provided by marrow stimulation in the G-CSF-treated PBSC group. Regarding open foot and ankle chondral defect repairs, implantation of nonexpanded BMC-impregnated collagen matrix was reported by Richter and ZechNonein 25 patients who were followed up with at 2 years with significant improvements in VAS foot and ankle scores. Giannini et alNone,Nonefollowed 49 patients, aged 14 to 50 years, for 4 years after 1-step arthroscopic implantation of nonexpanded BMC for talar osteochondral lesions, with either collagen powder/platelet gel or HA membrane/platelet gel scaffolds. American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) scores improved, with best results at 24 months, but deteriorating at 36 and 48 months. Few studies directly compare stem cell treatment to ACI. Adachi et alNoneshowed similar results of B-galactosidase gene-transfected muscle-derived stem cells (MDSCs) with similarly transfected chondrocytes in rabbits. Testing a gellan gum hydrogel in rabbits, Oliveira et alNonenoted improved hyaline cartilage formation with chondrogenically predifferentiated ADSCs compared with chondrocytes, but similar results between undifferentiated ADSCs and chondrocytes. Autologous, cultured BM-MSCs were compared with matrix-associated autologous chondrocyte transplantation in sheep, both suspended in collagen gel, with superior results for BM-MSCs at 1 year, particularly regarding integration with adjacent native cartilage. NoneArthroscopic, nonexpanded BMC implantation was retrospectively compared with open field and arthroscopic ACI. NoneSignificant clinical improvement was found in all 3 groups at 36 months, with no significant difference between them. Second-look arthroscopies demonstrated intact cartilage in all cases, with components of hyaline cartilage at biopsy. The 1-step arthroscopic BMC technique was less than half the cost of the 2-step arthroscopic ACI technique. NoneNejadnik et alNonematched 36 patients undergoing ACI-P with 36 patients receiving autologous, culture-expanded BM-MSCs, with cultured chondrocytes or BM-MSCs implanted beneath a sutured periosteal patch in similar techniques. No significant difference was shown between the 2 groups in terms of clinical outcome up to 24 months except for physical role functioning, which was better improved for the BM-MSC group. The BM-MSC therapy required only 1 surgery, reduced costs, and caused less donor site morbidity. In contrast to the ACI group, an age-related response was not evident with BM-MSCs. NoneIntra-articular injection holds several potential advantages, including reduced recovery time and less cost. None,None,None,None,None,NoneSame day intra-articular administration of cells surgically obtained from the infrapatellar fat pad has been used to augment arthroscopic debridement. NoneFrom a therapeutic perspective, intra-articular injection may be better matched to the pathogenesis of OA,None,Nonealthough it may increase the risk of synovial proliferation. NoneIn animal studies involving surgically created injuries to anterior cruciate ligaments, menisci, and articular cartilage, intra-articularly administered labeled BM-MSCs migrated to sites of injury. None,None,NoneTo enhance migration to the desired location, Kobayashi et alNoneutilized an external magnetic force to direct magnetically labeled, intra-articularly injected BM-MSCs to experimentally created osteochondral defects in rabbit and swine patellae. In a further laboratory study, the magnetic force improved cell adhesion with no deleterious effects on cell proliferation for up to 3 weeks. NoneThe anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects of MSCs may retard the progression of OA. Intra-articular injections of stem cells slowed progression of surgically induced OA in goats following a single intra-articular dose of cultured BM-MSCs,Nonein rabbits using infrapatellar fat pad-derived MSCs,Noneand in rats using MDSCs with transduced genes. NoneBM-MSCs may also prevent the onset of posttraumatic OA in mice when injected at the same time as experimentally created closed tibial plateau fracture. NoneStudies of animals with spontaneous OA, as well as experimental OA, have also reported improvement following MSC injection. None,None,None,NoneCell labeling shows incorporation into damaged cartilage and partial cartilage regeneration in guinea pigs using cultured human BM-MSCs. NoneBlack et alNonereported significant clinical improvement in dogs with spontaneous OA of the coxofemoral joint following intra-articular SVF compared with placebo in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. Improvements were also noted following a single humeroradial SVF injection for dogs with elbow OA, although with no control group in this study. NoneGuercio et alNonefound improved clinical benefit following ADSC injection in 4 dogs with lameness due humeroradial OA that had previously failed to respond to anti-inflammatory drugs. While most investigations appear to focus on restoration of articular cartilage, stem cell therapy may also benefit meniscal defects in animals and humans. None,NoneOrozco et alNonefollowed 12 patients receiving intra-articular, autologous-expanded BM-MSCs (40 * 106cells) for 1 year, demonstrating significantly improved VAS, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), and Lequesne scores, with no significant difference in SF-36 and reduction in pain occurring within 3 months. Decreased poor quality cartilage on T2 mapping was seen in 11 patients. No human studies have yet compared MSC injection with other treatments in the absence of concurrent surgery. Mesenchymal stem cell injection has been utilized as an adjunct to surgical techniques in humansNone,None,Noneand animals. None,NoneIn goats, BM-MSCs in alginate applied between osteochondral plugs during mosaicplasty was superior at 24 weeks compared with mosaicplasty alone, and better still using transforming growth factor-beta1-transduced BM-MSCs. NoneComparing intra-articular BM-MSCs and HA to intra-articular HA alone following microfracture of full-thickness chondral defects in horses, McIlwraith et alNonenoted significantly increased firmness and a non-significant trend for better overall repair quality with BM-MSCs. The location of the infrapatellar fat pad makes it an attractive harvest target. Koh and ChoiNoneutilized intra-articular injection of nonexpanded infrapatellar fat cells combined with arthroscopic debridement and PRP in humans with knee OA, with similar 1-year clinical findings compared with controls receiving only PRP post-debridement but significantly worse preoperative clinical (Tegner, Lysholm, and VAS) scores and ICRS grades in the MSC group, favoring a benefit from MSC injection. Of the 25 MSC patients, 18 were reassessed at 2 years, with significantly improved clinical features (WOMAC, Lysholm, and VAS scores) as well as MRI scores compared with preoperative, including significant clinical improvement in patients with grade 3 compared with grade 4 OA. NoneThe fat pad was acquired at surgery, but the 3- to 4-hour processing necessitated a separate procedure that day. NoneKim et alNoneused non-expanded buttock adipose cells (SVF) as an intra-articular supplement to arthroscopic debridement and microfracture of talar osteochondral lesions. Significantly better clinical scores were obtained with MSC (31 ankles) compared with arthroscopic surgery alone (37 ankles). In a randomized trial, Varma et alNonecompared 25 patients with mild to moderate knee OA undergoing arthroscopic debridement alone with 25 patients undergoing arthroscopic debridement followed by intra-articular, nonexpanded BMC injection. Significant improvements in activities of daily living, sports and recreational activity, and quality of life scores were seen at 6 months. NoneSaw et alNonerandomized 50 patients with ICRS grade 3-4 chondral defects undergoing arthroscopic debridement and subchondral drilling to a series of 8 injections of either non-expanded PBSC and HA or HA alone. Significantly better histologic scores (1066 vs 957) and MRI scores (9.9 vs 8.5) were reported at 18 months, with blinding of the reporting radiologist and pathologist, although no significant difference in IKDC scores at 24 months (74.8 vs 71.1). NoneLee et alNonecompared 35 knee full-thickness chondral defects undergoing arthroscopic debridement and microfracture, followed by outpatient injection of culture-expanded BM-MSC and HA, with 35 matched patients receiving open implantation of BM-MSC sheets beneath a sutured periosteal cover. Both groups showed significantly improved IKDC, Lysholm, VAS, and SF-36 scores at up to 2 years. The arthroscopic-injected group experienced more improvement in IKDC and Lysholm scores compared with the open group but similar improvement in VAS and SF-36 scores. MRI at 1 year showed good defect filling and integration. NonePlatelet-rich plasma (PRP) is a source of autologous growth factors and an effective treatment for elbow tendinopathy. NoneA systematic review of intra-articular PRP injection for cartilage repair has shown safety in humans with potential pain reduction and improved function. NoneLonger term follow-up is required before it can be recommended for OA therapy. NoneAfter chemical induction of OA in rat knee joints, Mifune et alNonecompared MDSCs expressing bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP-4) and sFlt-1 with and without PRP. Improved articular cartilage repair was seen at 4 and 12 weeks with the addition of PRP. Hyaluronic acid, a glycosaminoglycan extracellular matrix constituent, has been used for human OA with MRI evaluation up to 24 months showing beneficial effects on cartilage preservation. NoneMultiple animal studies have shown the combined use of stem cells and HA to produce better results than HA alone. None,None,None,NoneFollowing in vitro expansion, stem cells may be induced via transforming growth factor-beta1 or BMP-2 to undergo chondrogenic differentiationNone,Noneor can be uninduced. None,NoneEncouraging results have been achieved with both approaches compared with controls. None,NoneComparing induced with uninduced cells in animal studies shows mixed results. None,NoneIn vitro manipulation creates the opportunity for infection, necessitating antibiotic administration above the minimum inhibitory concentration for relevant organisms while not impeding MSC proliferation and differentiation. NoneMalignancy has been flagged as a potential risk of MSC implantation but has not yet been shown in clinical practice. None,None,NoneMiura et alNonefound that fibrosarcoma developed from murine BM-MSCs after numerous in vitro passages. Tolar et alNonealso identified sarcomatous transformation from mouse BM-MSCs expanded in vitro. In 2005, Rubio et alNonereported that after long-term in vitro culture of 4 to 5 months, human ADSCs exhibited malignant transformation. The group retracted this article in 2010, unable to reproduce the findings, proposing potential cross-contamination. NoneAnother group described spontaneous transformation of BM-MSCs due to cross-contamination by immortalized cell lines, emphasizing the need for DNA fingerprinting. None,NoneBernardo et alNonefound that human BM-MSCs did not demonstrate malignant transformation after long-term culture, showing telomeric shortening with progressive decline in proliferation until reaching senescence. Cell therapy represents promising treatment for many conditions, including joint disorders. The most widely practiced form, ACI and its newer variants, is capable of promoting cartilage repair and providing clinical benefit, although there is insufficient evidence to recommend these procedures over marrow stimulation techniques and osteochondral grafting. NoneOnly limited human data exist for use of MSCs, but both surgical implantation and intra-articular injection appear to be safe and exhibit reasonable efficacy. There is currently a paucity of randomized human trials. Cell sources that do not require in vitro expansion, such as BMC or SVF, provide the opportunity for same day therapy by reducing the turnaround time from cell harvest to treatment. None,NoneIntra-articular injection offers a reduction in postoperative recovery time. None,None,NoneFor chondral injury, MSC therapy may improve symptom control through anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. NoneAt present, there is no conclusive evidence to recommend cell therapy over non-cell-based procedures, but both treatments appear to offer beneficial results. Non-stem cell therapy such as ACI, mosaicplasty, and microfracture at present possesses more clinical evidence than MSC treatments.
