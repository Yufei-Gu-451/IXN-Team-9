The potential therapeutic use of marijuana and related cannabinoids has led to a strong interest in developing compounds that can selectively target cannabinoid receptors but lack abuse liability (Izzoet al. 2009; Bisogno Di Marzo2010). Ironically, the development of such compounds by research laboratories across the world has provided clandestine chemists the framework from which to identify and synthesize potent drugs that mimic some of the psychoactive effects of Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta9-THC). Consequently, there has been a global surge in the nonmedical use of synthetic cannabimimetic substances, marketed as 'herbal incense' and commonly known as 'Spice' (Loganet al. 2012; Lewinet al. 2014). Unlike the comparatively modest psychoactive and euphoric effects of marijuana, the use of Spice and related compounds has resulted in reports of severe anxiety, tachycardia, seizures and hallucinations (Schneiret al. 2011; Harris Brown2013). Nearly all of the identified chemical constituents of synthetic marijuana act as agonists at cannabinoid CB1 receptors (CB1Rs), and the psychoactive compounds in these preparations are frequently modified in response to legislative control imposed upon existing chemical structures (Vardakouet al. 2010; Seelyet al. 2012). The structures of three of the most popular synthetic cannabinoids and their appearance in the National Forensic Laboratory Information System database are depicted in Fig. 1. The National Forensic Laboratory Information System data reflect the prevalence of particular synthetic cannabinoids that were confiscated by local, state and federal law enforcement. The naphthoylindole JWH-018 (Fig. 1b) appeared frequently in Spice products confiscated during the years 2010 and 2011 in the United States but was rapidly supplanted by its fluoropentyl analog AM2201 (Fig. 1c; Seelyet al. 2013). In the first half of 2013, the tetramethylcyclopropyl indole XLR-11 (Fig. 1d) became much more prevalent than JWH-018 or AM2201 (U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration Office of Diversion2013), and this trend continued in 2014. Given the greater use of these synthetic marijuana preparations to avoid drug screen detection for Delta9-THC, and increasing public health concerns regarding these compounds, there is a need to more fully characterize the neurobiological actions of these synthetic cannabinoids (Seelyet al. 2012; Castanetoet al. 2014). Chemical structure of the compounds tested in this study. (a) Delta9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), (b) JWH-018, (c) AM2201 and (d) XLR-11. Lower panel shows the total number of reports of the tested Spice compounds from the US National Forensic Laboratory Information System (NFLIS). Note the decline in reports of AM2201 and JWH-018 and the marked rise in reports of XLR-11 between 2012 and 2013. [Colour figure can be viewed athttp://wileyonlinelibrary.com]Among the best characterized effects of cannabinoids is the inhibition of neurotransmitter release from axon terminals via CB1R activation (Alger2002; Hoffman Lupica2013). The cognitive deficits reported following acute or repeated use of marijuana (Abel1970; Bollaet al. 2002) may reflect the effects of Delta9-THC at CB1Rs located on both glutamatergic and GABAergic axon terminals in the hippocampus (Hajoset al. 2000; Sullivan2000; Hoffmanet al. 2007; Puighermanalet al. 2009). Most physiological studies have utilized synthetic agonists, such as WIN55212-2 and CP55,940, to evaluate the central actions of cannabinoids (Hoffman Lupica2000; Robbeet al. 2001; Holderithet al. 2011), and relatively few studies have examined the effects of Delta9-THC at central synapsesin vitro, owing to its poor solubility and penetration into brain slices (Laariset al. 2010; Hoffman Lupica2013). JWH-018 has been evaluated in cultured hippocampal neurons (Atwoodet al. 2010), and other Spice compounds have only recently been studied in pre-clinical models (Atwoodet al. 2011; Basavarajappa Subbanna2014). In this report, we directly compare the actions of JWH-018, AM2201 and XLR-11 with those induced by Delta9-THC at hippocampal glutamatergic synapses. All studies utilized 4-to 6 week-old male wildtype C57BL6 mice or CB1+/+and CB1-/-mice bred on a C57BL6 background. Prior to initiating experimental work, studies were approved by the NIDA IRP Animal Care and Use Committee, in accordance with NIH guidelines. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and euthanized by decapitation. The brain was removed and placed in a beaker containing a modified ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) containing, in millimolar,N-methyl-d-glucamine, 93; KCl, 2.5; NaH2PO4, 1.2; NaHCO3, 30; HEPES, 20; glucose, 25; sodium pyruvate, 3; MgCl2, 10; CaCl2, 0.5; and ascorbic acid, 5. Brain tissue was blocked and glued to the stage of a vibrating tissue slicer (Leica VT1200S, Leica Biosystems Nussloch, Germany) and submerged in modified aCSF. Transverse hippocampal slices (280 um) were obtained and stored in standard aCSF containing, in millimolar, NaCl, 126; KCl, 3; CaCl2, 2.4; MgCl2, 1.5; NaH2PO4, 1.2; NaHCO3, 26; and glucose, 11. Slices were warmed in aCSF for 20-25 minutes at 35 degrees C immediately after cutting and then allowed to gradually equilibrate to room temperature for at least 45 minutes prior to initiating recording. All solutions were oxygenated with 95% O2/5% CO2. We have previously found that endogenous adenosine can disrupt CB1R-mediated inhibition of glutamate release in the hippocampus (Hoffmanet al. 2010). Therefore, the selective adenosine A1receptor antagonist, 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX, 200 nM), was included in the aCSF throughout incubation and recordings. On average, three to four slices were used from a single animal per day. All drugs were tested in slices obtained from at least two subjects. Brain slices containing the hippocampus were submerged in aCSF in a slice chamber (RC-26, Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT, USA) and continuously perfused with aCSF (2 ml/minute) using a peristaltic pump (Cole-Parmer Instruments, Vernon Hills, IL, USA). Bath temperature was maintained at 30-32 degrees C using an in-line solution heater (TC324-C and SH27-B, Warner Instruments). Borosilicate glass electrodes (1.5 mm o.d. * 0.86 mm i.d., Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA, USA) were fabricated using a horizontal puller (P-97, Sutter Instruments) and filled with aCSF. Electrodes were connected to the headstage of an AC amplifier (Model 1800, A-M Systems, Sequim, WA, USA). Under stereomicroscopic visualization, a bipolar-stimulating electrode consisting of twisted formvar-insulated nichrome wire (50 um; A-M Systems) connected to a constant current stimulus isolation unit (DS3, Digitimer) was positioned in hippocampal area CA3 to activate Schaffer collateral fibers using 0.1-millisecond pulses. The recording electrode was manually positioned in CA1 stratum radiatum using a micromanipulator and gradually lowered while monitoring the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) response. Once the optimal position was determined, stimulus intensity was varied to produce an input-output curve. Baseline responses were then set by adjusting the stimulus intensity to achieve 30-50% of the maximum response. In some experiments, paired pulse stimuli were delivered at an interval of 50 milliseconds. Stimulation, data acquisition and signal analyses were performed on-line using an A/D board (PCIe-6321, National Instruments, Austin, TX, USA) and WinLTP software (http://www.win-ltp.com; Anderson Collingridge2007). Responses were obtained every 30 seconds, and drugs were applied after obtaining at least 10 minutes of stable baseline recording. High-frequency stimulation (HFS) consisted of three consecutive 100-Hz, 1-second trains, delivered 10 seconds apart. A three-way valve was used to switch between control aCSF and drug-containing aCSF. In most cases, drugs were applied for 40-60 minutes. To maintain consistent exposure times to cannabinoid agonists in long-term potentiation (LTP) experiments, brain slices were pre-treated for 90 minutes in the holding chamber (Collinset al. 1994,1995). Thereafter, recordings were performed in either standard aCSF or aCSF containing the CB1 antagonist PIMSR1 ((5-(4-Chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-3-[(E)-piperidinoiminomethyl]-1H-pyrazole)). The perfusion apparatus was washed with ethanol for 10-15 minutes between recordings. 1-Pentyl-3-(1-naphthoyl)-indole (JWH-018), (1-(5-fluoropentyl)-1H-indol-3-yl)(naphthalen-1-yl)methanone (AM-2201) and (1-(5-fluoropentyl)-1H-indol-3-yl)(2,2,3,3-tetramethylcyclopropyl)methanone (XLR-11) were supplied as dry powders by NIDA Drug Supply Program (Rockville, MD, USA). Stock solutions (1-10 mM) were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide and frozen at -20 degrees C until thawed for experiments. Delta9-THC (200 mg/ml in EtOH) was provided through NIDA Drug Supply and was diluted to 10 mM in dimethyl sulfoxide. PIMSR1 was generously provided by Dr Herbert Seltzman (Research Triangle International, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA). AM251 and DPCPX were purchased from Tocris (Minneapolis, MN, USA). All drugs were dissolved to their final concentration in aCSF prior to each experiment. All other reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Data are presented as mean +/- standard error of the mean. Comparisons were made usingt-tests or ANOVA where appropriate, with a critical value for statistical significance set atP less than 0.05. A Holm-Sidak's multiple comparisons test was used to measure the mean level of LTP between 55 and 60 minutes following HFS. Drug responses were defined as the change in the fEPSP slope at the time of the peak drug effect, typically 40 or 60 minutes after drug application. Prior experiments with cannabinoids have established that the relatively long drug onset time reflects partitioning of these highly lipophilic molecules into the brain slice. Responses were normalized to the baseline recording period. Dose-response curves were generated using a three-parameter, global curve fitting nonlinear regression algorithm in Prism (GraphPad Scientific, San Diego, CA, USA):Nonewhere Bottom and Top represent the plateaus and EC50represents the agonist concentration that produces a response halfway between the top and bottom of the curve. The bottom was constrained to a value of 0. A global curve fit was first used to determine whether the top plateau differed among the family of curves (JWH-018, AM2201, Delta9-THC and XLR-11). An additional sum of squaresF-test revealed that the maximum plateaus did not significantly differ (F3,82 = 1.203,P = 0.3139). In addition, a one-way ANOVA revealed no significant differences in the maximal inhibition produced by each compound (F3,17 = 0.7656,P = 0.5289). Thus, the Top was allowed to be shared as a single value for all data sets, and the EC50values were calculated. The cannabinoids found in synthetic marijuana preparations are presumably used as substitutes for the phytocannabinoid Delta9-THC because they may mimic some of its pharmacological properties in the brain. Therefore, we first defined the effects of Delta9-THC on excitatory synaptic transmission in the hippocampusin vitro. Glutamatergic fEPSPs, elicited by stimulation of Schaffer collateral axons, were recorded in area CA1 in transverse mouse hippocampal slices. Bath application of Delta9-THC caused a concentration-dependent reduction of fEPSP rising slope (Fig. 2a), and this was completely reversed by the neutral CB1 antagonist PIMSR1 (Hurstet al. 2006; Fig. 2b;n = 7, 99 +/- 4% of control,P = 0.9534, paired two-tailedt-test). The maximal inhibition of fEPSPs was 39 +/- 6% (n = 7), with an EC50of 707 nM (95% CI = 333-1053 nM). These effects of Delta9-THC are comparable with those obtained at GABAergic synapses in mouse hippocampus in our lab (EC501.2 muM, 43 +/- 2% maximal inhibition; Laariset al. 2010). Concentration-dependent inhibition of hippocampal glutamate release by Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).

(c) Concentration-response curve for Delta9-THC (n = 6-7 slices per concentration). The EC50(solid line) was calculated to be 707 nM. Dashed lines indicate the 95% confidence interval. [Colour figure can be viewed athttp://wileyonlinelibrary.com]Among the first generation of synthetic cannabinoid compounds isolated from confiscated synthetic marijuana products was JWH-018 (Uchiyamaet al. 2010; Wileyet al. 2014b). This compound was previously shown to inhibit glutamate release at hippocampal synapses in culture (Atwoodet al. 2010). Consistent with these results, JWH-018 inhibited fEPSPs in mouse brain slices (Fig. 3a), and its EC50(Fig. 3b; 14.0 nM; 95% CI = 6-35 nM) was remarkably similar to that observed in cultured hippocampal neurons (14.9 nM; Atwoodet al. 2010). The maximal inhibition was 46 +/- 7% (n = 5) at 100 nM, and this was fully reversed by PIMSR1 (Fig. 4c;n = 3, 97 +/- 6% of control,P = 0.184, two-tailed pairedt-test). Concentration-response curves at hippocampal CA1 synapses for the Spice constituents JWH-018, AM2201 and XLR-11. Left panels (a,c,e) show the time course of each compound at several concentrations; right panels (b,d,f) show concentration-response curves (n = 3-8 slices per concentration). The EC50(solid lines) and 95% confidence intervals (dashed lines) are indicated for each compound. (g) shows the curves replotted on the same graph to highlight the potency differences. Note that JWH-018 (orange trace) is the most potent compound in the series relative to Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) (black trace) and that XLR-11 is similar in potency to Delta9-THC. The table in (h) summarizes the mean calculated EC50 values and 95% confidence intervals for each of the tested compounds. [Colour figure can be viewed athttp://wileyonlinelibrary.com]AM2201 and JWH-018 act via CB1 receptors to inhibit glutamate release. (a) Time course of AM2201 (100 nM) and reversal by the CB1 antagonist/inverse agonist AM251 (n = 4). (b) Representative traces demonstrating the effects of AM2201 (200 nM) in slices from a wildtype (CB1+/+) and knockout (CB1-/-) mouse. The summary demonstrates the significant difference (***P less than 0.001,n = 6, two-tailed unpairedt-test) in the effects between wildtype and CB1-/- mice. In wildtype mice, AM2201 significantly enhanced the paired-pulse ratio (*P less than 0.05, two-tailed pairedt-test), whereas this effect was absent in CB1-/- mice (P = 0.1302, two-tailed pairedt-test). (c) Traces and mean time course (n = 3) demonstrating fEPSP inhibition by JWH-018 (100 nM) and its reversal by PIMSR1 (2 muM). [Colour figure can be viewed athttp://wileyonlinelibrary.com]Following the placement of JWH-018 on the US Drug Enforcement Agency Schedule I list in March 2011 (Drug Enforcement Administration, USA, Department of Justice2011), a second generation of synthetic cannabinoids began to appear in confiscated products. Among these, a fluoropentyl derivative of JWH-018 known as AM2201 that binds to the CB1R with low nanomolar affinity (Deng Makriyannis2005) was detected in increasing amounts (Fig. 1). We observed that AM2201 also potently inhibited fEPSPs, with an EC50slightly higher than JWH-018 (Fig. 3c,g; 59 nM; 95% CI = 24-145 nM), and generated a maximal inhibition of 53 +/- 7% at 200 nM (n = 6; Fig. 3d). Consistent with a presynaptic site of action, AM2201 significantly enhanced the paired pulse ratio in response to paired stimuli (Fig. 4b;n = 6,P = 0.01, two-tailed pairedt-test). The effect of AM2201 was reversed by bath application of the CB1R antagonist/inverse agonist AM251 (Fig. 4a;n = 4, 118 +/- 18% of control,P = 0.3825, two-tailed pairedt-test), and it had no effect on glutamate release in slices obtained from CB1R knockout mice (Fig. 4b;n = 6,P less than 0.001,t = 6.246, d.f. = 10, unpairedt-test versus control). By the end of the year 2012, a new designer cannabinoid-like compound was increasingly isolated from confiscated synthetic marijuana products. This synthetic compound was structurally novel and referred to as XLR-11 [(1-(5-fluoropentyl)-1H-indol-3-yl)(2,2,3,3-tetramethylcyclopropyl)methanone] (Seelyet al. 2013; U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration Office of Diversion2013). When the effect of XLR-11 on glutamatergic fEPSPs was examined, we found that it inhibited these responses with a lower potency than JWH-018 or AM-2201 (Fig. 3e,f; EC50 = 933 nM; 95% CI = 0.38-2.3 muM). Moreover, XLR-11 exhibited a trend toward a lower degree of maximal inhibition of fEPSPs compared with these other synthetic cannabinoids (Fig. 3f,g, maximal inhibition = 41 +/- 2% at 2 muM;n = 4). The inhibition of the response produced by XLR-11 was also blocked by pre-treatment of slices with 5 muM PIMSR1 indicating a role for CB1Rs in this response (n = 9, 95 +/- 3% of control,P = 0.02,t = 2.348, d.f. = 20 versus 5 muM XLR-11 alone). The deleterious effects of cannabinoids on learning and memory are well established in humans (Abel1970) and in animal models (Wiseet al. 2009; Hanet al. 2012). It is hypothesized that the ability of cannabinoid agonists to impair hippocampal long-term potentiation may play a role in the cognitive impairments produced by these drugs (Misner Sullivan1999; Hoffmanet al. 2007; Abush Akirav2010; Basavarajappa Subbanna2014; Navakkode Korte2014). We therefore evaluated the effects of the synthetic cannabinoids on hippocampal LTP and compared these effects with those of Delta9-THC. In untreated, control slices (n = 16), delivery of HFS (3 * 100-Hz trains) resulted in reliable, stable potentiation of fEPSP slopes (Fig. 5a and b; 143 +/- 7% of baseline). In contrast, LTP was absent in slices incubated for 90 minutes in 200 nM JWH-018 (Fig. 5a and b;n = 11, 90 +/- 7% of baseline,P = 0.0003 versus control). This ability of JWH-018 to block LTP was prevented in another group of slices when the agonist treatment was followed by application of the CB1R antagonist PIMSR1 (2 muM), beginning 30 minutes prior to HFS (Fig. 5a and b;n = 5, 127 +/- 19% of baseline,P = 0.3320 versus control). As shown in Fig. 5b, slices incubated for 90 minutes with AM-2201 (200 nM;n = 11), XLR-11 (1 muM;n = 14) or Delta9-THC (1 muM;n = 13) also showed significantly reduced LTP (AM2201, 105 +/- 12% of baseline,P = 0.0076 versus control; XLR-11, 103 +/- 8% of baseline,P = 0.0035 versus control; Delta9-THC, 118 +/- 7% of baseline,P = 0.0416 versus control). Together, these results suggest that, in addition to their ability to acutely depress glutamatergic transmission, the synthetic cannabinoids present in 'Spice' preparations also limit synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. Disruption of hippocampal LTP by synthetic cannabinoids. (a) Representative traces from a control (untreated) slice, a slice pre-treated for 90 minutes with JWH-018 (0.2 muM) and a slice pre-treated with JWH-018, followed by 2 muM PIMSR1.

(b) Average LTP observed in control slices and slices pre-treated with agonists at the indicated concentrations. The numbers of slices are indicated in parentheses. A one-way ANOVA detected significant differences (F(5,64) = 4.51,P = 0.001) among the treatment groups. *P less than 0.05, **P less than 0.01, ***P less than 0.001 versus control; Holm-Sidak multiple comparisons test. [Colour figure can be viewed athttp://wileyonlinelibrary.com]The present study compares the effects of several synthetic cannabinoids recently identified in psychoactive Spice formulations, using a functional synaptic response in a brain area relevant to the cognitive effects of marijuana. Importantly, our studies involved direct comparisons of these synthetic cannabinoids with Delta9-THC, the primary psychoactive active cannabinoid in marijuana. All of the cannabinoid molecules dose-dependently suppressed hippocampal synaptic glutamate release, with the following relative order of potency: JWH-018 greater than AM2201 greater than greater than Delta9-THC greater than XLR-11, and the effects of all compounds were blocked by the selective CB1R antagonists AM251 or PIMSR1, consistent with the expression of CB1Rs on hippocampal glutamate axon terminals (Kawamuraet al. 2006). The potency of JWH-018 is also in agreement with a previous report obtained in cultured hippocampal neurons (Atwoodet al. 2010). The high potency of JWH-018 and AM2201 in inhibiting the synaptic response is consistent with the high affinity of these compounds at CB1Rs previously reported in receptor binding assays (KNone = 9 and 1 nM, respectively; Carrollet al. 2012), as well as with the ability of low doses of these compounds to substitute for Delta9-THC in drug discrimination assays (Baumannet al. 2014; Jarbe Gifford2014; Wileyet al. 2014a). XLR-11 is structurally distinct from JWH-018 and AM2201, having been derived from a series of cyclopropylindoles synthesized for potential use as cannabinoid 2 receptor agonists (Frostet al. 2010). This compound, which is emerging as a major component of Spice-related substances (U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration Office of Diversion2013), has been reported to bind to CB1Rs, with slightly greater affinity than Delta9-THC, and to also substitute for Delta9-THC in a mouse drug discrimination paradigm (Wileyet al. 2013). Our results suggest that XLR-11 is nearly equivalent to Delta9-THC at inhibiting glutamate release via CB1Rs but that both compounds are far less potent than the synthetic constituents found in earlier synthetic marijuana formulations. Based on these observations, it is tempting to speculate that the adverse physiological and psychological effects often associated with use of synthetic marijuana formulated with higher-affinity CB1R agonists (Winstock Barratt2013) may be driving the demand for a synthetic drug with properties closer to those of Delta9-THC. Correspondingly, the incidence of adverse reactions may be smaller with lower-affinity synthetic cannabinoids. Despite the differences in potency among the compounds tested, we did not observe statistically significant differences in the maximum inhibition (efficacy) of glutamatergic synaptic transmission. This was surprising for Delta9-THC, because previous studies have suggested that it is a partial agonist at CB1Rs in G-protein activation assays (Simet al. 1996; Burkeyet al. 1997) and at inhibition of synaptic responses in cultured hippocampal neurons (Shen Thayer1999; Straiker Mackie2005). Interestingly, the study by Shen and Thayer reported that Delta9-THC suppressed excitatory transmission by ~60% (Shen Thayer1999), which is typically the maximum inhibition seen by cannabinoid agonistsin vitroand is greater than the effect observed in the present study. We have previously demonstrated that Delta9-THC displays full agonist properties at CB1Rs on hippocampal GABAergic terminals (Laariset al. 2010). However, because tonic adenosine levels limit Delta9-THC effects at hippocampal glutamatergic, but not GABAergic synapses (Hoffmanet al. 2010), all of the present studies were performed in the presence of the adenosine A1 receptor antagonist DPCPX. It is therefore possible that these conditions permitted us to observe more robust and reliable inhibition of excitatory transmission by Delta9-THC. Together, our results suggest that these compounds primarily differ from Delta9-THC in terms of their relative potency at CB1Rs expressed on hippocampal glutamatergic terminals, rather than in their maximum efficacy. The ability of synthetic cannabinoids to inhibit neurotransmitter release in the hippocampus likely has consequences for cognitive function. Prior studies have demonstrated that JWH-018 (Comptonet al. 2012) and the related naphthoylindole JWH-081 (Basavarajappa Subbanna2014) disrupt spatial learning in rodents. In the present study, all of the drugs tested, including Delta9-THC, suppressed glutamatergic transmission to a similar extent and significantly reduced hippocampal LTP. This is consistent with prior work demonstrating cannabinoid-mediated inhibition of synaptic plasticity bothin vivo(Abush Akirav2010) andin vitro(Basavarajappa Subbanna2014; Collinset al. 1994; Misner Sullivan1999; Navakkode Korte2014). In our studies, slices were exposed to each agonist for 90 minutes, followed by evaluation of LTP in agonist-free aCSF. This was performed in order to standardize the exposure time to the agonists, similar to previous studies (Collinset al. 1994,1995). The slow-onset time of these agonists to inhibit glutamatergic transmission, coupled with the limited washout of these lipophilic compounds, suggests that they were present in the tissue during the recordings. Consistent with this, PIMSR1 prevented the effect of JWH-018 on LTP when applied immediately following the 90-minute pre-treatment period and 30 minutes prior to HFS. Thus, the most parsimonious explanation of our data is that reduced LTP reflects ongoing suppression of glutamatergic transmission by actions of these compounds at CB1Rs. Indeed, this is the general mechanism through which other CB1 agonists have been demonstrated to block LTP (Collinset al. 1994,1995; Misner Sullivan1999; Sullivan2000). The ability of these and other Spice compounds to disrupt hippocampal LTP is likely to have important consequences for learning and memory (Pastalkovaet al. 2006; Whitlocket al. 2006; Comptonet al. 2012; Basavarajappa Subbanna2014). We have previously demonstrated that repeated exposure to Delta9-THC disrupts hippocampal LTP and alters signaling at both glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses (Hoffmanet al. 2007). Although we have not yet examined the effects of these compounds on GABAergic axon terminals in the hippocampus, where CB1Rs are also widely expressed (Katonaet al. 1999; Hoffman Lupica2000; Dudoket al. 2014), the expected inhibition of GABAergic function likely also contributes to disrupted network activity in the hippocampus, leading to deficits in cognitive function (Hajoset al. 2000; Puighermanalet al. 2009). In addition, it is possible that thein vivoeffects of these compounds will reflect the activity of both the parent compound and its metabolites, several of which retain strong biological activity at CB1Rs (Brentset al. 2011; Fantegrossiet al. 2014). Overall, the present findings demonstrate that synthetic cannabinoids most often found in psychoactive synthetic marijuana products have profound effects on hippocampal neurotransmission and are much more potent than Delta9-THC at activating CB1Rs. This much higher affinity for CB1Rs by synthetic cannabinoids, as compared with Delta9-THC, is likely to prolong the period in which this receptor is activated, thereby extending the duration of behavioral and psychological effects of these drugs. As CB1Rs are ubiquitously expressed in the human brain and extensively engaged by these agonists, the notion that synthetic cannabinoids are benign versions of naturally occurring marijuana is not supported. Given the continued widespread use of these marijuana-like products, especially by young people, future studies are warranted to elucidate the acute and chronic effects of synthetic cannabinoids on mood, learning and memory, and other physiological processes across development.
