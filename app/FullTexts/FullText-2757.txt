Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumours (RECIST) were introduced in 2000 to provide a standardized method for assessing response to treatments[None]. The RECIST Working Group has updated RECIST to Version 1.1[None]. The revised version has maintained assessment of tumour burden using the sum of the diameters and continues to use uni-dimensional measurements. The response categories are still complete response, partial response (30% decrease in sum from baseline), stable disease and progressive disease (20% increase in sum from nadir). The revisions address issues that have arisen related to the use of the criteria in clinical practice. Table 1outlines the main changes. NoneNoneNone greater than =10 mm in longest diameter (LD) for spiral CT (nodal and extranodal lesions)Ultrasound (US) may be an alternative to clinical measurement of superficial nodes or nodules greater than =10 mm in LD and 2 time the slice thickness for extra-nodal lesions greater than =15 mm in short axis diameter (SAD) for nodal lesionsUS cannot be used to measure lesionsLymph nodes are considered abnormal enlarged if SAD greater than 10 mmNon-measurable nodal lesions SAD >10 mm and less than 15 mmThe sum of the diameters (LD for extra-nodal target lesions and SAD for nodal lesions) is followed through treatmentPD occurs if the sum of the longest diameters increases by greater than =20% from nadirPD occurs if there is "unequivocal progression" of existing non-target lesionsPD occurs if the sum of the diameters has increased by greater than =20% and greater than =5 mm from nadirPatients with measurable disease for "unequivocal progression" based on non-target disease, there must be an overall substantial worsening that merits discontinuation of therapy (if target disease is SD/PR)Patients without measurable disease for "unequivocal progression" of non-target disease, the increase in overall tumour burden must be comparable to the increase needed for PD of measurable diseaseNew lesions can be assessed using FDG/PETPET negative at baseline and positive at follow-up is PD based on a new lesionNo PET at baseline and positive PET at follow-up is PD if the new lesion is confirmed on CTNo PET at baseline and positive PET at follow-up corresponding to a pre-existing lesion on CT that is not progressing is not PDOne overall response table integrates target, non-target and new lesionsAnother table integrates non-target and new lesions for the assessment of subjects without measurable diseaseTable modified from:http://www.corelabpartners.com/CoreLabPartners/media/Corelab/RECIST-Guide_122011web.pdf
