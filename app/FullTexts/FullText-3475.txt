Diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy, two important microvascular complications of diabetes, are the main causes of morbidity and mortality among diabetic patients (1). Diabetic nephropathy is the most common cause of chronic kidney failure and end-stage renal disease, whereas diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness in the adults (2,3). With the significant rise in the prevalence of diabetes, the increase of patients suffering from diabetic microvascular complications will be inevitable worldwide. Although diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy are clearly associated with the duration of diabetes and glycemic control (4), some patients develop severe complications despite well-controlled blood glucose. Conversely, not all diabetic patients with poor glycemic control develop advanced renal or retinal complications. The underlying mechanism of how these diabetic microvascular complications occur remains largely unknown, but family studies in Pima Indian and European descent populations suggest genetic factors participate in the development of these complications (5-7). However, the advance of susceptible gene identification in diabetic microvascular complications was much more limited than it was in type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Recently, a genome-wide association study using Genetics of Kidneys in Diabetes (GoKinD) samples identified four loci associated with diabetic nephropathy in the type 1 diabetic patients of European descent (8). Maeda et al. (9) further replicated the effect of one of them (rs1411766 nearIRS2) in the Japanese type 2 diabetic patients. However, although diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy are two diseases with a high concordance rate in diabetic patients and might share common pathogenesis, no study reported if these single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) had effects on diabetic retinopathy after stratification of the status of diabetic nephropathy. In this study, we aimed to test the effects of SNPs from these four loci on the diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy in Chinese type 2 diabetic patients. We used a two-stage approach for this study. In stage 1, we recruited 1,276 type 2 diabetic patients from the Shanghai Diabetes Institute Inpatient Database of Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital (10,11) and examined them for diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy. These patients included 378 individuals with diabetic nephropathy but no retinopathy, 374 with diabetic retinopathy but no nephropathy, 244 with both diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy, and 280 control subjects. The control subjects were defined as having normoalbuminuria, no retinopathy, and having diabetes for greater than 10 years. In stage 2, we recruited 590 type 2 diabetic patients from the Shanghai Diabetic Complications Study (12) and Shanghai Diabetes Institute Inpatient Database, including 209 patients with diabetic retinopathy and 381 patients with diabetes for greater than 5 years and without retinopathy. The basic characteristics of the study population were shown inTable 1. Clinical characteristic of the participantsData aren, means +/- SD, or medians (interquartile range). eGFR, estimated glomerular filtration rate. *eGFR was calculated by using the formula developed by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease study group with adjustment for the Chinese ethnicity. This study was approved by the institutional review board of Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital and in accordance with the principle of the Helsinki Declaration II. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant. -1.154* (age in years)-0.203* (0.742 if female) * (1.233 if Chinese) (13). Fundus photography was performed following a standardized protocol at the Department of Ophthalmology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital. Both eyes of each participant were photographed with a 45-degree 6.3-megapixel digital nonmydriatic camera (Canon CR6-45NM, Lake Success, NY). Level of retinopathy was defined according to the International Classification of Diabetic Retinopathy (14): mild nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy, moderate nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy, severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy, or proliferative diabetic retinopathy. The worse eye was recorded for each patient. In stage 1, we genotyped 55 tagging SNPs that capture 95% of the common variants, including one reported SNP from each locus (CPVL/CHN2rs39059,FRMD3rs10868025,CARSrs451041, andIRS2rs1411766). The SNPs showed associations to diabetic nephropathy or retinopathy and were genotyped in stage 2 samples. The genotyping was performed by using primer extension of multiplex products with detection by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization - time of flight mass spectroscopy using a MassARRAY Compact Analyzer (Sequenom, San Diego, CA). The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test was performed before the association analysis. The allelic frequencies between the diabetic patients with or without complications were compared by chi2tests using PLINK (v1.07) (15), and odd ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs were presented. Combined ORs from different studies were calculated by using a Comprehensive Meta Analysis (v2.2.057) with a fixed- or random-effect model after testing for heterogeneity. The test for homogeneity was assessed by the CochranQtest. The genotype-disease association analyses were performed under the additive model by logistic regression with adjustment of confounding factors. The effects of SNPs on the levels of retinopathy severity were analyzed by trend analysis. Skewly distributed quantitative traits (estimated glomerular filtration rate and AER) were logarithmically transformed to approximate univariate normality before analysis. Quantitative traits were analyzed by linear regression with adjustment of confounding factors under an additive genetic model. The statistical analyses were performed using SAS for Windows (version 8.0; SAS Institute, Cary, NC) unless specified otherwise. A two-tailedPvalue of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. On the basis of the previously reported effect size of these loci (?1.40) (8), our stage 1 samples (?600 case subjects vs. 600 control subjects) had greater than 90% power to replicate the reported effects of SNPs with minor allele frequencies greater than 0.2 and 75% power to replicate the effect SNP with minor allele frequency of 0.1 at a level of significance of 0.05. We firstly analyzed the effects of these SNPs on diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy in stage 1 samples (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). As shown inTable 2, fourCPVL/CHN2SNPs (rs39059, rs17756941, rs245955, and rs245962) andFRDM3rs10868025 were nominally associated with diabetic retinopathy (P less than 0.05), with rs39059 and rs10868025 showing the strongest association within each locus (OR 0.774, 95% CI 0.657-0.912,P= 0.002, for rs39059 G allele; 0.833, 0.703-0.987,P= 0.034, for rs10868025 G allele). However, none of the genotyped SNPs showed a significant association to diabetic nephropathy. Effects of the SNPs on diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy in stage 1 samplesPvalues less than 0.05 are shown in boldface. ORs with 95% CIs were calculated for the minor allele. To further validate the effects of rs39059 and rs10868025 on diabetic retinopathy, we genotyped both SNPs in stage 2 samples. We found onlyCPVL/CHN2rs39059 showed similar effects to diabetic retinopathy, as identified in the first stage (OR 1.269, 95% CI 0.989-1.628,P= 0.061, for rs39059; 1.014, 0.789-1.302,P= 0.9147, for rs10868025). We then performed a meta-analysis with the fixed-effect model and found rs39059 was associated with diabetic retinopathy, with an OR of 1.285 (1.120-1.474,P= 0.0003) (Table 3). This association remained significant after adjusting confounding factors, including hemoglobin A1clevels, duration of diabetes, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and BMI (OR 1.242, 1.074-1.437,P= 0.0034). Association of rs39059 inCPVL/CHN2with diabetic retinopathy in Chinese type 2 diabetic patients*ORs with 95% CIs were shown for risk allele. Pvalues of meta-analysis were calculated using the fixed-effect model; homogeneity testP= 0.932. We then analyzed the effects ofCPVL/CHN2rs39059 on the disease severity of diabetic retinopathy in all the samples. As shown inFig. 1,CPVL/CHN2rs39059 showed an association to the levels of diabetic retinopathy, with the risk allele more frequent in the more severe retinopathy patients (P= 0.0007 for trend analysis).

In the current study, we analyzed the effects of SNPs from four loci on diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy in Chinese type 2 diabetic patients. We first reported thatCPVL/CHN2rs39059 was associated with diabetic retinopathy. Although the association we observed was solid by replication in independent samples and thePvalue remained significant after Bonferroni correction of analysis on multiple SNPs (correctedP= 0.033, on the basis of the association analysis between 55 SNPs and two traits), we still cannot fully exclude the possibility that the association detected was false positive because of the relatively small sample size of this study. But considering we also found an association between rs39059 and disease severity in our samples, which supported the role of this locus in diabetic retinopathy from another aspect, the chance of a false-positive finding was limited. Although this locus was originally identified to be associated with diabetic nephropathy in a previous genome-wide association study (since the concordance rate of retinopathy and nephropathy was high in diabetic patients [16] and the genome-wide association study in the GoKinD samples (8) did not exclude the patients with retinopathy),CPVL/CHN2may be a susceptible locus of diabetic retinopathy other than nephropathy. However, whether this effect is restricted to type 2 diabetes is still unknown and needs to be investigated in studies with type 1 diabetic patients. The SNP rs39059 locates in the intron ofCHN2, which encodes beta-2 chimerin that have been shown to regulate cell growth, proliferation, and migration (17). Previous studies showed decreased expression ofCHN2is associated with high-grade malignant gliomas, breast cancer, and duodenal adenocarcinoma, whereas increased expression ofCHN2is reported to be associated with lymphomas (17,18). One other gene within the same haplotype block of rs39059 isCPVL. It encodes a carboxypeptidase that cleaves a single amino acid from the COOH termini of peptides (19). However, the function of this gene is still largely unknown. Although hemoglobin A1clevels and systolic blood pressure were also associated with diabetic retinopathy in our samples (P= 0.0065 for systolic blood pressure andP= 7.0 * 10-9for hemoglobin A1c), since rs39059 showed association to none of these traits (P= 0.5031 for systolic blood pressure andP= 0.1561 for hemoglobin A1c), our data suggest this locus did not participate in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy through the effects on blood pressure and glucose levels. Thus, the mechanism how this locus affected diabetic retinopathy susceptibility remains to be investigated. And the causal variant also remains to be identified by fine mapping studies. In this study, we failed to replicate the associations between these four loci and diabetic nephropathy in Chinese type 2 diabetic patients, although we had enough statistical power. Because we used a tagging SNP approach and captured most of the common variants within these loci, it was unlikely that causal variants were captured by different SNPs in different populations. One possible explanation may be the complicated phenotypes in type 2 diabetic patients. In our study, greater than 60% of the diabetic nephropathy patients also suffered from hypertension; although we statistically adjusted blood pressure as a confounding factor, the impact of hypertension cannot be ignored. In a previous replication study in Japanese type 2 diabetic patients, Maeda et al. (9) also failed to replicate the effects of most of these loci in four independent samples; thus, it is highly possible that the effects of these loci on diabetic nephropathy are restricted in the European descent population or type 1 diabetic patients. Further studies with type 1 diabetic patients are needed to confirm the effects of these loci. In summary, we foundCPVL/CHN2rs39059 was associated with diabetic retinopathy in Chinese type 2 diabetic patients. Further studies are needed to replicate this finding.
