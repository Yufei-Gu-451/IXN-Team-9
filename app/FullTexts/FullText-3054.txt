Local geometric properties of algebraic varieties are usually expressed by corresponding algebraic properties of the local rings. Sometimes these local rings are not "local enough", i.e., the Zariski topology is too coarse to offer sufficiently small neighbourhoods reflecting the desired geometric properties. In the case that one is working for example over the complex numbers, the Euclidean topology and the notion of analytic function give a refined tool to study the local geometry of a variety: the geometry is encoded in properties of the ring of local analytic functions. This cannot be carried out over arbitrary fields, though one may still speak of formal analytic functions. These are simply the elements of the completions of the local rings. But, whereas we could use analytic functions to define (locally) closed sets in the Euclidean topology, it does a priori not make sense to speak of sets defined by formal analytic functions. It becomes especially difficult to decide whether the set of all points on a variety where the ring of formal analytic functions fulfills some property is (Zariski) open or closed. The present notes show in the example of the "normal crossings locus" how one can overcome this difficulty. LetNonebe a variety (or more generally an arbitrary scheme) over an algebraically closed fieldNone, i.e., an integral separated scheme of finite type overNone, andNonea point. Denote the completion of the local ring ofNoneatNonebyNone. LetNonebe a property ofNone. What information can be gained on the setNoneof allNonesuch thatNonehas propertyNone? Such properties of the completion are for instance: being an integral domain, reduced, a principal ideal domain or being normal crossings. We will prove the following theorem in Section 4:NoneNoneThe normal crossings locusNoneof an algebraic varietyNoneis open inNone. In fact we will prove the above statement for hypersurfaces, a generalization to arbitrary varieties is straightforward. This result is well known to experts in resolution of singularities, but to the best of the authors' knowledge there is no reference for this in the above general setting. We emphasize that it is quite easy to prove this fact if a Euclidean topology (and thus a notion of analytic maps) is available. The main tools in our argumentation are etale neighbourhoods and Artin's celebrated approximation theorem [1]. A short introduction to both is given in Section 2. For a detailed treatment we refer to the literature, e.g. [5],[8]or [10]. The reasoning in the proof of the theorem is as follows: first prove a "global" version of the assertion, i.e., show that for a union of varieties the set of points where it isalgebraic normal crossings(also known assimple normal crossingsin the literature) is open; seeProposition 3. Next, translate the formal property of being normal crossings into the global property of being algebraic normal crossings. This uses etale neighbourhoods and the Artin Approximation Theorem. In a last step openness of the algebraic normal crossings locus in the etale neighbourhood is transferred to the original variety by openness of etale morphisms. The authors are indebted to an anonymous referee whose comments (e.g. Example 8) helped to improve the presentation. A basic but powerful tool in analysis and differential geometry is the inverse function theorem, which asserts that if the tangent map at a point is an isomorphism, so is the original map, at least in a sufficiently small neighbourhood of the point. Exactly the invertibility in a"small neighbourhood"causes troubles in algebraic geometry. The Zariski topology is much too coarse to allow an inverse function theorem; seeExample 2below. The notion ofetale neighbourhoodis a profitable tool to exploit morphisms which "would fulfill the assumptions of the inverse mapping theorem if considered overNone". LetNonebe an algebraically closed field of arbitrary characteristic. Denote byNonethe polynomial ring in the variablesNoneoverNone. Its completion w.r.t. the maximal idealNoneis the ring of formal power seriesNone. For an idealNonewe will denote byNonethe closed subscheme ofNonedefined byNone. By avariety overNonewe mean an integral separated scheme of finite type overNone. For a pointNoneof a schemeNonewith structure sheafNonewe writeNoneto denote its residue field, i.e., None,Nonethe maximal ideal of the local ring ofNoneatNone. LetNonebe a Noetherian scheme andNonea closed subscheme ofNonegiven by a sheaf of idealsNone. Theformal neighbourhoodNoneofNoneinNoneis the ringed space defined by the topological spaceNoneand the sheaf of ringsNone(see [5], II.9). IfNoneis affine andNoneis a closed point, then the formal neighbourhood ofNoneinNoneis the one point spaceNonetogether with the sheaf of rings given byNone, the completion of the local ringNonew.r.t. its maximal ideal. NoneNoneLetNoneandNone. The structure sheaf of the formal neighbourhood ofNonein 0 is given byNonewhich is not an integral domain. Indeed,Nonefactors inNoneasNoneTherefore the formal neighbourhood ofNonein 0 is reducible. LetNoneandNonebe varieties overNone. For a pointNonewe denote byNonethe(projectivized) tangent cone ofNoneatNone. It is the projective variety (overNone) associated to the graded algebra of the local ringNoneofNoneatNone:NonewhereNone. More explicitly, we may defineNonefor an affine varietyNonegiven by an idealNoneas follows: denote byNonethe ideal of initial forms of elements ofNone, where the initial form of an elementNoneis its homogeneous part of lowest degree. ThenNone. LetNoneandNonebe schemes. Recall that a morphism (resp. a morphism locally of finite type)Noneis calledflat(resp. unramified) if it is flat (resp. unramified) at all pointsNone. The morphismNoneis flat atNoneif the morphism of local ringsNoneis flat, i.e., the functorNonefromNone-modules toNone-modules is exact. Further,Noneis unramified atNoneifNoneis a finite separable field extension ofNone. In the affine case, i.e., Nonea ring homomorphism of finite type,Noneis unramified atNoneif and only ifNonegenerates the maximal ideal inNoneandNoneis a finite separable field extension ofNone. A morphismNoneis calledetaleif it is flat and unramified. It is calledetale atNoneif the induced morphism of local schemesNoneis etale. Especially, letNonebe a morphism of varieties such that the induced mapNoneis an isomorphism, thenNoneis etale atNoneif the induced map on the tangent conesNoneis an isomorphism. IfNoneis a regular closed point then the tangent cone agrees with the tangent space, and an etale morphism is a morphism whose tangent map is an isomorphism. Especially, ifNoneis etale we know thatNoneif and only ifNone. NoneNoneLetNoneandNonewithNoneinduced by the inclusionNone. Clearly, for anyNone-pointNonethe mapNonegives an isomorphism betweenNoneandNone, thus defines an etale map. Note that this is not the case for the pointNone. Note further that in the case ofNonewe may considerNoneandNoneas manifolds overNone. Then the implicit function theorem is applicable, and states thatNonecan (Euclidean) locally atNonebe parametrized by a neighbourhood ofNone. For the convenience of the reader we summarize some properties of etale (resp. flat and unramified) morphisms in the next proposition. Details, especially proofs, can be found for example in the excellent sources[5],[8]or[10]. NoneNoneLetNonebe schemes. For a pointNonewe denote byNoneits residue field, i.e.,None. NoneNoneNoneNoneA flat morphism of finite type between Noetherian schemes is open. IfNoneis locally of finite type, thenNoneis unramified if and only if the sheaf of relative differentials vanishes, i.e.,None. Open immersions, compositions of etale morphisms and any base changes of etale morphisms are etale. LetNonebe of finite type,Nonelocally Noetherian,NoneandNoneso thatNone. Moreover, letNonebe the canonical morphism. ThenNoneis etale (in some neighbourhood ofNone) if and only ifNoneis an isomorphism. The last assertion especially implies thatNone. Etale morphisms of varieties overNoneare morphisms which are local isomorphisms in the analytic sense; seeExample 2. Locally all etale morphisms are of the formNonewithNonea unit inNonefor some ringNone. This is equivalent toNonebeing flat and unramified (see[10], Cor. 3.16, and [11], III Section 5). Anetale neighbourhood of a pointNoneis a pairNoneconsisting of a schemeNoneand a pointNonewith an etale morphismNonesuch thatNone. NoneNoneLetNonebe the node in the plane with coordinate ringNoneClearlyNoneis irreducible and so isNone. In the formal neighbourhood of the origin the germ ofNoneis reducible (seeExample 1), sinceNoneIn the case ofNonethis factorization holds in a Euclidean neighbourhood of the origin, since the factors are algebraic power series, thus convergent (see [12], p. 106). Though we cannot obtain this decomposition in a Zariski open neighbourhood of 0, it will be possible in an etale neighbourhood. ConsiderNonewhereNoneand the canonical mapNoneinduced byNoneLet us denote the coordinate ring ofNonebyNone, and setNone. By the remark aboveNoneis etale if and only ifNoneis a unit inNone. ButNoneis a unit inNone, henceNone. ThusNoneis etale. OnNonethe polynomialNonefactors intoNoneandNone. ThereforeNoneis an etale neighbourhood which is reducible with two smooth branches intersecting transversally. The connected etale neighbourhoods ofNoneform a filtered system. Thelocal ringNoneofNoneatNonew.r.t. the etale topologyis defined asNonewhere the limit is taken over the system of connected etale neighbourhoodsNoneofNone. LetNonebe a local ring. It is calledHenselianw.r.t. Noneif it has the following property: ifNonewithNoneandNone, then there exists anNonewithNone. As usual,Nonedenotes the derivative ofNonew.r.t. None. TheHenselizationNoneofNoneis defined to be the smallest Henselian ring containingNone. More precisely this means that the ringNoneis Henselian, there is a local homomorphismNone, and any other local homomorphismNone, withNoneHenselian, factors throughNone. Important examples of Henselian rings are complete local rings. EspeciallyNone, the completion ofNonew.r.t. None, is Henselian. But it is not the smallest Henselian ring containingNone. In fact,NoneequalsNonethe ring ofalgebraic power series; see[2]. Recall that a power seriesNoneis called algebraic if there exists a non-zero polynomialNonewithNone. The local ring of a schemeNoneatNonew.r.t. the etale topology is the Henselization (w.r.t. None) of the local ring w.r.t. the Zariski topology:NoneFor further details, including proofs, see [10]. NoneNoneNote that the etale neighbourhoods are not the open sets of a topology, but take their part in aGrothendieck topology(see for example [4], I.2). Although it is not a "true" topology onNoneit is still enough to allow analogous constructions (like cohomology theories). Properties of formal and etale neighbourhoods are strongly related via the powerful Artin Approximation Theorem; see Thm. 1.10 in[1]:NoneNoneNoneLetNonebe a field or an excellent discrete valuation ring, and letNonebe the Henselization of aNone-algebraNoneof finite type at a prime ideal. LetNonebe a proper ideal ofNone. Given an arbitrary system of polynomial equations inNone,Nonewith coefficients inNone, a solutionNonein theNone-adic completionNoneofNone, and an integerNone, there exists a solutionNonewithNoneLetNonebe a finite union of algebraic varieties overNone. All properties which will be studied here are local, hence we may assume that all varieties are affine. In fact, we will consider mainly subvarieties of someNone,None. We say thatNoneis algebraic normal crossings(in shortanc)at a pointNoneif there are local coordinatesNoneatNonesuch thatNoneis locally atNonegiven byNonewithNone(in the literature this property is also referred to assimpleorstrict normal crossings, e.g. [7]). By"local coordinates"we mean a regular system of parameters for the local ringNone. We say thatNoneis normal crossings(in shortnc)atNoneifNoneis an algebraic normal crossings point forNone, i.e., if the formal germ ofNoneatNoneis defined byNone,None, whereNoneis a formal coordinate system atNone. Aformal coordinate systemis a regular system of parameters forNone. The locus of points in whichNoneis algebraic normal crossings (resp. normal crossings) is called thealgebraic normal crossings locus ofNone(resp. normal crossings locus ofNone) and will be denoted byNone(resp. None). NoneNoneThe hypersurfaceNoneis algebraic normal crossings, thus also normal crossings, at all points except the origin. The origin is not a normal crossings point. In contrast, the hypersurfaceNoneis irreducible, thus has no algebraic normal crossings points with more than one component (those with one component are precisely the smooth points). Its normal crossings locus isNone(seeFig. 1), which is open inNone. NoneNoneNoneNoneandNone. LetNonevanish atNone, i.e., None(where we writeNonefor the maximal ideal ofNone). Denotethe differential ofNoneatNone, i.e., the classNone, byNone. NoneNoneLetNonebe a union of hypersurfacesNone,None,None. ThenNoneis anc atNoneif and only ifNonefor allNoneand theNoneareNone-linearly independent. NoneNoneThe "if" part is obvious. For the other direction letNoneandNonefulfill the conditions above. Since theNoneareNone-linearly independent, theNonevanishing atNoneare part of a regular system of parameters ofNone(see[9], Thm. 14.2) from which the assertion follows immediately (see also [3]). ? NoneNoneThe algebraic normal crossings locus of a finite union of hypersurfaces is open. NoneNoneLetNonewhereNoneis the hypersurface defined byNone, and letNone. IfNonelies in the intersectionNoneof two hypersurfaces and is not an anc point ofNone, thenNoneis not an anc point ofNonefor anyNone. Define the following (Zariski) closed subsets ofNone. ForNone:NonewhereNonedenotes the ideal generated by allNone-minors of the matrixNoneand the union is taken over allNone-tuplesNonewith distinct entriesNone. Finally, setNone. ClearlyNoneis closed and contains byLemma 2all non-anc points. Conversely, no point ofNoneis an anc point. ThusNoneis open. ? NoneNoneFig. 2illustratesProposition 3. HereNoneis the union of three plane curves. NoneNoneNoneThe pointsNoneandNoneare not anc, butNoneandNoneare. As indicated in the Introduction we will deal in this section with questions of the following form: letNonebe a variety,Nonea point. Moreover, letNonebe a property of the formal neighbourhoodNone, e.g., normal crossings, reducible, .... Is the set of pointsNonefor whichNonehas propertyNoneopen (resp. closed or locally closed) in the Zariski topology? We will be able to solve this question with the techniques of Section 2for the normal crossings property (and some variation). We test the same procedure on two different examples. NoneNoneFor propertiesNonewhich we define only for closed points, we will view the corresponding setNoneas a subset of theNoneofNonewith the induced topology. As a first example we study the property of being normal crossings; see Section 3andTheorem 2below. NoneNoneThe normal crossings locusNoneof a hypersurfaceNoneis open inNone. NoneNoneNoneNoneLetNonebe a scheme defined by a not necessarily reduced polynomialNone. Analogous to the normal crossings locus ofNonewe ask for themonomial locusNoneofNone. This is the locus of pointsNoneso that there exist formal coordinatesNonewithNonefor some elementNone. Denote byNonethe reduced scheme associated toNone. ThenNone. Indeed, letNonebe the distinct irreducible factors ofNoneinNonedefining hypersurfacesNone. By definitionNoneis reduced. Since it is essentially of finite type (see [9], p. 232, 260), we conclude thatNoneis reduced. The same is true forNone. IfNonethen each irreducible component ofNonecorresponds to one of theNoneafter a change of coordinates. Therefore,NoneThe last theorem thus implies:(i) We first show that ifNoneis normal crossings atNone, then there exists an etale neighbourhoodNoneofNonesuch thatNoneis an algebraic normal crossings point ofNone. Without loss of generality we may assume thatNone. SinceNonethere existNone,None, building part of a regular system of parameters ofNonesuch thatNoneByTheorem 1there exists for anyNonean etale neighbourhoodNoneofNonewithNone,NoneonNoneandNone. Note thatNoneare regular onNone. By choosing the constantNoneofTheorem 1equal to 2 we can ensure that theNoneare part of a regular system of parameters ofNone. ThusNoneis algebraic normal crossings atNone. (ii) IfNoneis an algebraic normal crossings or normal crossings point, thenNoneis a normal crossings point ofNone. This follows immediately fromProposition 1, (4). (iii) By (i) every pointNonehas an etale neighbourhoodNoneso thatNoneis anc atNone. ByProposition 3we see thatNoneis open. Openness of etale maps (seeProposition 1, (1)) implies thatNoneis open, and so isNone ? NoneNoneLetNonebe a hypersurface inNonedefined by a not necessarily reduced polynomialNone. Then the monomial locusNoneofNoneis open inNone. LetNonebe a scheme,Nonea closed point. Denote byNone,Nonethe components ofNonepassing throughNone. ThenNoneis said to bemikado atNoneifNonefor allNoneandNone, whereNone. The locus of all mikado points ofNonewill be denoted byNone. Mikado points are of interest in resolution of singularities [6]. NoneNoneLetNoneandNone. Clearly,Noneis not mikado at 0, butNoneis; neither of them is normal crossings at the origin. In order to successfully apply the etale construction to consider the locus of "formally mikado points" in an irreducible scheme it will be necessary thatNoneis open inNone. The next example gives a counterexample:Noneis locally closed but not closed. In this way we can construct examples of schemes/varieties which have only constructibleNone, which is-in the algebraic category-the worst possible behavior. NoneNoneConsiderNone, which is a union of four hypersurfaces inNone. It is easy to see thatNone, which is locally closed inNonebut not open; seeFig. 3. NoneNoneNoneThe setNoneis locally closed but not open. LetNonebe a union of algebraic varieties (not necessarily hypersurfaces). We say thatNoneisirreducible (resp. formally irreducible) atNoneifNone(resp. None) is an integral domain. OtherwiseNoneis calledreducible (resp. formally reducible) atNone(for a more general notion of irreducibility and its relation with connectedness results see[13]). We denote the locus of irreducible resp. formally irreducibleNonebyNoneresp. None. Analogously we denote byNonethe complement ofNoneinNone. It is natural to try to prove an analogous result forNoneas forNonewith the same method of proof. LetNonebe a finite union of algebraic varietiesNone. ThenNoneis closed. This follows from the simple fact thatNoneThusNoneis open. Note thatNonewill in general contain points where one of theNoneis formally reducible. This causes troubles when trying to adapt the proof ofTheorem 2. Indeed, in step (iii) (using the notation introduced there) the setsNoneare useless for our purpose since they might contain formally reducible points. NoneNoneConsider the following varietyNone(with theNone-axis as its singular locus). It is formally reducible in all points of theNone-axis except the origin. Indeed, forNoneNonewhereNoneexists as a formal power series, andNoneis irreducible as an element ofNone. Therefore, the setNoneconsists ofNone, which is constructible but not open inNone.
