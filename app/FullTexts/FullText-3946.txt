With a 5-year survival rate of less than 5% for patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), the disease remains one of the most lethal malignancies primarily due to late diagnosis and ineffective chemo and radiation therapies (1). Recent identification of three distinct PDAC precursors - pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN), mucinous cystic neoplasm and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm - provides new hope for early detection and a much better understanding of the underlying mechanisms that are instrumental in the progression of the disease (2). Among these precursor lesions, PanINs are the best characterized (3). Indeed, a number of genetic mutations associated with PDAC have been detected in PanINs at various stages including mutations in theKRAS2, TP53andSMAD4genes which also are hallmarks of advanced PDAC, consistent with a PanIN - greater than PDAC step-wise progression model (2). These observations are further supported by genetically engineered mouse models where PanIN/PDAC progression is initiated by single point mutations in theKrasgene and modified by additional genetic alterations in other oncogenes or tumor suppressors (4-10). However, the molecular mechanisms that govern each step of PanIN/PDAC progression remain elusive. More controversial is the cellular origin of PDAC. PDAC has long been considered a disease of pancreatic ducts. Early efforts to model the disease by expressingKrasin pancreatic duct cells did not yield discenable pathology (11), although a recent study by Rayet al. (12) has shown that activation of endogenousKrasNonein large pancreatic ducts leads to rare early PanIN lesions. Despite this example, increasing evidence supports the idea that PanIN/PDAC can originate from differentiated acinar cells, which represent the major cellular component of the pancreas parenchyma (10,13-15). The development of duct-like PanIN lesions from acinar cells necessitates massive remodeling of these cells, both morphologically and with respect to gene expression profiles. The transition from acinar to ductal cell properties has been termed acinar-ductal metaplasia (ADM) and lineage-tracing studies have confirmed that this process results from direct transdifferentiation of adult acinar cells that convert to a duct cell phenotype uponKrasNoneexpression (10,13,16). The relevance of ADM to PDAC is also supported by the observation that ADM is frequently associated with human PanIN lesions from PDAC patients (17,18). Additionally, ADM development has been shown to precede PanIN formation in mouseKrasNonemodels (17), suggesting that ADM represents the initial stage of PDAC development. Although it is clear thatKrasNoneexpression in adult acinar cells can generate ADM lesions that progress to PanINs and PDAC, the molecular signaling pathways that are instrumental in these conversion events remain poorly defined. Indeed,KrasNoneexpression alone does not guarantee ADM/PanIN development because in mouse PDAC models where ~95% of acinar cells expressKrasNoneonly a small cohort of cells generate detectable ADM/PanINs after a significant latent period (months), demonstrating that differentiated acinar cells are not universally responsive to KRAS signaling. This observation is compounded by the complexity of following ADM/PanIN development within the context of the intact organ. In an effort to develop anin vitrosystem to study the very earliest events of ADM formation, we focused on the initial transition of acinar cells converting to ductal cells uponKrasNoneexpression in a 3D culture model. We found thatKrasNone-expressing acinar cells in 3D culture rapidly converted to ductal cells that mimicked properties associated within vivoADM and PanIN lesions, including silencing of acinar genes and expression of duct genes. Analysis of RAS signaling components demonstrated that activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway was essential forKrasNone-induced ADM. Furthermore, the ability of acinar cells to undergo a transdifferentiation process to ductal cells was significantly attenuated by forced expression of the acinar-restricted transcription factorMist1, suggesting that maintaining acinar cell identity mitigates the strong oncogenic potential ofKrasNoneexpression. These results provide possible new therapeutic approaches to treat early ADM/PanIN cases by simultaneously targeting the MAPK pathway andMist1transcriptional networks. Krasmutations are virtually universal in human PDAC, although identification of the initial adult cell (duct, acinar, centroacinar) that acquires the mutation and initiates the transformation cascade remains unknown. Recent studies examining pancreatic cancer in mouse models have shown thatKrasoncogene expression in adult acinar cells leads to PDAC that fully mimics the human disease (10,13,15,16). Lineage-tracing ofElastase-CreER; LSL-KrasNone; R26RNonemice confirmed that activation ofKrasNonein adult acinar cells induces acinar-ductal metaplasia (ADM), which can progress to pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) and on to PDAC (Figure 1A). Despite this fundamental process of initiating a transformation pathway, it has been difficult to study the intricacies of ADM - greater than PanIN - greater than PDAC in the intact animal. In an effort to dissect the initialKrasNone-dependent pathwaysin vitro, we asked if ADM could be modeled in tissue culture. Previous studies showed that wildtype acinar cells treated with TGFalpha and maintained in a 3D collagen matrix converted to duct-like cysts that activated EGFR downstream signaling pathways, including Ras (4,19). To determine if constitutive KRAS activity could similarly lead to ductal cyst formation,Mist1None; LSL-KrasNone; R26RNoneorElastase-CreER; LSL-KrasNonemice were treated with corn oil (control) or tamoxifen (TM) to activate acinar-specificKrasNoneexpression. Pancreata were then harvested 7 days post-treatment, digested with collagenase and individual acini clusters placed in a 3D collagen matrix. As expected, control andKrasNone-expressing acinar cells initially retained their normal apical-basal polarity with the rER accumulating at the basal aspect and zymogen granules clustered at the apical pole (Figure 1B). However, by 5 days in 3D culture there was a dramatic difference in cell viability between theKrasNone-expressing and non-expressing cell populations. Control acinar cells rapidly became disorganized and underwent massive cell death. In contrast, a high proportion (~70-90%) ofKrasNone-expressing acinar cells survived and converted to ductal cyst structures that were comprised of a single layer of epithelial cells surrounding an empty luminal space, resembling the metaplastic ADM/PanIN lesions observedin vivo(Figure 1A,B). Interestingly, these metaplastic cysts were virtually identical to structures formed by primary pancreatic duct cells (20). Lineage tracing using theR26RNonereporter allele confirmed that the ductal cysts were derived via transdifferentiation of matureKrasNone-expressing acinar cells (Figure 1B). In agreement with a recent study by Heidet al. (21), ductal cyst conversion was dependent onKrasNoneactivity as the vast majority of control acinar cells (-TM) failed to convert to ductal cysts over the duration of the experiment (Figure 1C). The profound morphological changes in the 3D cultures were reminiscent of thein vivochanges that take place in the whole organ uponKrasNoneactivation. Indeed, a dramatic switch from acinar to ductal gene expression profiles occurred during the 5 day culture period. At day 0, individual acini expressed high levels of amylase, elastase, carboxypeptidase and lipase, with virtually no detectable expression of duct gene products including keratin 19 (K19), cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and carbonic anhydrase II (CAII) (Figure 2;3), confirming the purity of the starting acinar cell preparation. As expected, these cells also expressed high levels of the acinar-specific transcription factorsPtf1aandMist1(Figure 2;3), withMist1being essential to maintaining an adult acinar cell phenotype (22). However, by day 5KrasNone-induced ductal cysts exhibited a dramatic shift in their gene expression profiles that mirrored the expression pattern of PanIN lesions. Ductal cysts and PanINs uniformly silenced acinar genes and activated expression of duct-specific genes, including CFTR, K19, CAII and the duct-restricted transcription factors Sox9 and HNF6 (Figure 2;3;S1;S2). These cells also expressed Nestin (Figure 3;S2), a marker of ductal cells in early PanINs (23). As predicted, PanINs inMist1None; LSL-KrasNonepancreata were highly proliferative and a similar proliferation index was observed with theKrasNone-induced ductal cysts (Figure 2;S3). The parallel between ductal cyst formationin vitroand ADM/PanIN genesisin vivosuggests that the 3D acinar culture faithfully mimics the intracellular pathways that regulate acinar-ductal metaplasia. It is well established thatKrasNoneexpression induces cellular transformation by activating downstream signaling events, including the Raf/MEK/ERK, PI3K/AKT and RalGDS/Ral pathways (Figure 4A). Although these pathways have been the subject of potential therapeutic benefit against pancreatic tumors (24,25), little is known about the role they have in the earliest transformation events of ADM and PanIN formation. In an effort to dissect the importance of the PI3K/AKT and Raf/MEK/ERK pathways prior to tumor formation, we examinedMist1None; LSL-KrasNone(HET/Kras) pancreata 3 months post-TM to ascertain if ADM/PanIN regions exhibited elevated KRAS signaling. Interestingly, despite the fact that greater than =90% of adult acinar cells expressKrasNone, only regions of ADM/PanIN exhibited sufficiently high pAKT and pERK levels that could be detected by immunohistochemistry (Figure 4B). Thus, expression ofKrasNonein acinar cells (for up to 3 months) is not sufficient to uniformly activate the PI3K/AKT and Raf/MEK/ERK arms of the KRAS pathway in all cells. To examine the importance of the pAKT and pERK pathways in converting acinar cells to ADM, we investigated these KRAS downstream pathways in the 3D culture model. As an initial test, we examined the importance of the upstream EGFR pathway with respect toKrasNone-induced ductal cyst formation. As previously reported (4,19,21), wildtype acinar cells placed in 3D culture exhibited only background levels of ductal cysts. However, when cells were provided TGFalpha, rapid ductal cyst formation occurred (Figure 4C). As expected, inhibition of EGFR by the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor PD153035 completely blocked ductal cyst formation of wildtype acinar cells but had no effect on HET/Kras ductal cyst formation, confirming that KRAS functions downstream of EGFR (Figure 4A,C). We next examined the importance of the PI3K/AKT and Raf/MEK/ERK pathways for ductal cyst formation in Het/Kras mice. As predicted, elevated pAKT was observed inKrasNone-isolated acinar cells when compared to control cells isolated from corn oil treated littermates (Figure 4D). Treatment of the cultures with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 led to a ~70% reduction in pAKT levels but had no significant effect on ductal cyst formation in the 3D culture model. Likewise, 90% reduction of pAKT levels by the PI3K inhibitor VIII produced only modest decreases in ADM conversion (Figure S4). Together, these results suggest that the PI3K/AKT pathway is not required for, nor essential to, acinar-ductal metaplasia. A similar analysis was performed on the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. Whereas control cells exhibited low levels of pERK, Het/Kras acinar cells had elevated pERK levels (Figure 4E). Treatment of cells with the MEK inhibitor PD98059 efficiently blocked accumulation of pERK at concentrations as low as 20 muM. Interestingly, inhibition of MEK activity perfectly correlated with decreased ductal cyst formation (Figure 4E). We propose that activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway in a subset ofKrasNone-expressing acinar cells is required to initiate an ADM response in mouse models of PDAC. KrasNone-expressing acinar cells rapidly lose their acinar characteristics as they acquire a duct-like phenotype (13,17). An early event of this switch is silencing theMist1locus, which encodes a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor critical to acinar cell differentiation (4,17). Mist1is highly expressed in pancreatic acinar cells and its expression correlates with cellular differentiation and the establishment of the secretory machinery (22,26). Previous studies have shown that human acinar cells loseMist1expression upon ADM/PanIN formation (4,17), and in mouse models devoid of theMist1gene,KrasNone-expressing acinar cells rapidly undergo ADM and develop extensive PanIN lesions through a pathway that involves elevated pERK activity (4,27). Therefore, we hypothesized that MIST1 promotes acinar cell differentiation and suppresses the oncogenic activity ofKrasby keeping pERK levels low. Given that ADM is dependent on MAPK activity (Figure 4E), we examined if sustainedMist1expression could restrict the conversion ofKrasNone-expressing acinar cells to ductal cysts. To test this concept, a transgenic mouse line (LSL-Mist1None) that produces constitutiveMist1expression upon Cre-mediated recombination was generated (Figure 5A). Transgene expression of myc-taggedMist1was driven by a CMV early enhancer/chicken beta-actin hybrid promoter, whose activity is independent of the differentiation status of cells (28). WhenMist1None; LSL-KrasNone; LSL-Mist1None(KO/Kras/Mist1myc) mice were treated with TM,Mist1Noneexpression was observed in greater than 90% acinar cells with no expression detected in duct cells or in corn oil treated (-TM) control mice (Figure 5B). Next, we examined MAPK activity in pancreata +/-KrasNoneandMist1expression. As shown inFigure 5C, loss ofMist1(KO) led to elevated pERK levels, even in the absence ofKrasNoneexpression. However, sustainedMist1Noneexpression in the KO/Kras/Mist1mycpancreata generated lower pERK levels when compared to KO/Kras littermates (Figure 5C). We then examined how constitutiveMist1Noneexpression influenced ductal cyst conversion in 3D cultures. As expected,Mist1+/-(HET) andMist1-/-(KO) acini generated few ductal cysts when placed in collagen matrix for 5 days (Figure 5D). In contrast, TM-treatedMist1None; LSL-KrasNone(HET/Kras) acini rapidly converted to ductal cysts and the percentage of conversion increased whenMist1None; LSL-KrasNone(KO/Kras) acinar cells were tested (Figure 5D;S5). Importantly, when KO/Kras/Mist1mycacini were examined, ductal cyst formation was reduced to levels approaching those observed inKrasNone-negative (Mist1+/-,Mist1-/-) cells (Figure 5D;S5). Similar results were obtained with the TGFalpha model whereMist1Noneexpression blocked TGFalpha-induced ductal cyst formation ofMist1-/-acinar cells (Figure S6). These results demonstrate that sustainedMist1expression lowers pERK levels and protects acinar cells from TGFalpha- orKrasNone-induced ADM formationin vitro. Finally, to determine if sustainedMist1expression could similarly deter ADM/PanIN developmentin vivo, adult KO/Kras/Mist1mycmice and their littermate controls were treated with TM and pancreata were examined three months post-TM for the presence of ADM and PanIN lesions. HET/Kras mice developed rare focal areas of ADM and PanIN lesions at 3 months and in all cases theMist1locus was transcriptionally silenced in acinar-derived PanINs and in advanced ADM lesions (Figure 6A,B). As expected, KO/Kras pancreata developed organ-wide extensive ADM/PanINs owing to the absence ofMist1prior toKrasNoneactivation (Figure 6A,B). In contrast, sustainedMist1Noneexpression greatly attenuated ADM/PanIN development in the KO/Kras/Mist1mycmice as the majority of the organ consisted of normal appearing acinar tissue with only isolated areas of ADM/PanINs (Figure 6A,B). Indeed, the number of PanINs that developed in KO/Kras/Mist1mycmice and reported inFigure 6Bactually represent an upper limit because not all PanINs (~18%) were MIST1mycpositive, presumably due to selected Cre-mediated recombination of theLSL-KrasNonelocus and not theLSL-Mist1Nonetransgene. Thus, a subset ofKrasNone-expressing acinar cells did not have an opportunity to respond to sustained MIST1 protein. However, despite the clear protective effect ofMist1Noneexpression, MIST1mycproteinper sedid not fully inhibitKrasNone-induced PanINs as MIST1myc+ PanINs were still generated, albeit at a greatly reduced level (Figure 6A,B). The MIST1myc-dependent reduction in ADM/PanIN formation was also reflected in the expression profiles of key acinarvs.ductal genes where MIST1mycsignificantly reduced ductal gene activity while maintaining acinar gene expression to levels approaching, or exceeding, those obtained with HET/Kras mice (Figure 6C). These results are consistent with MIST1 exerting an anti-ADM/PanIN activity in the intact pancreas and support the concept that constitutiveMist1expression mitigates the activity of oncogenicKrasNonein acinar cells, leading to a reduction in ADM/PanIN formation. The role of acinar cells in pancreatic tumorigenesis has long been suspected, but definitive evidence had been lacking until lineage tracing studies established that PanINs and PDAC can arise from adult acinar cells (10,13,16). These studies also implicated the process of acinar-ductal metaplasia as a bridge between normal acinar cells and duct-like PanINs. Consistent with this hypothesis, ADM occurrence precedes PanIN development in PDAC mouse models (17). Despite the central role forKrasNonein inducing ADM,Krasmutations are not a prerequisite. MutantKrasis often detected in ADM and low-grade PanIN lesions in human diseased organs but these mutations are not universally present (2,29), suggesting that additional underlying events can influence ADM formation. Indeed, exposure to EGFR growth factors leads to metaplastic lesionsin vitroandin vivoin the absence of activeKras(30,31). Similarly, EGFR activity is a hallmark ofKras-induced ADM/PanIN lesions (17), implying a central role for this pathway inKras-dependent andKras-independent ADM. ADM is also commonly associated with acute and chronic pancreatitis in both humans and rodents (18,32,33), suggesting that inflammation and/or cell damage can simultaneously generate an ADM response withoutKrasactivity. Although a number of studies have shown that metaplastic cells in pancreatitis settings eventually resume an acinar cell phenotype (33,34), the presence ofKrasmutations efficiently redirects metaplastic cells toward PanIN development (15,35). These results, together with the observation that chronic pancreatitis increases the risk for PDA (36), underscore the relevance of ADM in pancreatic tumorigenesis and the need to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that regulate the fate of metaplastic cells. In this study, we adopted a collagen matrix 3D culture assay to model the conversion of mature acinar cells to ductal metaplastic cells within a compressed timeframe (5 daysvs.months). As expected, expression of theKrasNoneoncogene promoted formation of duct-like cysts, with an efficacy similar to treatment of wildtype acinar cells with exogenous TGFalpha (4,19,21). Further analysis confirmed that the starting cell preparation was highly enriched for amylase-expressing acinar cells, which converted to K19-expressing ductal cells in the presence ofKrasNone. Using inhibitors that specifically blocked individual signaling components, we also demonstrated that Raf/MEK/ERK represent a critical downstream effector pathway through which KRAS operates to induce ADM. Interestingly,BrafNoneandKrasNone, the predominantrafandrasgene mutations, respectively, in pancreatic cancer operate in a mutually exclusive pattern in pancreatic tumors, suggesting that upstream (KrasNone) or downstream (BrafNone) effectors of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway exhibit interchangeable functions in converting acinar cells to ADM lesions (37). Recent lineage-tracing studies of primary human acinar cells also revealed that surviving acinar cells undergo an ADM response that is dependent on MAPK activity (38). Likewise, we have found that TGFalpha-induced ADM is also dependent on the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway (unpublished results), revealing that these downstream effectors represent a common regulator of ADM in mouse and human Kras-dependent and Kras-independent settings. Future studies will test if individual dominant-negative mutants of the MAPK pathway similarly block ADM in models of tumorigenesis and pancreatitis. While these studies were in progress, Heidet al. (21) reported that acinar cells isolated fromPtf1aNone; LSL-KrasNonemice were also capable of producing ductal cysts in 3D culture. Additionally, conditional deletion ofRac1significantly blocked ductal cyst formationin vitroand PanIN developmentin vivo. This was a surprising finding as Rac1 is often thought to be activated by the PI3K pathway which we showed by selective inhibition to be nonessential for ADM formation. However, a number of studies have shown that Rac can also be activated in a PI3K-independent fashion via the Raf-specific guanine exchange factor Tiam1 (39,40). Importantly,Tiam1null mice are resistant to Ras-induced tumor formation (41), confirming the importance of the Tiam1-Rac1 axis for the Ras signaling pathway. Thus, our study and the work by Heidet al. (21) strongly suggest that there are two key pathways (MAPK and Rac1) that are instrumental inKras-induced ADM and that both pathways are essential to converting normal acinar cells into ADM and PanIN lesions. Future PDAC therapeutic strategies that target both pathways are likely to have higher efficacy than approaches targeting only a single effector. Are there other ways to block ADM? We can find some leads in studies of pancreatitis, where most ADM spontaneously heals and re-differentiates in the absence ofKrasNonesignaling. For example, beta-catenin activation following acute pancreatitis is required for acinar cell regeneration, while stabilized beta-catenin protects acinar cells againstKras--induced PanIN formation (16). Similarly,Mist1exhibits a protective role not only inKrasNone-induced ADM but also in ADM associated with acute pancreatitis, whereMist1null pancreata endure more severe damage following caerulein treatment (42). At this time, it is unclear howMist1influences ADM decisions. One possibility is that MIST1 protects acinar cells from metabolic stress associated with pancreatitis orKrasNoneexpression by regulating aspects of the MAPK pathway. Indeed,Mist1is silenced in pancreatitis-associated acinar cells (unpublished results) andMist1Noneacinar cells exhibit increased MEK and ERK phosphorylation (4). Given the central role of the MAPK pathway in ADM and the observation that pancreatitis enhancesKrasNone-induced tumorigenesis (15,35,43), it is likely thatMist1inhibits ADM by maintaining basal levels of these MAPK effectors. SinceMist1is influential in converting embryonic stem cells to an acinar cell fate (44), sustainedMist1expression also likely keeps key acinar characteristics intact inKrasNonecells. Further investigation into the mechanisms of this regulatory network and identification of MIST1 target genes should lead to better therapeutic interventions and improved clinical outcomes for PDAC patients. Mist1CreER/+, LSL-KrasG12D/+, R26RLacZand R26RmTmGreporter mouse lines have been described previously (4,13,45). ElastaseNone-CreERmice were generated according to standard protocols using a previously reported Elastasepr-Mist1MBconstruct where the Mist1MBcoding region was replaced by a CreERT2coding region to drive acinar-specific expression of CreERT2(46). LSL-Mist1Nonetransgenic mice were generated using thepCAG-LoxP-CAT-LoxP-LacZconstruct in which theLacZgene was replaced by a myc-taggedMist1coding sequence (47). Induction of CreERT2activity was accomplished by providing adult mice (6-9 wk) tamoxifen (TM, 4 mg/mouse/day) for 2-3 consecutive days. Genotyping primer sets are listed inSupplemental Table I. All animal studies were conducted in compliance with NIH and the Purdue University IACUC guidelines. Mice were treated with TM 7 days prior to harvesting the pancreas. Immediately after sacrificing, pancreata were rinsed in cold 1X HBSS (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and cut into small pieces with scissors. Primary acini were released by collagenase P (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) digestion (200 mug/ml in 1x HBSS) for 10-20 minutes at 37 degrees C. Isolated acini were washed 3 times in cold 5% FBS, 1x HBSS and then filtered sequentially through 500 mum and 105 mum nylon meshes (Spectrum Laboratories, Rancho Dominguez, CA). Cell suspensions were carefully layered on top of 30% FBS, 1x HBSS and acini were collected by centrifugation (1000 rpm, 2 min at 4 degrees C) and then resuspended in 8 ml of 3D culture base medium (RPMI, 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 mug/ml dexamethasone and antibiotics). 24-well tissue culture plates were coated with a 250 mul/well collagen layer (100 mul 10x RPMI, 900 mul 3mg/ml collagen, neutralized with either 4.2% NaHCO3or 0.34N NaOH) at least one hr prior to acini isolation. The cell suspension was then mixed with collagen 1:1 and plated (0.5 ml per well). The cell-collagen mix was allowed to solidify for 1 hr at 37 degrees C before adding 1 ml 3D culture media. Media was changed on days 1 and 3. On day 5 the percentage of acini that converted to ductal cysts was calculated by counting individual clusters in all wells. Collagen matrix was then digested for 10-15 min at 37 degrees C with 200 mug/ml collagenase P in 1x HBSS to release cells. RNA was prepared using the E.Z.N.A. total RNA kit (Omega Bio-Tek, Norcross, GA). Alternatively, collagen discs were fixed in 4% formaldehyde, embedded in paraffin and 5 mum sections were prepared for standard immunohistochemistry as described below. Mouse pancreata were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, paraffin embedded, sectioned to 5 mum and stained using conventional hematoxylin and eosin. Sections were deparaffinized and retrieved using the 2100-Retriever (PickCell Laboratories, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) and antigen unmasking solution (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Samples were blocked using the MOM blocking reagent (Vector Laboratories) and incubation of primary antibodies was conducted for 1 hr at room temperature or overnight at 4 degrees C. Biotinylated secondary antibodies were applied for 10 min at 25 degrees C. Visualization was accomplished via 3,3'-Diaminobenzidine peroxidase staining or tertiary avidin-conjugated fluorescent antibodies. Primary antibodies and conditions are provided inSupplemental Table II. Twenty mug of whole cell protein extracts were separated on 12% acrylamide gels, transferred to PVDF membranes and incubated with primary antibodies (antibody conditions are provided inSupplemental Table III). Immunoblots were developed using an ECL kit (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). Pancreas RNA or RNA from 3D cultures was isolated using the E.Z.N.A. total RNA kit and reverse transcribed using the iScriptTM cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Equal amounts of cDNA reactions were amplified with FastStart Universal SYBR Green Master (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) using the primer sets listed inSupplemental Table IV. Target sequences were amplified with 95 degrees C/30 sec, 59 degrees C/60 sec, 72 degrees C/30 sec conditions. Fold changes in gene expression between TM-treated and control animals or between day 0 and day 5 3D cultures were calculated using the comparative 2-DeltaDeltaCtmethod. Error bars represent the S.E.M.
