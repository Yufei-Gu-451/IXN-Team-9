Human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) is a sensitive serological marker in monitoring trophoblastic disease activity in gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD;Bagshawe, 1992). Patients diagnosed with low-risk gestational trophoblastic neoplasias (GTN), comprising ?95% of malignant GTD forms (including invasive mole, choriocarcinoma, epitheliod trophoblastic and placental site trophoblastic tumours) have International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) 2000 risk scores ranging from 0 to 6 and are treated using single-agent chemotherapy (Kohorn, 2001;ChalouhiNone, 2009). The 8-day methotrexate (MTX) protocol modified byBagshaweNone, 1989is the most commonly used regimen in Europe (SavageNone, 2008;ChalouhiNone, 2009;KerkmeijerNone, 2009). MTX treatment is continued until either normalisation of serum hCG concentration and further three cycles or resistance to MTX therapy is detected (SecklNone, 2010). In cases of MTX resistance, observed in nearly one-half of low-risk cases (Sita-LumsdenNone, 2012), patients are changed to either actinomycin D (ACT-D) or to a combination of etoposide, MTX, ACT-D, cyclophosphamide and vincristine regimen (EMA-CO) regimens (PowlesNone, 2007;Patel Desai, 2010). Tumour chemoresistance is frequently defined as an increase or stagnation of hCG levels over a 2- to 3-week period, but no consensus guideline has been defined (FoulmannNone, 2006). Ambiguity concerning the definition of MTX resistance based on changing hCG levels increases the likelihood that patients will receive repetitive ineffective cycles of MTX chemotherapy. Several previous studies have attempted to develop new methods to enable earlier identification of patients that will develop MTX resistance (van TrommelNone, 2006;SavageNone, 2008;KerkmeijerNone, 2009;GrowdonNone, 2009a). Among these, a previous study led by the French reference centre for treatment of GTN (Centre de Reference des Maladies Trophoblastiques, Lyon, France), showed that mathematical modelling of individual declining hCG measurements using a population kinetic approach is feasible, and that derived parameters were strong early predictors of MTX resistance (YouNone, 2010). The study concluded that validation of the study's assumptions in independent cohorts of patients was warranted. Charing Cross Hospital's Trophoblastic Disease Unit (London, UK) is a leading centre for treatment of GTN (SecklNone, 2010). The objective of the present study was to validate the predictive value of the hCG kinetic modelling approach with respect to MTX resistance in low-risk GTN, using the Charing Cross Centre's data. HCG measurement and clinical data from patients diagnosed with low-risk GTN and registered between August 1991 and January 2011 were retrieved from the Charing Cross Hospital's database. All patients were treated with the 8-day MTX regimen of 50 mg intramuscular MTX on days 1, 3, 5 and 7, combined with 15 mg oral folinic acid on days 2, 4, 6 and 8, every 2 weeks as first-line treatment for low-risk GTN according to the FIGO 2000 guidelines (BagshaweNone, 1989;Kohorn, 2001). Treatment was continued for three cycles after normalisation of serum hCG concentration ( less than 5 IU l-1). In cases of MTX resistance, defined as three static or three rising hCG measurements, treatment was changed to second-line treatment (SecklNone, 2010). The static versus changing distinction being +/-10% of the preceding serum hCG concentration. Exclusion criteria included: (i) treatment with less than 3 cycles of MTX, (ii) treatment variants from the conventional MTX regimen and (iii) hCG monitoring with less than 3 measurement time points. Total hCG serum concentrations were determined using an in-house competitive radioimmunoassay, which uses a polyclonal rabbit anti-serum. The lower limit of detection is 1.6 IU l-1(calculated as 2 s.d. above the zero standard) and the coefficient of variation (CV) at ?3 IU l-1is estimated at 14% (HarveyNone, 2010). The 800 low-risk GTN patient cohort treated with the 8-day MTX regimen was divided into two: (i) a Model data set composed of 418 patients (195 MTX-resistant and 223 MTX-sensitive patients) and (ii) a Test data set comprising 382 patients (144 MTX-resistant and 238 MTX-sensitive patients;Figure 1). A three-step scheme was used to ascertain the predictive value of population kinetic modelling of hCG data, using the patient cohort's Model and Test data sets (Figure 1) according to the following outline procedure:NoneNoneNoneEstimation of individual kinetic parameters using population kinetic modelling of hCG measurements in Model data set patients. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to assess the predictive values of the modelled kinetic parameters regarding MTX-resistance risk. Challenging the Test data set using the most predictive kinetic parameter identified, using the Model set to estimate the test's performance and assess reproducibility. Comparison of the relative predictive value of the best kinetic predictor identified using the Model data set with that of previously reported predictors of MTX resistance, using ROC curves and multivariate statistics (logistic regression; Cox-model survival test) in a combined data set, called the multivariate analysis data set, comprising model and test patients that had all required data (Figure 1). The population pharmacokinetic model developed by the French national centre in 2010 was used to fit declining hCG measurements from data of patients extracted from the Charing Cross Hospital database (YouNone, 2010). Details of the mono-exponential model have been previously described (YouNone, 2010). The model was further refined and the kinetic parameter 'hCGres', related to residual production at the end of hCG decline, was derived following fitting of declining hCG values using the final model:hCGNone(t)=(hCG0None*e-Ki*t+hCGresNone) (1+E1None)where hCGNone(t) is thejth hCG measurement in patientiat timet; hCGresNoneis the hCG residual production of patienti;E1Nonerepresents the proportional residual variability at thejth measurement of patienti, which is assumed to follow a normal distribution with zero mean andsigma2variance. Ki is the hCG decline rate constant. Parameters K and hCGres were assumed to vary between patients according to a normal log distribution; because of the heterogeneity in baseline hCG levels, a Box-Cox distribution was assumed for hCG0 in the population. Moreover, censored observations of hCG titres below the limit of quantification (i.e., those measurements recorded as less than 2 IU l-1) were handled using the so-called M3 method, which considers the likelihood of observations being below the quantifiable limit (Beal, 2001;AhnNone, 2008;Bergstrand and Karlsson, 2009). The kinetic analysis used hCG measurements taken between the first day of MTX treatment (day 0) and day 50. If the treatment was altered during the first 50 treatments days, further hCG titres were not included in the analysis. The predictive performance of the final model was evaluated by visual predictive check (VPC) method, an approach commonly adopted for internal validation in modelling studies (BrendelNone, 2006;DartoisNone, 2007). The analysis was performed using a non-linear mixed-effects modelling strategy, implemented in NONMEM Version 7 (BealNone, 2009) (full details inAppendix online). Continuous ROC curve analyses were used to assess the predictive values of modelled K and hCGres in the Model data set. Among them, the hCGres kinetic parameter, which offered the highest discriminative value, based on the highest value of ROC area under the curve (AUC) was selected for further analyses. The optimal hCGres cut-off value for discriminating resistantvssensitive patients was determined by the intersection of minimal overlap of the true-positive and true-negative populations for the Model data set, that is, where sensitivity (Se)+specificity (Sp) was maximised. The final model and optimal cut-off value derived using the Model data set was applied, to independently estimate individual values of hCGres in the Test data set patients. As previously, declining hCG values observed during the first 50 MTX treatment days were fitted using the Maximum A posteriori algorithm in NONMEMTM software. The theoretical MTX resistance risk of the Test data set patients was defined in every subject based on the Model set's defined cut-off value. The accuracy of prediction was then assessed using discontinuous ROC curve analysis. Other previously reported predictive factors for chemoresistance considered in the comparative analysis were: WHO-FIGO score (classified between 0 and 6); choriocarcinoma (yesvsno;YouNone, 2010); hCG level measured 1 week after treatment start, categorised according toGrowdonNone(2009b)cut-offvalue greater than 2000 IU l-1(Growdanet al, 2009b) or hCG level in the seventh week, categorised according to different thresholds, ?520.24vs greater than 520.24 IU l-1(van TrommelNone, 2006); ?500vs greater than 500 IU l-1(SavageNone, 2008); and ?737vs greater than 737 IU l-1(KerkmeijerNone, 2009). Using the multivariate analysis data set, the relative predictive performance of modelled hCGres was compared against the previously reported predictors using ROC curve analysis. Moreover, the independence of the predictive value of hCGres for MTX resistance was compared against these predictors, considered as continuous or categorised covariates, using multivariate logistic regression. A backward elimination procedure was used to select the independent predictive factors. The data set was also used to assess hCGres-predictive ability regarding MTX treatment failure. MTX failure was defined as MTX resistance or relapse of disease. Relapse was defined as recurrent disease requiring further chemotherapy marked by elevated hCG detected following previously successful chemotherapy (where hCG had been normalised for ?6 weeks). The predictive value of hCGres was assessed using univariate (log-rank test) and multivariate (Cox model) survival tests. A backward elimination procedure was used to select the independent predictive factors. All tests were performed with S-Plus (TIBCO Software Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA) or SPSS (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) using a two-sided 0.05alpha-risk. Landmark time point analyses with time threshold set at 50 days were performed to ensure the validity of results and lack of bias. As a result, ROC curve analyses and survival tests were performed with specific data sets, excluding patients treated with a second-line treatment before day 50. Results are shown inAppendix, (online only) because results were consistent with those obtained with all data sets. Patient characteristics in model and test data sets are presented inTable 1. Parameter estimates and their respective s.e. are reported inTable 2. Typical values and CV between patients of hCG0, K and hCGres were 14 400 IU l-1(CV: 152%), 0.169 per day (CV: 306%) and 24.7 IU l-1(CV: 35%), respectively. The goodness-of-fit plots show that individual hCG profiles were well fitted during the first 50 treatment days by the model (Figures 2Aand3). The VPC method showed that the median, 5% and 95% of the observed hCG values over time were included within 95% confidence interval boundaries of the simulated median, 5% and 95% of hCG, in keeping with the good data fitting by the model (Figure 2B). The abilities of hCGres and K for predicting MTX resistance were compared using ROC curves. On the basis of the AUC values, hCGres was a better predictor of MTX resistance than K (AUC for continuous ROC=0.94, 95% CI=0.91-0.96vsAUC=0.69, 95% CI=0.64-0.74;Figure 4A) and was, therefore, selected for further analyses. The optimal cut-off value for hCGres for discriminating resistantvssensitive predictor was found to be 20.44 IU l-1. When the model data set patients were reassessed by discontinuous ROC analysis after classifying them into two predictive groups, as either high MTX-resistant risk ( greater than 20.44 IU l-1) or low risk (?20.44 IU l-1) to ascertain hCGres's predictive diagnostic performance at the optimal cut-off value, the AUC was 0.87 (95% CI=0.65-1) with 91% sensitivity (95% CI=0.86-0.94), 83% specificity (95% CI=0.78-0.88), 83% positive predictive value (PPV) and 91% negative predictive value (NPV). Individual values of hCGres were estimated in Test data set patients using the same model as defined above. Patient risk of resistance was predicted based on the greater than 20.44 IU l-1hCGres threshold. The outcome regarding the predictive value of modelled hCGres in the Test patient data set was almost identical to that observed with the Model set patients: AUC=0.87, (95%=0.65-1) with 88% sensitivity (95% CI=0.82-0.93), 86% specificity, (95% CI=0.81-0.90), PPV=79% and NPV=92%, confirming the high reproducibility of the methodological approach. Using a binomial logistic regression model, including the WHO-FIGO score (HR=1.17, 95% CI=0.99-1.38), choriocarcinoma (yesvs.no, HR=1.02, 95% CI=0.36-2.87), high hCG titre at week 1 categorised by greater than 2000 IU l-1cut-off value defined byGrowdonNone(2009a; HR=1, 95% CI=1-1), high hCG at week 7 categorised by greater than 737 IU l-1threshold defined byKerkmeijerNone(2009; HR=1, 95% CI=1-1.01) and hCGres, the only significant independent predictive factor of MTX resistance was hCGres (HR=1.009, 95% CI=1.007-1.011,P less than 0.0001). The AUCs of the discrete ROC curves for other previously reported predictors of the MTX resistance in multivariate analysis data set were also assessed (Figure 4B). The highest AUC was with hCGres ( greater than 20.44 IU l-1: AUC=0.86, 95% CI=0.83-0.89) compared with hCG value on week 1 ( greater than 2000 IU l-1: AUC=0.64, 95% CI=0.60-0.69), hCG values on week 7 ( greater than 500 IU l-1: AUC=0.70, 95% CI=0.65-0.74; greater than 520.24 IU l-1: AUC=0.69, 95% CI=0.65-0.74; greater than 737 IU l-1: AUC=0.66, 95% CI=0.62-0.70) and the WHO-FIGO score (AUC=0.66, 95% CI=0.62-0.70). After a median follow-up period of 4.89 years, 358 patients out of 800 patients (44.7%) experienced resistance and/or a relapse (i.e., MTX treatment failure). Relapses were observed in 19 out of 461patients considered sensitive to MTX (4.1%) after a median of 277 days (IQR: 187-462). All patients with MTX resistance or relapse were treated with second-line treatment (Table 3). Three-year MTX failure-free survival was significantly higher in patients with hCGres values ?20.44, (88.4%vs17%,P less than 0.0001;Figure 4C). Data from 669 patients in the multivariate analysis data set was also analysed in a multivariate Cox model. The only significant independent predictors of MTX failure-free survival were as follows: high-modelled individual hCGres categorised by greater than 20.44 threshold (HR=14.51, 95% CI=9.78-21.09); high hCG titre at week 1 categorised by greater than 2000 IU l-1cut-off value defined byGrowdonNone(2009a; HR=0.62, 95% CI=0.45-0.83) and high hCG at week 7 categorised by greater than 737 IU l-1threshold defined byKerkmeijerNone(2009; HR=2.19, 95% CI=1.65-2.90). Current trophoblastic disease management is heavily reliant on serum hCG monitoring (SecklNone, 2010). As such, hCG and low-risk GTN provides an excellent disease model to demonstrate the potential utility of population kinetic modelling of disease-specific biomarkers for rationalisation of treatment decisions. Using the largest cohort of low-risk GTN patients reported in the literature to date, we have demonstrated that population kinetic modelling of patients' hCG measurements during the first 50 days of MTX treatment provides a parameter, hCGres, which is a strong, independent and reproducible predictor for MTX resistance. The continuous ROC AUC for discriminating subsequent MTX resistance in the Model data set was 0.94, which, according toSwets' (1988)criteria, describes an 'excellent' test. These findings are consistent with those of the first French study, and those of a recent retrospective analysis of American GOG-174 phase III trial data (YouNone, 2010;YouNone, 2012). Moreover, the risk of MTX resistance could be predicted with better accuracy than using other previously reported predictors, including absolute hCG concentration thresholds. The kinetic approach was expected to have greater predictive power and show better reproducibility than using single hCG concentration thresholds as the effects of measurement intra- or interindividual inaccuracies (e.g., related to the use of different immunoassays) are reduced during fitting by the least squares method across multiple measurements (YouNone, 2010;BidartNone, 1999). However, the application and comparability of the cut-off values derived by the other studies is limited due to differences in (i) study design and categorisation of patients (KerkmeijerNone(2009)study's derived cut-off value was for discrimination of 'monotherapy resistance' rather than just MTX resistance alone), (ii) prevalence of the test positive condition and (iii) the use of different assays (van TrommelNone, 2006;SavageNone, 2008). The proportion of MTX-resistant patients in our low-risk GTN cohort (42%) was higher than the varying proportions reported in earlier clinical studies (ranging 18 to 40%PowlesNone, 2007;Patel and Desai, 2010), but is in agreement with the largest studies which found 39-43% (KerkmeijerNone, 2009;Sita-LumsdenNone, 2012). Most strikingly, when the same cut-off value derived for hCGres in the present study was applied to the original French study's data set of 154 patients, where serum hCG was measured weekly using various assays at different centres, an equivalent ROC assessment for MTX resistance was found with AUC=0.85 (95% CI=0.78-0.92), further confirming the high reproducibility of the methodological approach. The hCGres parameter also appeared to be a strong independent predictor of MTX failure, defined as MTX resistance or relapse, sometimes occurring several months after hCG normalisation. Prediction of MTX failure could have greater clinical relevance than MTX resistance alone, as it may be argued that the better measure of a specific treatment's success is lifelong cure from the disease (PowlesNone, 2007). Patients with an hCGres greater than 20.44 IU l-1after three fully dosed treatment cycles of MTX had a more than 80% chance of MTX-resistant disease and a 92% 3-year MTX treatment failure risk. Our findings suggest a possible rationale to consider changing to second-line treatment immediately following prediction of MTX resistance using the kinetic method. In the present data set, if patients with hCGres values greater than 20.44 IU l-1were changed to second-line treatment after only three fully dosed cycles of MTX treatment, a total of 478 MTX cycles administered to 226 patients, who were later determined to be MTX resistant and treated with ACT-D (n=109) or EMA-CO (n=117) regimens, would have been saved (83% true-positive rate). Such a strategy would reduce the duration of MTX therapy by 2 weeks in 50% patients (and by 4 weeks in 25% patients) and limit unnecessary use of MTX. However, this approach would also have led to unnecessary treatment change in 66 patients who, despite their high-modelled hCGres values, were cured with MTX therapy (17% false-positive rate). The strategy appears a fair one as only 9 out of 66 (14%, or 1%, of the entire cohort) of these patients, whose hCG levels where ?300 IU l-1after three courses of MTX, would, according to current clinical practice, have been switched to the higher toxicity EMA-CO regimen (SecklNone, 2010), with minimal probability of mortality as recently shown (AlifrangisNone, 2013). The remaining 57 patients would have been changed to the lower toxicity ACT-D regimen, expected to be highly curative in such patients, as shown by the GOG-174 trial outcomes (OsborneNone, 2011). Although unnecessary treatment with EMA-CO represents a greater clinical risk than prolonged ineffective treatment with MTX, where the agreeable balance between them exists is a matter for further research. The authors acknowledge that implementation of a strategy requiring weekly measurements of serum hCG titres may not be possible in all parts of the world. In summary, we have shown that of the previously reported efforts to utilise weekly hCG measurements to predict MTX resistance in low-risk GTN, the population kinetic modelling approach had the highest predictive power and was the most reproducible. We have shown that by using individual calculated hCGres values, it was possible to accurately identify after only three fully dosed MTX cycles, ?80% of patients who will develop MTX resistance. Although model building is a complex process, our results may have practical clinical application. An online programme integrating the model could easily calculate individual modelled kinetic parameters, such as hCGres, from a patient's hCG results. We are currently designing a prospective multicentre European clinical trial with the European Organization for Treatment of Trophoblastic Disease, which would employ such a programme to further validate the clinical utility of hCGres for predicting MTX resistance, particularly with regard to reproducibility of predictive performance, inter-assay hCG cut-off values and the minimum interval requirement for testing.
