Approximately 140?000 people are diagnosed annually with colorectal cancer, and among them 50?000 patients have died of this malignant disease in the U.S. alone during the past decade. NoneMolecular lesions in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene, the largest structural core protein of the beta-catenin destruction complex, are observed frequently in colorectal cancer. None,NoneThis alteration results in stabilization of cytosolic beta-catenin, a multifunctional protein capable of binding to the T-cell factor/lymphocyte enhancer factor (Tcf/LEF) family of transcription factors to induce gene expression. NoneThe gene targets of this expression, activated by beta-catenin response regulated transcription (CRT), includec-Mycandcyclin D1, which play pivotal roles in colorectal tumorigenesis and malignancy. NoneSince APC is a negative regulator directly upstream of beta-catenin,Noneonly a few signaling components of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway can be targeted for development of clinical intervention for such oncogenicity. Among these candidates, an accelerated turnover of beta-catenin has been recognized as a pertinent protocol for cytotoxic agent development. Diverse pharmacophores have been derived from natural products, providing evidence for structural prerequisites for the disruption of the oncogenic beta-catenin function. For instance, we demonstrated that galangin, a flavanone abundantly present in propolis, suppresses CRT via expediting degradation of cytosolic beta-catenin, verifying the disruptive action on Tcf/beta-catenin complexes as at least one of its cytotoxic mechanisms on certain human carcinomas. NoneMoreover, ellagitannins (ETs) were shown to retard Tcf/LEF-dependent transcription activated by a mutant beta-catenin construction, corroborating that the consumption of an ET-enriched diet results in a decline of colon cancer. NoneUnlike terrestrial organisms,None,Nonemarine organisms producing effective cytotoxic secondary metabolitesNonehave been underutilized for exploration of potential modulators of the oncogenic Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. For instance, sponge-derived 4,9-friedodrimane sesquiterpenoids exhibited potent antiproliferative activities via activation of DNA damage-inducible gene 153 and hypoxia-inducible factor-1. None,NoneYet, the inhibitory potential on beta-catenin-associated cellular pathways as the underlying cytotoxic mechanisms of the meroterpenoids has rarely been investigated. NoneBiotransformation is a rational approach to provide a diverse and new series of derivatives that could be employed for the generation of chemical libraries to implement preliminary lead optimization and SAR studies. NoneParticularly, sponges in the order Verongida, featuring unusual biochemical profiles exemplified by the absence of terpenoids and the production of sterols and brominated compounds, exhibited strong oxidative potential. Such characteristics render those sponges as optimal sources to derivatize bioactive molecules for drug screening. In ongoing efforts targeting the search for sponge-derived potent anticancer prototypes,None,Nonethe isolation and structural characterization of eight 4,9-friedodrimane-type sesquiterpenoids generated by biotransformation utilizing the oxidative potential of a Verongida sponge (Verongula rigida) on 4,9-friedodrimanes, typically isolated fromSmenospongiasponges, are discussed herein. The potential of those meroterpenoids to be developed into colon cancer inhibitory agents capable of suppressing CRT via promoting the degradation of beta-catenin is also addressed. It was reported recently that ilimaquinone, a 4,9-friedodrimane-type sesquiterpenoid, and its analogues exhibited antiproliferative activity via suppressing beta-catenin expression. NoneThese results initiated an exploration of new 4,9-friedodrimane derivatives capable of down-regulating expression of the oncogenic protein from marine resources. In an effort to generate new 4,9-friedodrimanes, the aggressive oxidative properties of a Verongida sponge, which are well established to undergo rapid oxidation and rearrangements when exposed to the atmosphere, were employed. NoneSmenospongiasponges producing 4,9-friedodrimanes (Smenospongia aureaandS. cerebriformis) andV. rigidawere homogenized and incubated together at room temperature to facilitate the formation of new analogues from this series. NoneThis approach was successful in generating a number of new 4,9-friedodrimane derivatives for bioassay. The LC-MS analysis of the incubated mixtures of these three sponges exhibited unreported quasimolecular ions (m/z384.2 and 398.2; Figure S1,Supporting Information) from identified friedodrimanes, which prompted further purification of the extract for identification of possible new inhibitors of beta-catenin expression. Fractionation and purification of the extract afforded eight new 4,9-friedodrimane-type sesquiterpenoids (1-8) (Figure1). This report reveals the unique utility that the Verongida sponges may have on metabolism, lead optimization, and SAR studies. Structures of compounds1-8. The ethoxy groups in5-8could be derived from ethanol used for extraction. The HRFABMS of compound1, which exhibited a quasimolecular ion atm/z384.2540 (calcd [M + H]+,m/z384.2539), and its13C NMR data led to its molecular formula being established as C24H33NO3. The1H and13C NMR data (Table1) exhibited resonances for a pentasubstituted aromatic moiety (dH6.98; dC98.8, 109.2, 132.3, 143.7, 144.6, 146.6, 162.0), an exomethylene (dH4.36, 4.32; dC102.7, 160.5), a methoxy (dH3.90; dC56.6), and four methyl groups (dH0.91, 1.04, 1.04, 2.54; dC14.6, 18.5, 17.7, 20.7). Inspection of the 2D NMR spectra indicated the presence of a 4,9-friedodrim-4(11)-ene-type sesquiterpenoid frameworkNoneand a benzoxazole residue. The heterocyclic residue was identical to that of 5-epi-nakijinol C, a recently isolated sesquiterpenoid from the Indonesian spongeDactylospongia metachromia,Nonebased on the deshielded13C NMR chemical shift values of C-20 (dC132.3), C-21 (dC146.6), and C-22 (dC162.0) and the HMBC correlation from H3-23 (dH2.54) to C-22 (dC162.0). NoneHMBC correlations between H2-15 (dH2.80, 2.89) and C-16, C-17, and C-21 (dC109.2, 143.7, 146.6) indicated that the benzoxazole moiety is connected to C-15. The relative configuration of the core framework was established on the basis of analysis of the NOESY spectrum. Key NOESY correlations were detected from H-1ax(dH1.51) to H3-12 (dH1.04) and H3-14 (dH0.91), from H-2ax(dH1.22) to H-10 (dH0.92), and from H3-12 (dH1.04) and H3-13 (dH1.04) to H3-14 (dH0.91), demonstrating that compound1is related structurally to thetrans-4,9-friedodrimanes (Figure2). NoneThis NOESY-based configurational analysis was corroborated by the shielded13C NMR chemical shift value of C-12 (dC20.7), in view of previous studies verifying that13C NMR chemical shift values of C-12 intrans-decalins are more shielded than those incis-decalins (? ca. 10 ppm). None-NoneThe absolute configuration of1was deduced from the consistent absolute configuration oftrans-4,9-friedodrimane meroterpenoids obtained from natural sources and confirmed based on the similar specific rotation value of1with those of reported meroterpenoids (Figure3). NoneThe trivial name (-)-nakijinol E was assigned to1. NOESY analysis to establishtrans- andcis-4,9-friedodrim-4(11)-ene moieties found in this study. Minimization was implemented at the MMFF level employing MacroModel (Schrodinger LLC), and yellow dotted lines indicate NOE correlations. Establishment of absolute configuration of optically pure compounds in this study (i.e., compounds1, 2, 5, and8). Thetrans-friedodrimanes (-)-nakijinol E (1) and (-)-dactylospongenone E (5) displayed negative specific rotations in accord with those of (-)-ilimaquinoneNone,Noneand (-)-dactylospongenone A. NoneInversion of the C-5 absolute configuration with formation of thecis-friedodrimane core structure led to a significant conformational change that is exemplified by a consistent change in the sign of the optical rotation. Thus, the specific rotations of (+)-5-epi-nakijinol E (2) and (+)-5-epi-ethylsmenoquinone (8) are consistent with those of the analogous (+)-5-epi-ilimaquinone. None,NonePartially overlapped.Diastereotopic protons may be interchangeable. The molecular formula of compound2was established as C24H33NO3based on13C NMR and HRFABMS data (obsd [M + H]+,m/z384.2542; calcd [M + H]+,m/z384.2539), implying that compound2is an isomer of1. The 1D NMR spectra were similar to those of1except for the more deshielded C-12 resonance (dC33.2) compared to1(dC20.7). Such deshielding of the methyl carbon in 4,9-friedodrim-4(11)-ene sesquiterpenoids is indicative of inversion of configuration of the C-5 stereogenic center, validating that compound2is the C-5 epimer of1. Key NOESY correlations were detected from H3-14 (dH0.95) to H-2ax(dH1.82) and H3-13 (dH1.01), from H-7ax(dH1.50) to H-11b(dH4.66), and from H3-12 (dH0.98) to H-10 (dH1.40), confirming the presence of acis-4,9-friedodrimane architecture in2(Figure2). NoneThe absolute configuration of compound2was established as for1(Figure3), and the trivial name (+)-5-epi-nakijinol E was assigned to2. Compounds3and4were obtained as a 1:2 mixture, with the ratio being established via the integration of corresponding1H NMR resonances for each compound. The HRFABMS data of this mixture displayed a quasimolecular ion atm/z398.2696, which, in conjunction with the13C NMR data, led to assignment of their same molecular formula as C25H35NO3(calcd [M + H]+,m/z398.2695). The1H and13C NMR data of compounds3and4exhibited several common features to those of1and2aside from the presence of a resonance for an additional methyl group (dH1.58, 1.61; dC25.8, 25.9) in3and4. This suggested that compounds3and4possess 4,9-friedodrim-4(11)-ene scaffolds with different C-15 substituents. The HMBC correlations from H2-15 to C-16, C-17, and C-21 and from H3-23 and H3-24 to C-22 (Figure4) revealed that the C-23 methyl groups of the benzoxazole moieties in1and2are replaced withgem-dimethyl moieties in3and4. The13C NMR chemical shift values of C-12 were observed as dC20.7 and 33.3, establishingtrans-andcis-junctions of the decalin rings in3and4, respectively. This was validated by the NOESY analysis shown in Figure2. When considered in conjunction with the consistent biosynthetic pathways toward the 4,9-friedodrim-4(11)-ene-type meroterpenoids derived from natural sources,Nonethe absolute configurations of compounds3and4are presumably identical to those of thetrans- andcis-4,9-friedodrim-4(11)-enes, respectively. Thus, these substances, based on 4,9-friedodrimanes with a 2,2-dimethylbenzo[d]oxazol-6(2H)-one moiety, possess unique scaffolds, and the trivial names nakijinone A and 5-epi-nakijinone A were assigned to compounds3and4, respectively. Selected HMBC correlations for3and4. The HRFABMS data of compound5displayed an [M + H]+ion atm/z405.2638 (calcd [M + H]+,m/z405.2641), which, in conjunction with the13C NMR data, led to assignment of the molecular formula, C24H36O5. The 1D NMR data were similar to those of compounds1-4, substantiating the presence of a 4,9-friedodrimane framework. The substituted moieties in5showed close similarities with the cyclopentenone moieties in dactylospongenones,None,Nonesimilar merosesquiterpenoids from the Palau and Fijian spongesDactylospongiaspp., based on the observed resonances for an isolated olefinic methine group (dH5.92, dC121.9), keto and ester carbonyl groups (dC198.5, 174.4), a methoxy group (dH3.72, dC57.4), and an oxygenated tertiary carbon (dC80.6). Compound5exhibited resonances corresponding to an ethoxy group (dH1.21, 4.15, 4.26; dC14.3, 63.4) instead of the methoxy groups in dactylospongenones, implying that the substituted heterocyclic moiety in5carries an ethyl ester group. This was verified by HMBC correlations from H2-22 (dH4.15, 4.26) to C-21 (dC174.4) and C-23 (dC14.3) and from H-18 (dH5.92) and H-16 (dH2.61) to C-21 (dC174.4). The HMBC and COSY spectra indicated that the planar structure of5is identical with those of dactylospongenones A-D,None,Noneexcept for the ethyl ester moiety. The shielded C-12 resonances (dC20.6) indicated that the new meroterpenoid has atrans-decalin moiety, and this was corroborated further by the NOESY correlations shown in Figure2. The similar specific rotation and NMR data of5to those of dactylospongenone A (Figure3), except for resonances derived from the ethoxy moiety, imply that5is the ethyl ester equivalent of the methyl ester, dactylospongenone A. Thus, compound5was assigned the trivial name (-)-dactylospongenone E.Compounds6and7were obtained as a 2:3 mixture based on the integration of associated1H NMR resonances for each compound. The HRFABMS data exhibited a single quasimolecular ion atm/z405.2637 (calcd [M + H]+,m/z405.2641). In conjunction with the13C NMR data, this indicated that these components are isomers with a C25H36O5molecular formula. The 1D NMR spectra showed close similarities with those of5except for the deshielded13C NMR chemical shift values of the C-12 resonances in compounds6and7(dC33.0, 33.2), indicating that they are structurally based oncis-friedodrim-4(11)-ene with C-15 cyclopentenone moieties. None,NoneThe stereochemical assignment of the C-15 cyclopentenone moieties was attempted by utilizing gauge-invariant atomic orbital (GIAO) NMR chemical shift calculations coupled with advanced statistics CP3 and DP4 analyses,None,Nonegiven characteristically variable chemical shift values of diastereomers associated with a cyclopentenone moiety. Prior to application of the computational approach, the method was verified for the investigation of stereochemical details of avarane-type sesquiterpenoids. Each pair of epimers addressed in this study (i.e.,1vs2, 3vs4) was used for the validation process employing GIAO NMR chemical shift calculations coupled with CP3. Major conformers were generated by conformational searches using Macromodel (Schrodinger LLC) and subjected to GIAO shielding constant calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level employing the Gaussian 09 package (Gaussian Inc.) (computational details and Table S1,Supporting Information). These calculated chemical shift values were Boltzmann-averaged according to their relative MMFF94 potential energy, and the averaged values were provided for the calculation of CP3 analysis (computational details, Tables S1-S3,Supporting Information). CP3 supported the NMR-based assignment made for each pair of epimers with 100% probability (Figures S2 and S3,Supporting Information), validating that the application of such advanced statistics is a relevant tool in establishing stereochemical details of sesquiterpenoids addressed in this study. With the in silico method corroborated, the fourcis-4,9-friedodrimane-based diastereomers associated with the C-15 cyclopentenone moieties of6and7(I: 16R, 17S;II: 16S, 17R;III: 16R, 17R;IV: 16S, 17S, Figure5) were considered and subjected to chemical shift calculation coupled with DP4 analysis because experimental data were available for only two diastereomers. DP4 application with calculated chemical shift values of diastereomersI-IV(Table S4,Supporting Information) supported the structural equivalence of diastereomerIwith7with 100% probability (Figure S4,Supporting Information), and the consecutive application with the remaining candidates (II-IV) suggested with 100% certainty (Figure S6,Supporting Information) that the absolute configuration of6was identical to diastereomerII. These new merosesquiterpenoids were assigned the trivial names 5-epi-dactylospongenones E (6) and F (7). Plausible diastereomers of fourcis-4,9-friedodrimane-based diastereomers associated with the C-15 cyclopentenone moieties of6and7. The molecular formula of compound8was deduced as C23H32O4based on13C NMR data and HRFABMS analysis (obsd [M + H]+,m/z373.2381; calcd [M + H]+,m/z373.2379). The NMR data displayed the presence of a 5a-methyl-4,9-friedodrimane moiety (dC33.4) carrying a C-15 dioxygenated-1,4-benzoquinone moiety (dH5.82; dC102.4, 117.7, 153.3, 161.2, 182.3, 182.7) and, hence, showing structural resemblance with 5-epi-ilimaquinone. NoneThe NMR data of these two compounds differ in resonances of an ethoxy group (dH1.49, 4.04; dC14.0, 66.1) in8instead of a methoxy moiety in 5-epi-ilimaquinone. This suggests that compound8is an ethyl ether homologue of 5-epi-ilimaquinone, which is confirmed by the HMBC correlations from H2-22 (dH4.04) to C-20 (dC161.2). The specific rotation of compound8is similar to that of 5-epi-ilimaquinone. This permitted the definition of an absolute configuration identical to that of 5-epi-ilimaquinone (Figure3). The trivial name (+)-5-epi-20-O-ethylsmenoquinone was assigned to8. Over the past two decades, many natural products with hydroquinone/benzoquinone-type moieties appended to a sesquiterpene or diterpene skeleton have been reported from marine sponges. NoneThe isolation of 4,9-friedodrimane-type sesquiterpenoids5, and6and7indicate that a competitive intramolecular Michael addition might be associated in the formation of these secondary metabolites. As illustrated in Figure6, the intramolecular addition of enolateBonto the C-20 carbonyl would result in the generation of5and7or6, depending onre-orsi-face addition (path A in Figure6). Alternatively, the addition of the enolate onto the C-21 carbonyl group and tautomerization followed by transetherification would lead to the formation of8(path B in Figure6). In addition to these oxidative metabolites, natural products such as nakijiquinones, smenospongine, and smenospongidine, featuring hydroquinones attached to a sesquiterpene or diterpene scaffold, are also known to be generated from marine organisms. NoneIn this regard, reductive amination ofDfollowed by Schiff's base formation with acetone or acetaldehyde and consecutive isomerization would generateFandG, respectively. Finally, the oxidation of these two intermediates would lead to the more stable benzoxazole moieties in1-4, which might be facilitated by the oxidative properties ofV. rigidautilized in the current biotransformation study. Plausible biosynthetic pathways involved in the generation of1-8. Aberrant activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway accompanied by accumulation of intracellular beta-catenin and subsequent activation of CRT is important in the development and progression of colorectal cancer. None-NoneOwing to limited amounts of isolated compounds, only compounds2,3,4, and8were evaluated for their potential to serve as prototypes of new anticolorectal cancer agents capable of tuning the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. To evaluate their inhibitory activities on the target pathway, HEK293-firefly luciferase (FL) reporter cells stably transfected were constructed with TOPflash, a synthetic beta-catenin/Tcf-dependent FL reporter, and human Frizzled-1 (hFz-1) expression plasmids. NoneIncubation of HEK293-FL reporter cells with different concentrations of compounds2and8and the mixture of3and4decreased the CRT levels that had been activated upon Wnt3a-conditioned medium (Wnt3a-CM) treatment (Figure7A). (A) HEK293-FL reporter cells were incubated with the active molecules in the presence of Wnt3a-CM for 15 h, and luciferase activity was determined. (B) Cytosolic proteins were prepared from HEK293-FL reporter cells treated with the vehicle or the active meroterpenoids in the presence of Wnt3a-CM for 15 h and subjected to Western blotting. (C) Two CRT-positive colon cancer cell lines were incubated with different concentrations of the active meroterpenoids, and cell viability was determined by Cell-Titer-Glo assay. *p less than 0.05 and **p less than 0.01, compared with the vehicle control group. Based on previous studies corroborating that CRT is predominantly dependent on expression levels of intracellular beta-catenin,NoneWestern blot analysis with anti-beta-catenin antibody in HEK293 reporter cells treated with the active compounds2,3,4, and8was conducted to examine whether these secondary metabolites can reduce intracellular beta-catenin levels. Consistent with previous results,Nonebeta-catenin expression was increased upon treatment with Wnt3a-CM (Figure7B). Incubation of HEK293 cells with those active molecules mitigated up-regulated cytosolic beta-catenin expression (Figure7B). Interestingly, the inhibitory potency of the compounds on beta-catenin expression was in accord with their suppressing effects on Wnt3a-CM-activated CRT, suggesting that the active compounds may inhibit the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway via promoting cytosolic beta-catenin degradation. The specific reduction of beta-catenin has been shown to suppress the proliferation of CRT-positive colon cancer cells. NoneTo validate if the active sesquiterpenoids retard proliferation of colon cancer cells via the observed inhibition on the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, two CRT-positive colon cancer cell lines, SW480 and HCT116, were treated with various concentrations of the compounds. Compound2and the mixture of compounds3and4started to exert antiproliferative activity at concentrations more than 20 uM, while compound8began to inhibit tumor growth at 0.75 and 1.5 uM against SW480 (IC50= 3.24 uM) and HCT116 cells (IC50= 2.95 uM), respectively (Figure7C), demonstrating that8displayed more potent cytotoxic activity on the CRP-positive cancer cells than the other compounds. It is thus plausible that the underlying mechanism of the antineoplastic properties of the tested meroterpenoids is closely involved in their mitigating activities on the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway considering that the observed cytotoxic potency on the colon cancer cells is consistent with their down-regulating potential against beta-catenin expression elevated by Wnt3a-CM. In conclusion, marine invertebrates could be a promising resource in providing drug frameworks modulating the oncogenic Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, which may warrant further exploration of such marine organisms for the discovery of colon cancer inhibitory leads. The current study demonstrates the potential of chemical oxidation of the cell contents of a Verongida sponge to expand the diversity of 4,9-friedodrimane metabolites capable of suppressing the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. Such an approach may also be applicable in similar studies with other marine organisms. The current findings show that the 4,9-friedodrimane chemotype could serve as a drug template capable of exerting antineoplastic properties via inhibition of beta-catenin expression. Further structural refinements in selective anticancer drug design can build on this study, presumably in conjunction with insights acquired from well-characterized biochemical mechanisms of colorectal tumorigenesis. Optical rotations were measured on a JASCO DIP-1000 automatic digital polarimeter (Tokyo, Japan). UV-vis spectra were measured on an Agilent 1100 series diode array and multiple-wavelength detectors. The NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian 600 MHz (VNS 600) spectrometer equipped with a 5 mm direct detection pulsed field gradient probe. All NMR experiments were conducted at 294 K using CDCl3as a solvent and referenced by residual solvent signals for CHCl3(dH= 7.24, dC= 77.16). HRFABMS data were obtained from the Korea Basic Science Institute (Daegu) on a JEOL JMS 700 high-resolution mass spectrometer, and LC-MS profiling was performed utilizing an Agilent 1100 HPLC system with a Phenomenex Luna 5 um C18column (4.6 * 250 mm) eluted with an MeOH-H2O gradient solvent system and a Bruker Daltonics microTOF mass spectrometer. Vacuum-liquid chromatography (VLC) was performed on Merck silica gel (70-230 mesh). Medium-pressure liquid chromatography (MPLC) was carried out using a Biotage Isolera equipped with a reversed-phase C18SNAP cartridge KP-C18-HS (120 g, Biotage, Charlotte, NC, USA). High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was implemented on a Gilson system using Luna C18(250 * 21.20 mm, 10 um), Luna C18(250 * 4.60 mm, 5 um), YMC C18(250 * 4.60 mm, 5 um), and Mightysil C18columns (150 * 4.60 mm, 5 um). Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was executed on glass plates precoated with silica gel F254 (20 * 20 cm, 200 um, 60 A, Merck). Smenospongia aurea(08FL-20-B),Smenospongia cerebriformis(08FL-20), andVerongula rigida(08FL-20-A) were collected from Key Largo, FL, in October 2008. The sponges were collected from a shallow coral reef habitat between 3 and 24 m depthNoneand identified by Dr. Michelle Kelly (National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research, Auckland, New Zealand). Voucher specimens under the aforementioned codes have been deposited in the University of Mississippi. Smenospongia aureaandS. cerebriformiswere homogenized and incubated withV. rigidain ethanol for a week. The dried ethanol extract (3.6 kg) of the mixture of three sponges was subjected to silica gel VLC (36 kg, 14 (H) * 17.5 (D) cm) and eluted with a stepwise gradient of hexanes (100%), hexanes-acetone (80:20, 60:40, 50:50, 40:60, 20:80), acetone (100%), acetone-MeOH (80:20, 60:40, 50:50), MeOH (100%), MeOH-H2O (50:50), and H2O (100%) to give 13 fractions (Fr. 1-13). Fraction 10 (39.3 g) was further divided into nine fractions (Fr. 10-1-10-9) using silica gel VLC (12 (H) * 17.5 (D) cm) with a mixture of hexanes-acetone (95:5, 90:10, 85:15, 80:20), MeOH (100%), and MeOH-H2O (50:50). Fraction 10-7 (3.7 g) was applied to C18MPLC (15.5 * 4 cm) with an isocratic condition of MeOH-H2O (85:15) to yield six subfractions (Fr. 10-7-1-10-7-6). Fraction 10-7-3 (115.8 mg) was chromatographed over C18HPLC (250 * 21.20 mm, 10 um) with MeOH-H2O (83:17) to produce three fractions (Fr. 10-7-3-1-10-7-3-3). Fraction 10-7-3-2 (12.4 mg) was purified using C18HPLC (250 * 4.60 mm and 150 * 4.60 mm, 5 um, connected in line) with MeOH-H2O (75:25) to obtain2(2.2 mg,tR= 223 min) and a mixture of3and4(4.6 mg,tR= 208 min). Fraction 10-7-3-3 (9.7 mg) was subjected to C18HPLC (250 * 4.60 mm and 150 * 4.60 mm, 5 um, connected in line) with MeOH-H2O (78:22) followed by C18HPLC (250 * 4.60 mm, 5 um) with gradient conditions of MeOH-H2O (80:20 ? 100:0) for 120 min to afford1(1.8 mg,tR= 151 min). Fraction 10-7-1 was chromatographed over C18HPLC (250 * 21.20 mm, 10 um) with MeOH-H2O (78:22) to afford a mixture of6and7(1.6 mg,tR= 92 min) as well as5(1.5 mg,tR= 100 min). Fraction 10-5 was combined with Fr. 10-6 based on their similar TLC patterns and fractionated to generate seven subfractions (Fr. 10-6-1-10-6-7) by C18MPLC (15.5 * 4 cm) with an isocratic condition of MeOH-H2O (85:15). Fraction 10-6-2 was sequentially purified using C18HPLC (250 * 21.20 mm, 10 um) with MeOH-H2O (78:22), C18HPLC (250 * 4.60 mm, 5 um) with MeOH-H2O (75:25), and C18HPLC (250 * 4.60 mm, 5 um) with MeOH-H2O (73:27) to give8(1.1 mg). white, amorphous solid; [a]D25-29 (c0.1, MeOH); UV (MeOH) ? max295 nm;1H and13C NMR, see Table1; HRFABMSm/z384.2540 [M + H]+(calcd for C24H34NO3, 384.2539), 406.2357[M + Na]+(calcd for C24H33NO3Na, 406.2358). pale yellow, amorphous solid; [a]D25+22 (c0.1, MeOH); UV (MeOH) ? max294 nm;1H and13C NMR, see Table1; HRFABMSm/z384.2542 [M + H]+(calcd for C24H34NO3, 384.2539). yellow, amorphous solid; [a]D25+21 (c0.1, MeOH); UV (MeOH) ? max297 nm;1H and13C NMR, see Table1; HRFABMSm/z398.2696 [M + H]+(calcd for C25H36NO3, 398.2695), 420.2509 [M + Na]+(calcd for C25H35NO3Na, 420.2515). yellow, amorphous solid; [a]D25-91 (c0.1, MeOH); UV (MeOH) ? max246, 283 nm;1H and13C NMR, see Table1; HRFABMSm/z405.2638 [M + H]+(calcd for C24H37O5, 405.2641), 427.2464 [M + Na]+(calcd for C24H36O5Na, 427.2460). yellow, amorphous solid; [a]D25+5 (c0.1, MeOH); UV (MeOH) ? max247, 287 nm;1H and13C NMR, see Table1; HRFABMSm/z405.2637 [M + H]+(calcd for C24H37O5, 405.2641), 427.2463 [M + Na]+(calcd for C24H36O5Na, 427.2460). dark yellow, amorphous solid; [a]D25+39 (c0.1, MeOH); UV (MeOH) ? max288 nm;1H and13C NMR, see Table1; HRFABMSm/z373.2381 [M + H]+(calcd for C23H33O4, 373.2379), 395.2203 [M + Na]+(calcd for C23H32O4Na, 395.2198). All conformational searches were implemented using the Macromodel (version 9.9, Schrodinger LLC) program with "mixed torsional/low mode sampling" in the MMFF force field. The searches were conducted in the gas phase with a 50 kJ/mol energy window limit and 10?000 maximum number of steps to thoroughly examine all low-energy conformers. The Polak-Ribiere conjugate gradient method was utilized for minimization processes with 10?000 maximum iterations and a 0.001 kJ (mol A)-1convergence threshold on the rms gradient. Conformers within 10 kJ/mol of each global minimum of compounds (i.e., compounds1-4in Figure1and diastereomersI-IVin Figure5) were used for GIAO shielding constant calculations without geometry optimization employing the Gaussian 09 package (Gaussian Inc.) at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level in the gas phase. Calculated chemical shift values were acquired based on the following equation: dcalcdNone= (s0- sNone)/(1 - s0/106), in which dcalcdNoneis the calculated chemical shift value for nucleusx(e.g.,1H or13C) and sNoneand s0are the calculated isotropic constants for nucleusxand tetramethylsilane (TMS), respectively. In particular, the geometry of TMS was optimized using the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level in the gas phase using the Gaussian 09 package (Gaussian Inc.) for unbiased and consistent comparison of calculated chemical shift values with those of other molecules in this study according to the original authors' recommendation. NoneThese calculated chemical shift values of compounds1-4and diastereomersI-IVwere averaged based on their Boltzmann populations (Tables S1-S4,Supporting Information) and used for calculations of CP3 and DP4 analysis employing applets available athttp://www-jmg.ch.cam.ac.uk/tools/nmr/andhttp://www-jmg.ch.cam.ac.uk/tools/nmr/DP4/, respectively. In application of the statistical analyses, calculated and experimental chemical shift values of diastereotopic protons were compared with their closest matches based on the original author's recommendation. NoneThe 3D images in Figure2were illustrated utilizing Pymol 1.6.x (Schrodinger LLC.). HEK293 (human embryonic kidney cell), HCT116 (human colon carcinoma), and SW480 (human colon adenocarcinoma) cells were acquired from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 120 ug/mL penicillin, and 200 ug/mL streptomycin. HEK293-FL reporters (TOPFlash) and controls (FOPFlash) were established as described previously. None,NoneThe Wnt3a-CM was prepared as described previously. NoneThe luciferase assay was implemented using the Dual Luciferase Assay kit (Promega, Fitchburg, WI, USA). The hFz-1 cDNA was constructed with reference to a previous protocol. NoneThe pTOPFlash and pFOPFlash reporter plasmids were purchased from Millipore Corporation (Billerica, MA, USA). The cytosolic fraction was generated as described previously. NoneProteins were separated utilizing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in a 4% to 12% gradient gel (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk and probed with anti-beta-catenin (BD Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY, USA) and anti-actin antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA). The membranes were incubated with horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG or anti-rabbit IgG and visualized employing the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA). The HCT116 and SW480 cells were inoculated into 96-well plates and treated with compounds1-8for 48 h. The cell viability from each treated sample was assessed in triplicate using a CellTiter-Glo assay kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
