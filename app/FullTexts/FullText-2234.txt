Renal fibrosis is the frequent final outcome of a wide variety of progressive chronic kidney diseases (1). Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a central mechanism in tubulointerstitial fibrosis, in which tubular epithelial cell loss is accompanied by the deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) and accumulation of fibroblasts and inflammatory cells in the intersitium (2-5). The phenotypic conversion of epithelial cells to myofibroblast (with expression of vimentin and less expression of E-cadherin) is the main feature of this process (6). Increasing evidence suggests that numerous genes are involved in tubular EMT (7-10). The transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta/Smad pathway is a key promoter of this process (11,12). Increased glomerular expression of TGF-beta has been reported in experimental and human kidney disease (1,5,13). Mice with increased plasma TGF-beta1 levels exhibited enhanced renal fibrosis (14). Through the induction of target genes, TGF-beta signaling promotes fibroblast survival and proliferation. The range of TGF-beta-target genes include microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) (15). miRNAs are small (21-23-nt) non-coding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression by interacting with multiple mRNAs and inducing translational suppression or degradation of mRNA (16). miRNAs are involved in regulating diverse physiological processes ranging from embryogenesis, organ development, oncogenesis and the initial step in EMT (17-19). Three miRNA families,miR-21,miR-200andmiR-29, are regulated by TGF-beta and have been shown to modulate renal fibrosis either by amplifying TGF-beta signaling and promoting fibrosis (miR-21) or by inhibiting EMT and reducing fibrosis (miR-29andmiR-200) (20-22). Five members of themiR-200family identified thus far aremiR-200a,miR-200b,miR-200c,miR-429andmiR-141. Published data suggest that themiR-200family inhibit EMT through directly targeting zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox (ZEB)-1andZEB-2, which are E-cadherin transcriptional repressors in kidney tubular cells (23). Therefore, approaches to correct miRNA expression represent the novel therapeutic strategies for these diseases. Homeodomain interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2) is a member of an evolutionary conserved family of serine/threonine kinases (24), which is considered as a tumor suppressor gene and mediates the activation of Wnt, Notch, and TGF-beta-induced signaling (25-27). HIPK2 is also considered as a co-regulator of an increasing number of transcription factors modulating numerous different basic cellular processes, including apoptosis, proliferation, differentiation and development (24,28-30). Recently, HIPK2 has also been identified as a key regulator in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and kidney fibrosis (31,32). In the kidney, HIPK2 mediates apoptosis and EMT of renal tubular epithelial cells, contributing to fibrosis. HIPK2 may be a potential target for anti-fibrosis therapy (31). Given the ability of themiR-200family to inhibit EMT and the evidence of HIPK2 in tissue fibrosis, whethermiR-141ameliorates tubulointerstitial fibrosis was investigated by inhibition of EMT through targeting HIPK2. In the present study, the first aim was to define a role ofmiR-141in regulating EMT in TGF-beta-treated human kidney 2 (HK-2) cells (normal renal tubular epithelial cells). miR-141hindered EMT by upregulating E-cadherin and downregulating vimentin and fibroblast-specific protein 1 (FSP1) expression through direct targeting of HIPK2, by binding to its three prime untranslated region (3'-UTR). HK-2 cell lines were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA) and maintained in RPMI-1640 medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 100 U/ml penicillin and 100mug/ml streptomycin in a humidified 5% CO2incubator at 37 degrees C. Ectopic expression ofmiR-141in HK-2 cells was achieved by transfection withmiR-141mimics (Genepharma, Shanghai, China) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Overexpression ofHIPK2was performed using theHIPK2ORF expression clone (GeneCopoecia, Guangzhou, China). Total RNA was extracted using the Trizol reagent as recommended by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). RNA quality and concentration were evaluated by spectrophotometry using a NanoDrop 2000c instrument (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA). For miRNA analysis, maturemiR-141was detected using a Hairpin-itTM miRNAs qPCR Quantitation kit (GenePharma, Shanghai, China). U6served as an internal reference. ForHIPK2mRNA analysis, qPCR was performed using the Power SYBR-Green PCR master mix (Takara, Dalian, China) on an ABI 7900HT PCR machine (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), and data were normalized tobeta-actin and further normalized to the negative control, unless otherwise indicated. Data analysis was performed using the 2-DeltaDeltaCtmethod. Human recombinant TGF-beta1 was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (no. 8915; Danvers, MA, USA), reconstituted in 20 mM citrate (pH 3.0) at a concentration of 100mug/ml. Further dilution was made in PBS containing 2 mg/ml albumin, stored at -20 degrees C for future use. Whole cell lysates were collected in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Protein concentration was measured using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific). Reduced protein (10-30mug) in Laemmli sample buffer was resolved using 6-12% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Membranes were blocked with 5% skimmed dry milk (Bio-Rad) in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) with 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) buffer for 1 h at room temperature, incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 degrees C, followed by the appropriate secondary immunoglobulin G antibody; anti-mouse, rabbit-horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad). Membranes were washed thoroughly between steps using TBST, and developed using the ECL Western blotting detection kit (Bio-Rad). All the primary antibodies used were from Cell Signaling Technology. The antibodies used were the following: HIPK2 (no. 5091), vimentin (no. 5741), FSP1 (no. 13018), E-cadherin (no. 3195) and beta-actin (no. 4967). The blots were stripped using stripping buffer (Thermo Scientific) prior to reprobing. beta-actin was used as an endogenous protein for normalization. Images were analyzed by Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). The 3'-UTR forHIPK2was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA extracted from HK-2 cells. The PCR primers used to amplify theHipk23'-UTR were forward, 5'-CTCGAGACACTTTGCATAACGTATA-3'; and reverse, 5'-GCGGCCGCATTGGAACAGTAGTCATAT-3', whereas the primers used to amplify the mutantHipk23'-UTR (with a mutant seed sequence of miR-141) were forward, 5'-TTCAAATGAATATTTCGTCTAAATAAATAAAG-3'; and reverse, 5'-TGTAGACGAAATATTCATTTGAATTTTCAAG-3'. The mutantHipk23'-UTR was identical to the wild-type sequence except for the seed regions, in which the complementary sequence was used. The mutant version was generated using the Stratagene QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis strategy (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA). Amplified 3'-UTRs were cloned downstream of the luciferase coding region in the psiCECKTM-2 vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The fidelity of all the constructs utilized in the study was confirmed by sequencing (ABI PRISM 377 automated sequencer; Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China) and subsequent sequence alignment (NCBI BLAST) using GenBankTM accession gene ID 28996. To assess the effect ofmiR-141on reporter activity, HK-2 cells were seeded in 96-well clusters 24 h prior to transfection. The following day, medium was replaced with OptiMEM (Invitrogen), and cells were co-transfected with 100 ng reporter plasmids along with 100 ng controlRnilla-luciferase plasmid and either scrambled control miRNA (Vector) ormiR141(miR-141Sponge) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The cells were collected 48 h post-transfection and luciferase activity was detected using a dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). All the experiments were performed in triplicate, and each experiment was repeated at least three times. Values are shown as mean +/- standard error, unless otherwise specified. SPSS 17.0 (Pearson; SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used to analyze data by unpaired studentttest or by analysis of variance. P less than 0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference. To study EMT, TGF-beta1-induced EMT was used in the HK-2 cells. Exposure of HK-2 cells to TGF-beta1 (2 ng/ml) for 48 h resulted in a significant decreased expression of the epithelial marker, E-cadherin, and increased expression of mesenchymal markers, vimentin and FSP1 (Fig. 1A; lane 1 compared to lane 3; lane 2 compared to lane 4). These hallmark shifts at the molecular level indicate a successful EMT program in HK-2 cells. miR-200is enriched in the kidney and lung, where it functions to maintain epithelial differentiation. Among the fivemiR-200family members,miR-200aandmiR-141share the same seed sequence, AACACU. Therefore, these two members may have the same mRNA targets. A recent study found thatmiR-200asignificantly influenced the development and progression of TGF-beta-dependent EMT and fibrosisin vitroandin vivo(33). To study the actions ofmiR-141in the regulation of EMT, HK-2 cells were transfected withmiR-141and changes of the gene expression were compared with the negative scrambled control (miR-SCR). As shown inFig. 1A(lane 3 verses lane 4), HK-2 cells transfected withmiR-141responded to TGF-beta1 treatment with greater than 70% reduction of vimentin (Fig. 1B) and FSP1 expression (Fig. 1C), and greater than 50% increase of E-cadherin expression (Fig. 1D) as compared to the control. Overall, these results indicate thatmiR-141is capable of functionally disrupting the EMT switch in HK-2 cell by maintaining relative high levels of E-cadherin expression, which is consistent with previous studies reporting that themiR-200family inhibits EMT by targeting E-cadherin transcriptional repressors (23,34). TGF-beta1 downregulates the expression of miR-141 accompanied by upregulation of HIPK2. Previous published data reported that treatment with TGF-beta1 lead to decreased expression of themiR-200family, includingmiR-141(33). Therefore, qPCR analysis was used to reveal that the expression ofmiR-141was significantly downregulated in HK-2 cell following TGF-beta1 treatment in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 2A and B). The expression ofmiR-141was reduced to less than 30% of the pretreatment level within 48 h of TGF-beta1 exposure (Fig. 2B). These results confirm that TGF-beta1 treatment lead to decreased expression ofmiR-141. A published systematic approach identified HIPK2 as a key regulator of renal fibrosis (31). Another recent study implicated dysregulated HIPK2 levels in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) (32). Therefore, the role of HIPK2 in TGF-beta1 treated HK-2 cells was investigated. Initial qPCR demonstrated TGF-beta1-mediated induction of HIPK2 in HK-2 kidney tubular cells (Fig. 2C and D) in a dose- and time-dependent manner, which corresponded to the decreasedmiR-141expression. To verify the induction of HIPK2, the expression was analyzed by western blotting in HK-2 cells. As shown inFig. 2E and F, HK-2 cells exposed to different dose of TGF-beta1 for 2 days increased the expression of HIPK2 significantly. The maximalHIPK2mRNA and protein expression levels at 4 ng/ml TGF-beta1 treatment were ~1.5-2-fold higher than the control. Furthermore, HK-2 cells exposed to TGF-beta1 (2 ng/ml) for 0-3 days also increased the expression of HIPK2 significantly (Fig. 2G and H). This result is consistent with the observation shown inFig. 2C and D, which means that the changes in HIPK2 expression were also observed at the protein level. Collectively, these results indicated that lower expression levels ofmiR-141were significantly associated with higher levels ofHIPK2mRNA and protein expression in the same set of TGF-beta1 treatment HK-2 cells. Dysregulation of HIPK2 has been implicated in increased proliferation, as it is typical in cancer or fibrosis (35,36). A recently published study identified HIPK2 as a key regulator of kidney fibrosis (31). Whether HIPK2 was sufficient to induce EMT in the absence of TGF-beta1 and what the potential role ofmiR-141was during this process were investigated. Transient expression ofHIPK2ORF in HK-2 cells resulted in a considerable upregulation of HIPK2 expression to 2.0+/-0.2-fold (Fig. 3A and B) accompanied by the gain of mesenchymal markers, vimentin and FSP1, and the loss expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin (Fig. 3C; lanes 1 and 2). Co-transfection ofmiR-141with theHIPK2ORF clone partially restored E-cadherin expression and attenuated vimentin and FSP1 induction (Fig. 3C; lanes 2 and 4). These results are consistent with our previous results that downregulation ofmiR-141is accompanied by upregulation of HIPK2 during TGF-beta1-induced EMT in HK-2 cells. Therefore, downregulation ofmiR-141appears to be required for mediating the upregulation of HIPK2 in the EMT process. HIPK2 can mimic the TGF-beta1-induced EMT process in HK-2 cells. The critical role ofmiR-141in EMT prompted the identification of the genes that were directly regulated bymiR-141. Whether overexpression ofmiR-141would alter HIPK2 protein expression was initially determined. As shown inFig. 4A and C, transfecting withmiR-141increased expression ofmiR-141to ~2.3-fold, compared to the transfection of miR-SCR in the HK-2 cells. This increase inmiR-141expression decreased HIPK2 expression to an average of 50+/-5% in the three experiments (Fig. 4D). Based on this observation, we hypothesize that themiR-141inhibitor (miR-141Sponge) should not be able to decrease HIPK2 expression. To test this hypothesis, HK-2 cells were transfected with either vector ormiR-141Sponge and HIPK2 protein expression was determined. The overexpression ofmiR-141Sponge caused a downregulation of themiR-141levels to ~0.5-fold compared to the transfection of the vector in the HK-2 cells (Fig. 4B and E). Consequently, the decreased expression ofmiR-141caused upregulation of HIPK2 expression, with an average of 1.5+/-0.1-fold in three experiments (Fig. 4F). Therefore, the expression of HIPK2 was significantly decreased inmiR-141-transfected cells. Taken together, TGF-beta1 (Fig. 2) andmiR-141inhibitor (miR-141Sponge) caused a similar effect on HIPK2 expression in HK-2 cells. AsmiR-141andHIPK23'-UTR share the same seed sequence as shown (Fig. 5A), whether HIPK2 is the direct target ofmiR-141on translational repression was further investigated. In these experiments, luciferase reporter constructs were used, incorporating a wild-type or mutant 3'-UTR ofHIPK2in which the sequence corresponding to the seed region was altered. Co-transfection of wild-typeHIPK2luciferase reporter construct or mutant 3'-UTR ofHIPK2withmiR-141or miR-SCR in HK-2 cells resulted in a significantly reducedHIPK23'-UTR luciferase activity expression. This demonstrated thatmiR-141directly repressed luciferase activity with the wild-type 3'-UTR ofHIPK2(Fig. 5B), but not with the mutant 3'-UTR. By contrast,miR-141Sponge increased luciferase activity with the wild-typeHIPK2, but not with the mutant version ofHIPK2(Fig. 5C). Tubular EMT is a series of highly-regulated pathological events, which is one of the major mechanisms leading to renal fibrosis (1,5,13,37). miRNAs are recognized to be critical regulators of a number of important developmental, homeostatic and pathogenic pathways. Recent findings suggest that miRNAs are essential for kidney development and homeostasis. ThemiR-200family members were clearly downregulated in cells that had undergone EMT in response to TGF-beta, and the expression of themiR-200family alone was sufficient to prevent TGF-beta-induced EMT (38). The study by Tamagawaet al(34) demonstrated the role ofmiR-200c/miR-141in the regulation of EMT and migration in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. However, the functional involvement ofmiR-141in EMT associated with tubulointerstitial fibrosis, as well as direct targeting bymiR-141, has not been investigated. In the present study,miR-141influenced the progression of TGF-beta1-induced EMTin vitro. An EMT model was initially established using TGF-beta1-treated HK-2 cells by observing upregulation of vimentin and FSP1 and downregulation of E-cadherin (Fig. 1A; lanes 1 and 3) at the protein levels. Overexpression ofmiR-141inhibited EMT progression in TGF-beta1-treated HK-2 cells by maintaining high E-cadherin expression levels and low vimentin and FSP1 expression levels (Fig. 1A; lanes 3 and 4). Furthermore,miR-141was found to be downregulated during TGF-beta1-induced EMT in HK-2 cells (Fig. 2). Given that reducedmiR-141levels are associated with increased EMT expression, and that restoring expression ofmiR-141prevents EMT in HK-2 cells,miR-141appears to play an important role in EMT, and therefore, renal fibrosis. Wanget al(33) also found that in early and more advanced models of kidney disease, the downregulation ofmiR-141was also associated with increased TGF-beta expression and renal scarring. Additionally, downregulated expression ofmiR-141was accompanied by upregulatedHIPK2expression (Fig. 2). These observations suggest a possible regulatory network that drives the increased expression of HIPK2 during TGF-beta1-induced EMT, perspectives that warrant further investigation. Although a number of different factors contribute to renal fibrosis, the most known and studied profibrotic agent is TGF-beta1, which is increased in the diabetic kidney (39). Recently, HIPK2 has been also identified as a main regulator of kidney fibrosis (31). In the kidney, HIPK2 mediates apoptosis and EMT of renal tubular epithelial cells, contributing to fibrosis (31). In the present study, overexpression ofHIPK2resulted in the upregulation of vimentin and FSP1, and downregulation of E-cadherin (Fig. 3), which indicates that HIPK2 mimicked TGF-beta1-induced EMT in HK-2 cells. These initial studies suggested that overexpression ofmiR-141inhibited TGF-beta1-induced EMT (Fig. 1). Given the possible link betweenmiR-141and HIPK2, whether overexpression ofmiR-141hindered HIPK2 expression in HK-2 cells was investigated further. To test this hypothesis, miR-SCR ormiR-141were transfected with either vector or theHIPK2ORF clone and the EMT markers expression was determined. The ability ofmiR-141to attenuate HIPK2 expression has potential implications and may prove to be an attractive option for targeting the EMT pathway. Certain miRs are well known to be indiscriminate and may bind to the UTR regions of a number of different genes. The results of the present study showed that overexpression ofmiR-141significantly reduced the expression of HIPK2 (Fig. 4), and therefore, it is possible that the 3'-UTR of HIPK2 may harbor a target site formiR-141. The TargetScan database indicated that HIPK2 had a target site formiR-141, as shown inFig. 5A. In the study,miR-141was shown to be a direct repressor of HIPK2 as it targeted the 3'-UTR of this gene, as shown by experiments using the wild-type and mutant HIPK2 3'-UTR-luciferase constructs. HIPK2 was a transcriptional cofactor in the downstream TGF-beta/BMP signaling pathway (27,31,40-42). Notably, loss of HIPK2 reduced cellular responses to TGF-beta during neuronal development and in mouse models of renal fibrosis (27,40). In addition, the present experimental results confirmed that HIPK2 was a functional target ofmiR-141in HK-2 cells. There are several lines of evidence to support this. Firstly, protein expression of HIPK2 was significantly decreased in themiR-141group compared to the miR-SCR group (Fig. 4). Overexpression ofmiR-141significantly downregulated HIPK2 by directly targeting the 3'UTR ofHIPK2mRNA, confirmed using the luciferase reporter-gene assays (Fig. 5). This effect was largely eliminated when the sites inHIPK23'UTR targeted bymiR-141were mutated. Overexpression ofHIPK2mimicked TGF-beta1-induced EMT, and overexpression ofmiR-141rescued the expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin and inhibited HIPK2-induced EMT (Fig. 3C and F; lanes 3 and 4). These results strongly suggested thatmiR-141, through directly targeting ofHIPK2, plays an essential role in renal proximal tubular EMT. miR-141suppresses the expression ofHIPK2through directly interacting with its wild-type 3'-UTR. In the present study, ectopic expression ofmiR-141hindered the progression of EMT in TGF-beta1-treated HK-2 cells by downregulation of HIPK2 expression, maintaining a high expression level of E-cadherin. Since HIPK2 has been indicated to be involved in the progression of EMT by suppression of E-cadherin expression, it may provide important targets for therapeutic strategies. The findings in the study suggested thatmiR-141was downregulated in TGF-beta1-treated HK-2 cells. This not only reveals a close association between themiR-141expression level and epithelial phenotypic conversion, but also implicates a potential role ofmiR-141in the regulation of tubular dedifferentiation, which is a frequent pathogenesis in tubular interstitial fibrosis in a number of types of chronic kidney disease. Evidently, more studies are required to further characterize the role ofmiR-141in the pathogenesis of EMT, as well as to depict detailed molecular pathways that are involved in EMT and kidney fibrosis following chronic renal injury. In conclusion, the present results indicate thatmiR-141coordinately regulates the TGF-beta1-induced EMT process through the HIPK2 signaling pathway (Fig. 6) and exogenous overexpression ofmiR-141may represent a promising approach for targeted kidney fibriosis therapies.
