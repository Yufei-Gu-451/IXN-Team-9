Cutaneous and ocular melanomas affect people worldwide and are associated with significant mortality (SinghNone, 2005;SiegelNone, 2012;FlahertyNone, 2012a). Currently, cure is achievable only in patients with localised disease. Once metastatic spread occurs, the prognosis is poor. Cutaneous melanoma is characterised by activating driver mutations in genes such asBRAF(DaviesNone, 2002),NRAS(BallNone, 1994), andKIT(CurtinNone, 2006), and recurrent losses of specific tumour suppressors such asCDKN2AandPTEN(CurtinNone, 2005). In patients with certain genetic subsets of melanoma, recently introduced therapies such as BRAF inhibitors improve survival, even in advanced disease (ChapmanNone, 2011;HauschildNone, 2012;FlahertyNone, 2012b). Uveal melanomas arise from the iris, ciliary body, or choroid of the eye. They comprise ?90% of ocular melanomas and are genetically distinct from cutaneous melanoma. They are characterised by activating somatic mutations in eitherGNAQorGNA11(Van RaamsdonkNone, 2009,2010). Based on gene expression profiles, uveal melanomas may be subdivided into two prognostic groups, termed class 1 (good prognosis) or class 2 (poor prognosis) (TschentscherNone, 2003;OnkenNone, 2004). Class 1 tumours frequently harbourSF3B1mutations (HarbourNone, 2013), whereas class 2 tumours typically show chromosomal monosomy 3 (PrescherNone, 1996), as well as inactivatingBAP1mutations (HarbourNone, 2010). Conjunctival melanomas, unlike uveal melanomas, frequently harbourBRAFandNRASmutations and copy number alterations reminiscent of cutaneous and mucosal melanoma (GearNone, 2004;SpendloveNone, 2004;Goldenberg-CohenNone, 2005;LakeNone, 2011;GriewankNone, 2013). Their clinical behaviour also differs from uveal melanoma and is similar to that of cutaneous melanomas (ZembowiczNone, 2010;HarooniNone, 2011;ShieldsNone, 2011). Recently two studies showed that up to 71% of cutaneous melanomas harboured novel mutations in the promoter region ofTERT, coding for the catalytic subunit of the telomerase holoenzyme (HornNone, 2013;HuangNone, 2013). These mutations were shown to lead to increasedTERTexpression, most likely by creating ETS transcription-factor-binding sites (HornNone, 2013;HuangNone, 2013). An additional study foundTERTpromoter mutations in a wide array of different human cancers, including bladder cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and different types of gliomas (KillelaNone, 2013). They associated high frequencies ofTERTpromoter mutations, with tumours arising in tissues having low rates of self-renewal. The frequency ofTERTpromoter mutations in ocular melanomas has not been analysed. Here, we investigated the presence ofTERTpromoter mutations in ocular melanomas including conjunctival and uveal melanomas. Ocular melanoma samples were obtained from patients treated in the Department of Ophthalmology for conjunctival or uveal (choroidal or ciliary body) melanoma, as well as from the tissue archives of the Departments of Ophthalmology, Pathology, and Dermatology, University Hospital Essen, Germany, and the Department of Ophthalmology, University Hospital Tubingen, Germany. The study was carried out in accordance with the guidelines set forth by the ethics committee of the University of Duisburg-Essen. Clinical and pathological details were obtained from patient records. A review of pathological slides was also performed to confirm the conjunctival origin of tumours and to assess the following: site(s) of tumour involvement (primarily or secondarily); pathological stage; the presence of associated lesions such as conjunctival naevus and primary acquired melanosis; and pigmentation (presence of melanin pigment in the cytoplasm of tumour cells). Conjunctival naevus was defined as an acquired junctional or compound proliferation of benign melanocytes, usually in a nested pattern, in the conjunctiva. Primary acquired melanosis was defined clinically as flat, speckled brown lesions of the conjunctiva, and histologically as hyperpigmentation of conjunctival epithelium without melanocytic hyperplasia, or melanocytic hyperplasia in conjunctival epithelium with or without cytologic atypia. Ten-micrometre thick sections were cut from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumour tissues. The sections were deparaffinised and manually macrodissected according to the standard procedures. Genomic DNA was isolated using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Samples of fresh frozen tissue were directly applied to the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit. Uveal melanoma sample DNA isolation and determination of chromosome 3 status by microsatellite analysis were performed as previously described (ThomasNone, 2012). Nested PCR was performed to amplifyBRAFexons 11 and 15 andNRASexons 1 and 2, and sequenced as previously described (HoubenNone, 2004). A 474-base pair region of theTERTpromoter region was amplified using the following primers: hTERT_F 5'-ACGAACGTGGCCAGCGGCAG-3' and hTERT_R 5'-CTGGCGTCCCTGCACCCTGG-3'. For amplification of DNA from formalin-fixed material, primers hTERT_short_F 5'-CAGCGCTGCCTGAAACTC-3' and hTERT_short_R 5'-GTCCTGCCCCTTCACCTT-3', which amplify a 163-bp fragment, were applied as previously described (HornNone, 2013). After purification with the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen), PCR products were used as templates for sequencing. The sequencing chromatogram files were examined, and mutations were identified using Chromas software (version 2.01, University of Sussex, Brighton, UK). The study cohort consisted of 50 uveal melanoma samples (which included 22 tumours with chromosome 3 disomy, and 28 tumours with chromosome 3 monosomy) randomly selected from a cohort of 374 tumours described previously (ThomasNone, 2012), and 43 conjunctival melanoma samples. All the samples were primary or recurrent tumours. Available clinical data of conjunctival melanoma are listed inTable 1andSupplementary Table 1. Sequence analysis failed in one and was ambiguous in two of the 50 uveal melanoma samples. In the remaining 47 samples (21 disomy 3, 26 monosomy 3), noTERTpromoter mutations were identified. Sequence analysis was successful in 38 of the 43 conjunctival melanomas, andTERTpromoter mutations were identified in 12 (32%) tumours. The mutations were located at positions Chr.5:1295228C greater than T (n=2, 5%), Chr.5:1295242_43delinsTT (n=2, 5%), and Chr.5:1295250C greater than T (n=8, 21%), as shown inFigure 1. Mutations will be further annotated using the last three digits of their chromosome location as 228C greater than T, 242CC greater than TT, and 250C greater than T respectively. All identifiedTERTpromoter mutations had a UV signature (C greater than T and CC greater than TT) (PleasanceNone, 2010). In eight cases, matched constitutional DNA isolated from peripheral blood was sequenced. None of these samples harboured theTERTpromoter mutations detected in the corresponding tumour DNA, verifying that the detected mutations were somatically acquired (Supplementary Figure 1). Successful sequencing ofBRAFandNRASwas performed in the conjunctival melanoma samples. Ten of the thirty-eight tumours (26%) harbouredBRAFmutations: nine p.V600E (c.1799T greater than A) and one p.G469A (c.1406G greater than C). Four (40%)BRAF-mutant samples had a concomitantTERTpromoter mutation (250C greater than T,n=2 and 228C greater than T,n=2). Mutations ofNRASwere present in five (13%) conjunctival melanomas, including three p.Q61R (c.182A greater than G) and two p.Q61K (c.181C greater than A) mutations. Three (60%)NRAS-mutant samples had concomitantTERTpromoter mutations (250C greater than T,n=3). An analysis with the available clinicopathological data was performed. Median follow-up duration was 39.2 months (3.2-171 months). Five (13%) patients were lost to follow-up. No statistically significant associations ofTERTpromoter mutation status with clinical and pathological parameters (age, sex, site of tumour involvement, clinical stage, pathological stage, associated lesion, and pigmentation) or with disease-free survival or overall survival were found (Table 1). Mutations of theTERTpromoter were quite frequent (32%) in conjunctival melanoma, but were not seen in uveal melanomas. The mutations identified in conjunctival melanoma are identical to those described in cutaneous melanoma (HornNone, 2013;HuangNone, 2013). They were found at the same hotspots and were mutually exclusive of each other. Additionally, all mutations showed a UV signature, consisting of C greater than T or CC greater than TT nucleotide changes (PleasanceNone, 2010). The frequencies ofTERTpromoter mutations reported in cutaneous melanoma vary significantly, probably in part due to varying sample selection (type of melanomas, primary or metastatic samples, and so on). The mutation frequency of 33% reported byHornNone(2013)in primary cutaneous melanomas is very similar to the mutation rate of 32% detected in our cohort of conjunctival melanoma samples. This finding provides further evidence for a pathogenetic link between cutaneous and conjunctival melanomas. Further support for such a link derives from the frequency ofBRAFandNRASmutations, and similarity of clinical behaviour between these melanoma types. In our cohort of 38 conjunctival melanomas, there were no significant associations betweenTERTpromoter mutation status and clinicopathological parameters. Future studies with larger tumour cohorts will be required to validate these findings. Our results underline the distinct pathogenesis of uveal melanoma compared with other forms of melanoma. Mutations of theTERTpromoter join the list of genetic events such as mutations inBRAForNRASand losses ofPTENorCDKN2A,which are very common in cutaneous melanoma but are virtually never seen in uveal melanoma. Considering that correspondingly, almost all genetic events identified in uveal melanoma, such as mutations inGNAQ(Van RaamsdonkNone, 2009),GNA11(Van RaamsdonkNone, 2010),BAP1(HarbourNone, 2010), andSF3B1(HarbourNone, 2013), are rarely seen in cutaneous or mucosal melanoma; uveal melanomas potentially will be found to harbour their own unique set of recurrent mutations in regulatory DNA regions (that is, promoters, enhancers, and so on). KillelaNone(2013)found high frequencies ( greater than 15%) ofTERTpromoter mutations in tumours arising from tissues with low self-renewal capability. Our results suggest that this phenomenon may apply to conjunctival melanoma, as well as cutaneous melanoma. In certain cancers,KillelaNone(2013)reported alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) with inactivating mutations inATRXandDAXXas a mechanism for telomere maintenance inTERTpromoter mutation-negative samples. Alternative lengthening of telomeres has generally not been reported to be relevant in melanoma. Additionally, larger whole-exome sequencing studies both for cutaneous melanoma ((HodisNone, 2012;KrauthammerNone, 2012),n greater than 250) and uveal melanoma ((HarbourNone, 2013) and our own unpublished data,n=40) did not find recurrent mutations inATRXorDAXX. This argues against a relevant role for ALT in ocular melanoma. The role of UV-mediated tumourigenesis in ocular melanomas is yet to be resolved (Pane and Hirst, 2000;GuenelNone, 2001;SinghNone, 2004). The UV signature in the mutations identified in theTERTpromoter of conjunctival melanomas suggests a potential role for UV-induced genetic alterations in the pathogenesis of these tumours. Whether UV radiation contributes to the development of uveal melanomas is yet to be determined. In summary, the distribution ofTERTpromoter mutations in ocular melanoma provides further evidence that ocular melanomas comprise genetically distinct tumour groups. The presence ofTERTpromoter mutations with UV signatures in conjunctival melanomas supports an UV-induced pathogenesis and a pathogenetic kinship with cutaneous melanomas. Absence of these mutations in uveal melanomas emphasises their genetic distinction from cutaneous and conjunctival melanomas.
