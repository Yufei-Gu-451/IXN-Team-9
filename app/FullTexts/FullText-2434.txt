The term "cardiac glycosides"-often used interchangeably with "cardiotonic steroids"-refers to a class of steroidal natural products exhibiting positive inotropic activity. NoneThese molecules possess the capacity to increase the cardiac output through their inhibitory interaction with the extracellular surface of the membrane-bound sodium pump (Na+/K+-ATPase) through stabilization in the E2-P transition state, resulting in the increase of intracellular sodium concentration and the buildup of intracellular calcium concentration in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This process ultimately results in a more powerful contraction of the mycocyte. Cardiac glycosides possess several characteristic featuresNone(Figure1A): (i) glycosylation, if any, is found at the C3 position of the steroidal framework; (ii) in contrast to the common steroidal skeleton, both their A/B and C/D rings are ofcisconfiguration; (iii) a beta-configured tertiary alcohol is present at C14 (and often at C5); and finally, (iv) an unsaturated lactone ring is found at the C17 position. The C17 lactone domain further defines the subclass of cardiac glycosides: those with an unsaturated butyrolactone moiety, typically afforded by plant sources, are called cardenolides and those with an unsaturated 2-pyrone moiety, typically afforded by animal sources, are called bufadienolides. None(A) Structures of cardiotonic steroid ouabagenin (1) and its parent glycoside ouabain (2). (B) Interaction of ouabain (2) with borosilicate glassware. In 1888, a highly oxidized member of the cardenolide family, ouabain (2), was isolated by ArnaudNonefrom the roots and barks of the African ouabaio tree. Its aglycone, ouabagenin (1), was later isolated in 1942 by Mannich and Siewert,Nonewho also proposed the correct structure for the aglycone and the parent glycoside. These molecules have attracted considerable attention due to the discovery of naturally occurring ouabain (or a ouabain-like compound) in mammals. In fact, buildup of endogenous ouabain has recently been proposed as one genetic molecular mechanism for hypertension in animal models. NoneFrom a chemical synthesis point of view, the predominant beta-orientation of the hydroxyl groups of ouabagenin and ouabain presents an additional layer of complexity as ouabain (2) has been reported to undergo facile complexation with borosilicate glassware (Figure1B). NoneOur laboratory became enamored with cardiotonic steroids for both chemical and biological reasons. Chemically, there was no scalable solution (semisynthetic or fully synthetic) to the synthesis of highly oxygenated steroid systems such as ouabain (2), thus presenting an opportunity for innovation. From a biological vantage point, we were interested in the medicinal chemistry of highly oxygenated steroids that would result from such an effort. This full account traces the evolution of our synthetic strategy that ultimately led to a scalable solution to the puzzle posed by the ouabain problem and enabled initial medicinal chemistry explorations of uniquely oxidized steroid derivatives. Ouabain and related natural products are classic targets for synthesis. Semisynthesis campaigns for the preparation of the cardenolides and the related bufadienolides date back to the early 1970s with the landmark synthesis of batrachotoxininNoneby Werhli and co-workers. Since then, numerous synthetic efforts have resulted in the semisynthesis of strophanthidol and its parent glycoside (strophanthidin) by Yoshii,Nonethe semisynthesis of digitoxigenin by WiesnerNoneand Kabat,Noneand bufalin by WiesnerNoneand Yoshii. NoneIn addition, the first total synthesis of digitoxigeninNonewas reported by Stork and co-workers in 1996, and the total synthesis of rhodexin ANonewas achieved by Jung and co-workers in 2011. More recently, an elegant total synthesis of 19-hydroxysarmentogenin starting from carvone was disclosed by Inoue and co-workers. NoneSynthetic studies toward the most oxidized members of the cardenolide family, ouabagenin (1) and ouabain (2), have also been conducted, culminating in a landmark total synthesis of these compounds in 2008 by Deslongchamps and co-workers featuring a polyanionic cascade as the key skeletal construction step (Scheme1). NoneIn addition, other elegant approaches have been developed, including a novel Heck annulation by Overman and co-workers,Noneand a Diels-Alder approach by Jung and co-workers. NoneGiven the success of pharmaceutical research on semisynthetic steroids, we anticipated that a semisynthetic approach would be the most viable means to achieve a scalable synthesis of ouabagenin (1). With pragmatic considerations in mind, our retrosynthetic analysis used a "look-ahead" approachNonecommencing with readily available cortisone acetate (9; Figure2). This starting material was chosen because of (i) its bulk availability at a reasonable cost ($1.2/g); (ii) the existence of "pre-built" oxidations at C3 and C11, which would facilitate access to the requisite hydroxyl groups at these two carbons; and (iii) the facile cleavage of the C17-C20 bond to give a ketone moiety at C17,Nonewhich would provide us with a functional handle for the butenolide appendage. Preliminary strategic considerations for elaboration of the A ring. An overwhelming amount of literature evidence has suggested that the A ring of a steroid skeleton exhibits higher reactivity than the rest of the tetracyclic framework. NoneThus, we posited that the A ring be fully elaborated before the rest of the molecule in the approach toward ouabagenin (1). Several scenarios exist for the elaboration of the A ring using the putative steroid intermediate10derived from cortisone acetate (9) following C17-C20 cleavage (Figure2). Given the multitude of hydroxyl groups to be introduced, a "pre-built" oxidation state within the A ring would be desirable. In pathwaya, it is envisioned that either the C1 or C5 hydroxyl group could be introduced via selective hydration of the dienone moiety. However, introduction of the hydroxyl group at C19 would still be problematic due to the geometrically unfavorable 1,4-relationship to the requisite hydroxyl group at either C1 or C5. NoneThe same problem would also be encountered with the use of the hydroxyl group at C3 to direct oxidation onto the C19 position, as they exist in a 1,6-relationship (pathwayc). Literature evidence suggested that C19 functionalization by way of alkoxy radical generation at C3 proceeded only in poor yield. NoneThus, it is apparent that the oxidation at the C19 carbon is unlikely to be accessed via the use of other functionalities on the A ring as directing groups, and would have to be attained via other means (pathwayb), preferably early in the synthesis. Installation of functionality at C19 is a classic unsolved problem in steroid chemistry dating back to the days of Woodward. NoneA representative panel of strategies that have been developed to solve this problem is shown in Scheme2. While the bromohydrin functionalization route (Scheme2A) is a well-established method to access the C19 oxidation in steroid semisynthesis literature, this strategy was not pursued due to the lengthiness of operations required. Our studies thus commenced with the reinvestigation of an intriguing report of metalloporphyrin-catalyzed hydroxylation of the steroidal C19 positionNoneas this would represent the most direct access to the desired C19-hydroxyl compound (Scheme2B). The described reaction utilized iron-porphyrin18in the presence ofN-methylimidazole and cumyl hydroperoxide to furnish hydroxylated product19in moderate yield among other oxidation products. In our hands, this result could not be reproduced, as17proved to be unreactive toward oxidation under the reported conditions. Disappointingly, the use of a more reactive perfluorinated iron-porphyrin catalystNoneresulted only in epoxidation of the C4-C5 olefin of17. Attention was then turned to a report from Rindone and co-workers (Scheme2C) of a direct dichloromethylation of estrone under aerobic reaction conditions with cobalt(II) salen as catalyst. NoneThis report was viewed as an alternative solution for the installation of the requisite oxidation state at the C19 position. In our hands, formation of two products was observed with NMR spectra identical to the ones reported by the authors. X-ray analysis, however, established that the reported dichloromethyl adduct22was instead an oxidized dimer of estrone (23). In the original publication, the structure of product22was established based on the presence of a singlet at 5.39 ppm by1H NMR spectroscopy. However, the actual structure of the product23suggests that this singlet belongs to theo-quinone proton. In addition, a multitude of conditions were attempted to effect apara-functionalization of estrone but most conditions only resulted in the formation ofortho-functionalized products. The preference forortho-functionalization could be rationalized by the high thermodynamic penalty associated with breaking the aromaticity of the A ring in thepara-functionalization pathway. These failures led us to retool our synthesis plan and consider the possibility of introducing the hydroxyl group at C19 with the use of an appropriate functionality embedded at the C11 carbon. Literature evidence suggested that hypoiodite photochemistry would lead to nonselective functionalizations of both C19 and C18 carbons. NoneOn the other hand, a Norrish type II photochemistry could pave the way for selective functionalization of the C19 methyl group (Scheme2D). Jeger and co-workers were able to introduce a hydroxyl moiety at C19 by first effecting a Norrish type II photochemistry to generate cyclobutanol25in modest yield, followed by an oxidative fragmentation with Pb(OAc)4. NoneEncouraged by this finding, we arrived at the final retrosynthesis for ouabagenin as depicted in Figure3. The general premise of this strategy was to relay the C17 and C19 ketone oxidation states to neighboring and distal carbon atoms. This so-called "redox-relay" approach would potentially simplify the installation of four hydroxyl groups (C1, C5, C14 and C19) and minimize functional group incompatibilities along the way. Butenolide installation at a late stage would result in target27and allow divergent exploration of D-ring substituents. Redox-relay from the C17 ketone would lead to28. Subsequent hydroxyl-directed bis-oxygenation (C1 and C5) simplifies the target to C19-oxygenated steroid29, which is essentially one oxidation away from readily available cortisone acetate (9). Final retrosynthetic analysis of ouabagenin. Oxidative cleavage of the C17-C20 bond of cortisone acetate (9) generated adrenosterone (30) in a straightforward manner (Scheme3). Preliminary photochemical investigations suggested that the presence of ketone moieties at C3 and C17 led to the formation of a complex mixture of products, presumably via competitive photoexcitation. Thus, we elected to convert these two ketone moieties to the corresponding ketals. Although31could be converted to the desired cyclobutanol32, the reaction gave only a modest yield of desired product (43%) and suffered from formation of undesired side products, most notably compound33, which arises from Norrish type I cleavage of the C9-C11 bond. Reagents and conditions: (a) NaBH4(0.6 equiv), 0 degrees C, 135 min; then NaIO4(5 equiv), 23 degrees C, 12 h, 86%; (b)p-TsOH (0.1 equiv), ethylene glycol (30 equiv), PhCH3, 135 degrees C, 6 h, 81%; (c)hnu, Vycor filter, 48-120 h; (d) Pb(OAc)4, C6H6, 80 degrees C, 1 h.In 2004, a total synthesis of herbertenolideNonewas accomplished by Garcia-Garibay and co-workers and featured for the first time the application of a solid-state Norrish type I photoreaction in total synthesis. Remarkably, the authors reported a highly chemoselective formation of cyclopentane35, which stood in stark contrast to the nonselective outcome obtained with conventional solution photochemistry (Scheme4A). In addition, Scheffer and co-workers also reported a highly differential outcome of a Norrish type II photoreactionNonewhen conducted in solution and in solid-state: significant improvement in the formation of cyclobutanols37and38was observed when solid-state photochemistry was employed in place of conventional solution photochemistry (Scheme4B). Encouraged by these precedents, we elected to conduct our photochemistry in the solid state. Gratifyingly, the use of solid-state photochemistry led to an appreciable increase in the yield of cyclobutanol formation (43% to 68%) while minimizing the formation of undesired alpha-cleavage product33(see Scheme3). Unfortunately, the oxidative fragmentation protocol described by Jeger proved unsuccessful on32as a complex mixture of products was observed, none of which corresponded to the desired C19-functionalized product29. Presumably, the C5-C6 olefin of32is incompatible with the strong oxidant/harsh conditions employed, leading to the formation of various undesired products. Following precedents by Snider, Phillips, and several other research groups,Nonea range of inorganic oxidants was also screened to effect the oxidative fragmentation of the C11-C19 bond, but none led to formation of the desired product (Scheme5A). It was then reasoned that a hypervalent iodine species could undergo a ligand exchange reaction with cyclobutanol32and the resulting adduct could then fragment oxidatively to give either a hydroxyl or an acetate group at C19. Unfortunately, no reaction was observed with both IBX and DMP even at elevated temperatures, and undesired fragmentation of the C9-C11 bond to hemiketal40and41was observed with PhI(OAc)2and hypoiodite photolysis conditions (I2/PhI(OAc)2), respectively. NoneReagents and conditions: (a) PhI(OAc)2(1.5 equiv), Ac2O, 80 degrees C, 3 h, 68%; (b)hnu, I2(1.5 equiv), PhI(OAc)2(2 equiv), CH2Cl2, 23 degrees C, 20 min, 61%; (c) Pd(OAc)2(0.2 equiv), PhI(OAc)2(1.5 equiv), Ac2O, 80 degrees C, 3 h.Building on precedents set by Uemura and co-workers,Nonewe next envisaged a palladium-mediated fragmentation reaction (Scheme5B). It was shown that cyclobutanols can be engaged in a beta-carbon elimination from the initial palladium(II) alcoholate adduct. Thus, it was hoped that the resulting metalloketone intermediate could be intercepted by an oxidant to generate a PdIVspecies, which would in turn undergo reductive elimination to furnish acetate45. To this end,32was heated with Pd(OAc)2and PhI(OAc)2, with Ac2O as solvent at 80 degrees C. The desired C19 functionalized compound45was indeed formed, albeit in minor amounts, validating our hypothesis (Scheme5C). The major product from this reaction turned out to be hemiketal40, indicating significant background reaction of the cyclobutanol with the oxidant itself. Unfortunately, despite extensive experimentations, we were not able to improve the yield of formation of acetate45. Eventually, the desired C19 functionalization was effected by using either Barluenga's reagentNoneorN-iodosuccinimideNoneunder photolytic conditions, with the latter being preferred simply due to the lower cost of the reagent. A proposed mechanism for this transformation is put forth in Figure4. In addition, since both conditionsNone(see Scheme5) andNone/None(see Figure4) should generate an identical hypoiodite intermediate, it is entirely possible that additives from the latter conditions exert subtle geometrical changes in the reaction transition state such that the O-I bond is anti-periplanar to the C11-C19 bond, leading to a chemoselective fragmentation to iodide47. NIS-assisted oxidative fragmentation and proposed mechanism. A and B show two conformations of the O-I bond, leading to the cleavage of different C-C bonds. With iodide47now in hand, selective deketalization at C3 was achieved by using TiCl4, and the iodide at C19 was hydrolyzed with AgOAc to furnish enone alcohol49(Scheme6). In contrast to a similar epoxidation with a simpler C19 methyl substrate,Noneepoxidation of the C4-C5 olefin proceeded in a completely diastereoselective fashion. Dehydrogenation of the C1-C2 bond was then achieved with SeO2to give50, as the use of other reagents such as IBXNoneor HIO3led to formation of over-oxidized products. Lastly, another diastereoselective epoxidation furnished diepoxide51, a landmark intermediateen routeto full elaboration of the A ring of ouabagenin (1). Reagents and conditions: (a)hnu,N-iodosuccinimide (3 equiv), Li2CO3(3.5 equiv), MeOH, PhCH3, 23 degrees C, 20 min, 85%; (b) TiCl4(1 M in CH2Cl2, 1 equiv), CH2Cl2, -10 degrees C, 15 min; AgOAc (1.5 equiv), THF, H2O, 50 degrees C, 2 h, 71%; (c) H2O2(35 wt% in H2O, 6 equiv), 3 M NaOH (1 equiv), MeOH, 0 degrees C, 75 min; (d) SeO2(1.1 equiv), PhCl, 90 degrees C, 10 h; (e) H2O2(35 wt% in H2O, 6 equiv), 3 M NaOH (1 equiv), MeOH, 0 degrees C, 75 min, 50% (over three steps); (f) conc. HCl (1 equiv), CH2Cl2, 23 degrees C, 1 h, 87%. As was observed by Jung and co-workers in their model study,Nonereductive opening of diepoxide51proved to be daunting. A wide range of conditionsNone(Table1) were tried, but most conditions resulted only in the formation of regioisomeric mixtures of A-ring enones. Hydrogenation conditions (entry 10), despite multiple precedents by Porco,Noneled to reduction of the C3 ketone while leaving the two epoxides intact. Gram-scale reaction. Gratifyingly, triol54was accessible via treatment of51within situ-generated aluminum amalgam. Poor conversion to54was observed when this reaction was run in the more conventional biphasic solvent mixture, leading to an extensive solvent screening for the reaction (entries 11-20), which eventually revealed saturated NaHCO3as the optimal medium (entries 14 and 15). It is worth noting that with these "on-water" conditions,Nonewe observed formation of over-reduced product57, suggesting that this aqueous medium provided a higher reduction potential for the reagent than conventional organic solvents. Cognizant of the ligating ability of the A ring of ouabain (2),Nonewe elected to introduce an appropriate protecting group on the A ring. While attempts to tie the three hydroxyl groups in54as an orthoformate were unsuccessful, clean acetonide formation could be effected in acidic acetone to form58. Reduction of the C3 ketone of58with LiBEt3H (Scheme7) proceeded in a completely diastereoselective fashion and also protected the remaining two free hydroxyl moieties as the boronate ester to give59. NoneThe ketone moiety of the C ring was next reduced under thermodynamic conditions (Li/NH3) to furnish an alpha-configured alcohol at C11. Following deketalization, the C17 ketone moiety of60was subjected to Saegusa oxidation to provide the corresponding conjugated enone. Isomerization of the olefin at C15-C16 out of conjugation could be effected with a SiO2/iPr2EtN mixture to give61,Nonealthough this necessitated the use of octafluorotoluene as solvent in order to minimize undesired epimerization of the C14 stereocenter (the C14 beta-hydrogen epimer of the conjugated enone cannot be isomerized to give61). To introduce the last hydroxyl group at C14, the C14-C15 olefin was subjected to Mukaiyama hydration. NoneOnce again, solvent optimization leading to the use of dioxane was necessary in order to achieve a satisfactory diastereomeric ratio of hydration products. With the completion of this step, we arrived at the protected form of the ketonic core of our target molecule (62, termed "ouabageninone"), and to date, more than 500 mg of this compound has been prepared. In addition, as a testament to the versatility of this route for further diversification, we demonstrated that61could undergo radical fluorinationNoneto produce63(Scheme8). In light of recent advances in radical functionalization of alkenes,Nonecompound61could be viewed as a viable platform for further generation of new steroidal skeletons, and ultimately, novel analogues of the cardenolides and bufadienolides. Reagents and conditions: (a) PPTS (0.2 equiv), CaSO4(2.5 equiv), Me2CO, 23 degrees C, 20 h; (b) LiBEt3H (1 M in THF, 1.1 equiv), -78 degrees C, 30 min, 92%; (c) Li (60 equiv), NH3, THF, -78 degrees C, 30 min; (d) PPTS (1.5 equiv), Me2CO, 70 degrees C, 16 h, 69% over 2 steps; (e) TMSOTf (3 equiv), Et3N (4 equiv), CH2Cl2, 0 to 23 degrees C, 30 min; Pd(OAc)2(1.2 equiv), MeCN, 23 degrees C, 3 h, then FeCl3(1 equiv), 0 degrees C, 10 min; (f) SiO2,iPr2EtN (55 equiv), C6F5CF3, 23 degrees C, 45 min, 55% over 2 steps; (g) Co(acac)2(0.2 equiv), PhSiH3(3 equiv), O2(1 atm), dioxane, 23 degrees C, 3 h, 86%. Reagents and conditions: Fe2(oxalate)3(4 equiv), NaBH4(6.4 equiv), Selectfluor (4 equiv), 3:4:2 MeCN:THF:H2O, 0 degrees C, 20 min, 51%. With a scalable route to ouabageninone secured, attention was then turned to introduction of the butenolide moiety with the correct stereochemical orientation. To this end, a model study employing estrone as starting material was conducted (Scheme9). Using a similar route to Scheme7, the tertiary hydroxyl group at C14 was introduced to afford64(see theSupporting Informationfor its preparation). It was initially envisioned that the butenolide moiety would be appended via a palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling, followed by a chemo- and diastereoselective reduction of the C16-C17 olefin. Thus, ketone64was first converted to the corresponding vinyl iodide using Barton's protocol. NoneA wide range of conditions were tried for the butenolide attachment, but initial results were discouraging as the desired product68could only be obtained in very poor yield (Table2). Eventually, it was found that the use of Furstner's modified Stille coupling protocolNoneled to the formation of dienoate68in a synthetically useful yield. Reagents and conditions: (a) N2H4(10 equiv), Et3N (10 equiv), EtOH, 50 degrees C, 5 h; I2(3 equiv), Et3N (4 equiv), THF, 23 degrees C, 10 min; (b) Ra-Ni (10 wt equiv), THF, 23 degrees C, 14 h, 90%. Compound65was used without further purification from the previous step. With sufficient quantities of68in hand, chemoselective reduction of the C16-C17 olefin was attempted. No reaction was observed when palladium on carbon was used as the hydrogenation catalyst, and when the more active platinum catalyst was employed, nonselective hydrogenation of both olefins occurred. A chemoselective hydrogenation was eventually effected by using Ra-Ni,Nonebut this led to the wrong stereochemical outcome of the reduction, giving69. This result stood in stark contrast to hydrogenation conducted on steroids possessing a more conventionaltransC/D ring configuration, where reduction from the alpha face is typically observed. Clearly, thecisconfiguration of68rendered its convex face more accessible for hydrogenation. Alternatively, a directing effect of the C14 hydroxyl group could also be invoked to explain the stereochemical outcome. A radical-based couplingNoneapproach employing iodide71and lactones66,72, and73was also attempted but only deiodination of71was observed (Scheme10). Reagents and conditions: (a) O2(1 atm), N2H4, EtCO2H, EtOH, 100 degrees C, 2.5 h.Another approach was then developed based on the idea of using a butenolide anion equivalent to effect a nucleophilic addition onto the C17 carbon from the more accessible beta-face. A hydrazone-boronic acid coupling protocolNonedisclosed by Barluenga and co-workers in 2009 was viewed as a highly attractive option owing to the minimal number of concession steps to be performed either before or after the coupling, and thus, the potential brevity of the overall sequence. A C2-substituted furanboronic acid was identified as a suitable butenolide equivalent (Scheme11), and this compound was accessed by subjecting furan74to Ir-catalyzed C-H silylation employing a procedure developed by Falck and co-workers. NoneTreatment with NaIO4unmasked the free boronic acid to give76. Gratifyingly, coupling of this boronic acid and tosylhydrazone77proceeded to give78with the correct stereochemical configuration, albeit in modest yield. Conversion of the substituted furan moiety to butenolide70could be readily achieved by treatment with basic AcOOH solution. NoneReagents and conditions: (a) [Ir(OMe)(cod)]2(0.05 equiv), dtbpy (0.1 equiv), 2-norbornene (1.5 equiv), PhMe2SiH (1.5 equiv), 80 degrees C, 8 h, 43%; (b) NaIO4(3 equiv), HCl (1 M, 0.7 equiv), 4:1 THF:H2O, 23 degrees C, 2 h, 91%; (c) TsNHNH2(1.5 equiv), dioxane, 110 degrees C, 5 h, 64%; (d) K2CO3(2.2 equiv), dioxane, 110 degrees C, 5 h, ca. 20%; (e) AcOOH (32 wt % in H2O), NaOAc (5 equiv), CH2Cl2, 23 degrees C, 24 h, ca. 70%. Having identified a viable method for installation of the butenolide moiety, we turned our efforts back to the synthesis of ouabagenin (1). In the conversion of ouabageninone to the corresponding tosylhydrazone, we encountered the first hurdle: concomitant removal of all the protecting groups was observed upon conversion to the corresponding hydrazone. This problem was rectified by the use of TrisNHNH2, which allowed formation of hydrazone79at ambient temperature (Scheme12). Submitting this hydrazone to the coupling conditions with boronic acid76, however, led to formation of a complex mixture of products, none of which could be identified as the desired coupled product81a. Reagents and conditions: (a) TrisNHNH2(1.5 equiv), CH2Cl2, 23 degrees C, 10 h, 80%; (b)76(2 equiv), K2CO3(2.2 equiv), dioxane, 110 degrees C, 5 h; (c) TMSOTf (3 equiv), Et3N (4 equiv), 23 degrees C, 1 h; (d) Ac2O (3 equiv), pyridine (7 equiv), DMAP (1 equiv), DMF, 40 degrees C, 20 h, 66%; (e) MOMCl (2.4 equiv),iPr2EtN (3.5 equiv), DMAP (1 equiv), CH2Cl2, 0 to 23 degrees C, 24 h, 62%. Positing that the free hydroxyl group at C11 is incompatible with the transient diazo species, we decided to convert it to the corresponding TMS ether (80), acetate (82) and MOM ether (83). Unfortunately, subjection of these compounds to the Barluenga coupling conditions again led to formation of a complex mixture of products. Several additives, notably fluoride saltsNoneas well as different protecting groups at the C11 hydroxyl moiety were also tried, but none of these strategies led to any improvement to the outcome of the reaction. These failures led us to reinvestigate the original Stille coupling/chemoselective reduction route (Scheme13). Thus, ketone62was converted to the corresponding vinyl iodide and then subjected to the modified Stille cross-coupling conditions to deliver dienoate85. As was observed in the estrone model system, hydrogenation of85resulted in reduction from the undesired convex face of the molecule. Use of other conditions led to a nonselective reduction outcome, none of which could be identified as the desired product. We eventually discovered that the use ofin situ-generated Co2BNoneled to chemoselective formation of tetrasubstituted olefin86. Extensive screening of organic bases and superbases (Table S1,Supporting Information) again led to the formation of an epimeric mixture of enoates, where our desired product was only present in minor amounts. Gratifyingly, we discovered that heating86in the presence of Barton's base (BTMG)Noneleads to the formation of a 3:1 mixture of enoates in favor of the desired product. To complete the synthesis of ouabagenin (1), this product was treated with concentrated HCl to effect global removal of the protecting groups. Overall, the synthesis of ouabagenin (1) was achieved in 20 steps and in 0.6% yield from adrenosterone (30) or in 21 steps and in 0.5% yield from cortisone acetate (9). Reagents and conditions: (a) N2H4(10 equiv), Et3N (10 equiv), 4:1 CH2Cl2:EtOH, 50 degrees C, 5 h; I2(3 equiv), Et3N (4 equiv), THF, 10 min; (b)66(4 equiv), [Ph2PO2][NBu4] (4 equiv), Pd(PPh3)4(0.15 equiv), CuTC (3 equiv), DMF, 23 degrees C, 2 h, 42% over two steps; (c) CoCl2.6H2O (2.5 equiv), NaBH4(5 equiv), EtOH, 0 to 23 degrees C, 20 min; (d) BTMG (1.5 equiv), C6H6, 100 degrees C, 10 min, 70% over two steps; (e) conc. HCl (2 equiv), MeOH, 23 degrees C, 30 min, 90%. As an extension of this work, we applied some of the methodologies developed in this campaign to the preparation of C19-hydroxylated analogues of corticosteroid drugs. Topical glucocorticoids represent the treatment of choice for inflammatory dermal diseasesNoneand when used properly, only limited systemic adverse events are observed, which make them a safe and effective therapy. However, long-term use of topical treatment on large body surface areas can be associated with systemic side effects partly due to mineralocorticoid antagonism of the glucocorticoids, which causes fluid-electrolyte imbalance and hypertension. NoneAll therapeutically used glucocorticoids possess this undesired mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonism in addition to their glucocorticoid receptor (GR) agonism, and some SAR information on these two receptors has been reported for a range of steroids. NoneHowever, only very limited SAR knowledge is available for glucocorticoids modified at the C19 position, presumably due to the difficulty in procuring meaningful quantities of these C19-modified compounds. To investigate the pharmacological impact of installing a C19-hydroxy function in the glucocorticoid scaffold, analogue90became our initial target compound (Figure5A). Its synthesis commenced with global protection of the ketone moieties of cortisone acetate (9) to afford87. Following the procedure delineated in the synthesis of ouabagenin (1), iodide88was prepared. Deketalization and iodide hydrolysis afforded enone89in a straightforward manner. A chemoselective reduction of the C11 ketone followed by deprotection of the side chain under forcing conditions furnished the desired analogue90(for details, see theSupporting Information). To probe the overall effect of the hydroxyl moieties at the C19 and C11 positions, analogues bearing the epimeric hydroxyl group (91) and no hydroxyl group (92) at C11 were also synthesized from intermediate89(for details, see theSupporting Information). As can be seen in Figure5B, the GR binding data for92showed a total lack of activity (IC50 greater than 10 000 nM), suggesting that introduction of a hydroxyl group at C19 alone cannot compensate for loss of the critical C11 hydroxyl. However, the data for90confirm that introduction of the C19 hydroxyl while keeping the C11 hydroxyl-in the same orientation as in hydrocortisone-only results in a 10-fold loss of affinity compared to the latter. This proves that the C19 hydroxyl is generally tolerated in steroidal GR agonists. The fact that91, the C11 epimer of90, is completely inactive in the GR binding assay further underscores the critical role of the presence and orientation of the C11 hydroxyl moiety. We were then very pleased to see that the GR binding of90also translated into anti-inflammatory efficacy in a cellular assay (LPS-induced IL-12B released from primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells), albeit with low potency.

(B) GR binding and anti-inflammatory efficacy of steroid analogues and reference compounds. NoneGR, glucocorticoid receptor. NoneIL-12B, interleukin-12B; MR, mineralocorticoid receptor. NoneThe number in parentheses is the corresponding efficacy value. NoneThe abbreviation "nd" indicates that examination is not done. In light of these data and the ?1000-fold difference in cellular potency (IL-12B) between clobetasole propionate and hydrocortisone, we next elected to explore the effect of incorporating two D-ring clobetasol side chains (chloroketone and propionate ester moieties) on90. The synthesis started from intermediate89(Figure5A). A chemoselective reduction of the C11 ketone in the presence of the A-ring enone moiety initially proved to be challenging. A preliminary solution was found by first globally reducing the two ketones, followed by allylic oxidation of the C3 hydroxyl group to regenerate the enone moiety. Eventually, it was found that a modified NaBH4reduction protocol could effect a chemoselective C11 ketone reduction while leaving the A-ring enone intact to arrive at93. It was serendipitously found that a methylene transfer to the C11 and C19 diol from the side chain of93could be effected under acidic conditions to afford94, which interestingly achieved the desired protection by concomitant deprotection. With diol94in hand, a chlorine atom was introduced at the C21 position. NoneInstallation of a propionate esterNoneat C17 and deprotection with HCl then completed the synthesis of analogue97. We were encouraged to see the increase in GR binding affinity (?15-fold) and cellular potency (?30-fold) of97compared to90(Figure5B). Furthermore,97showed an interesting selectivity profile against the mineralocorticoid receptor where it exhibited neither antagonistic nor agonistic effect when tested up to 1 muM (data not shown), suggesting that the C19 position potentially could be a trigger region for obtaining selectivity for the glucocorticoid receptor over the mineralocorticoid receptor. Finally, further refinement of97by introduction of a fluorine atomNoneat C6 (to give analogue98) provided a two-fold improvement in both the GR affinity and cellular potency, which is in agreement with published SAR for compounds bearing no hydroxyl group at C19. NoneStereochemically defined functional adornment of a steroid system was accomplished by following a "redox-relay" approach. This simplifying strategy allowed for the sequential installation of four hydroxyl units that underscore the complexity of ouabagenin (1). First, solid-state photochemistry and cyclobutanol fragmentation achieved hydroxylation at the C19 position of a steroid skeleton, which is a key motif in both ouabagenin (1) and C19-hydroxylated steroid analogues of cortisone acetate (9). Then, many redox-relay events were conducted, involving directed epoxidation, diepoxide fragmentation, and a Saegusa oxidation/Mukaiyama hydration sequence. Unexpected difficulty was encountered when installing the requisite butenolide moiety in1, which was overcome by careful examination of an estrone model system. Finally, adapting the C19-hydroxylation method to related steroid systems has resulted in a series of hydroxylated analogues for structure-activity relationship studies. Evaluation of these steroid analogues for glucocorticoid receptor (GR) agonism has shown that the C19-hydroxylated steroid skeleton is a promising scaffold for identifying new anti-inflammatory drug candidates with improved properties, which will motivate our continued efforts in this field.
