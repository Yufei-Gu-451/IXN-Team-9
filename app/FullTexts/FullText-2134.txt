The growing popularity of competitive baseball among adolescents has been accompanied by a rise in the incidence of unique throwing-related injuries. NoneNotably, there has been an increase in the number of medial ulnar collateral ligament reconstruction ("Tommy John") procedures being performed on injured throwers. None,None,NoneMany factors have been cited as proximate causes for the increasing prevalence of throwing-related injuries, including overuse, high pitch counts, poor throwing mechanics, and the curveball. Many upper extremity injuries occurring in baseball may be preventable with improvements in pitching mechanics and pitch selection. None,None,NoneWhile recommendations regarding global overuse are supported by the available evidence, data regarding curveballs at a young age-a commonly accepted risk factor for injury-are unclear. A critical review to evaluate whether curveballs put pitchers at increased risk has not been performed. We hypothesized that the current evidence does not support increased injury risk from the curveball, despite widespread acceptance of this idea among baseball trainers, coaches, and physicians. A systematic review of the published English language literature assessing the impact of pitching a curveball in baseball was performed using the Ovid MEDLINE database from 1946 to March 1, 2012. The search included the termscurveballandbaseball pitching injuries. All studies with a cohort of athletes (youth through professional levels) who were followed to determine the risk of pitching a curveball were included. Studies were divided into 2 categories: biomechanical and epidemiologic. Biomechanical studies analyzed the muscle activation, kinematics, and/or kinetics of pitching a curveball in comparison to a fastball, while epidemiologic studies attempted to correlate curveball use to pain/injury. The references of all included studies were reviewed to incorporate all relevant articles. Review articles and case reports were not included. Two reviewers independently extracted relevant data from the studies. Comparisons were organized by impact on the torso, shoulder, elbow, forearm, and wrist. The data by Glousman et alNoneon muscle activity in healthy versus medial collateral ligament-insufficient pitchers were aggregated to compare results in healthy (n = 30) and injured pitchers (n = 10) separately. Only provided with sample size, mean, and standard deviations from the study, a pairedttest assuming a small correlation value (r= 0.1) was used to determine statistical significance (P less than 0.05). A total of 10 biomechanical and 6 epidemiologic studies met the inclusion criteria. Of these, that by Lyman et alNonewas excluded because the data collection period coincided with a larger studyNoneat the same institution. Five epidemiologic studies published between 2001 and 2011 were identified for inclusion: 1 case-control, 1 retrospective cohort, and 3 prospective cohort studies (Table 1). Three studies included athletes aged 8 to 14 years, and the other 2 used high school and college athletes aged 14 to 20 years. Ten biomechanical laboratory studies comparing the stresses and kinematics of the curveball to the fastball were included (Table 2). Three studies included electromyographic data; 7, kinematic measures; and 4, throwing kinetics. Youth athletes were included in 1 study, high school-aged pitchers in another, and college and/or professional athletes in the remaining 8. The dates of publication range from 1979Noneto 2009. NoneEpidemiologic studiesParentheses indicate the number and percentage that pitched a curveball. Injured, n = 95; healthy, n = 45.At beginning of study in 1999. Biomechanical studiesNoneMedial collateral ligament injury, n = 10; healthy, n = 30. All comparisons between curveball and fastball pitches were significant (P less than 0.05) unless otherwise stated. A 2001 study utilizing postgame telephone interviews with 298 youth pitchers revealed no significant association between pitching a curveball and shoulder or elbow pain (Table 3). NoneWith a similar study design in 2002, there was a 52% increase in shoulder pain in 476 pitchers when pitching a curveball. NoneIn a retrospective cohort of pitchers who underwent elbow ulnar collateral ligament reconstruction, 67% reported throwing a curveball before the age of 14 years. NoneIn a comparison of adolescent pitchers who had elbow or shoulder surgery and healthy pitchers without an arm injury, there was no significant association between the age that a pitcher began throwing a breaking ball and arm injury. NoneAdditionally, there was no association of arm injury with the number of years throwing a breaking ball before shaving (a measure of developmental maturity). A 10-year prospective study that utilized annual surveys of arm pain or injury found no relationship between throwing a curveball before 13 years of age and arm injury in the 481 youth pitchers. NoneEpidemiologic dataWhile 3 of the 5 epidemiologic studies found no significant association between pitching a curveball and elbow or shoulder pain,None,None,Noneother factors were noted that may increase risk of pain and/or injury. All 5 studies implicated an increased amount of pitching as a significant risk factor for arm pain or injury (Table 3). None,None,None,None,NoneSignificantly less maximum pelvis angular velocity was found while pitching a curveball as compared with a fastball (560-590 vs 600-640 deg/s, respectively) (Table 4). None,None,NoneLess upper trunk angular velocity with the curveball was also shown. None,None,NoneWhile 1 of the collegiate studies and the youth study found no difference in forward and lateral trunk tilt between pitches,None,NoneFleisig et al found 4 degrees greater forward and 3 degrees greater lateral trunk tilt at ball release; this is of unknown clinical significance. NoneBiomechanical dataND, study found no difference between curveballs and fastballs. Five of the 10 biomechanical studies described the kinematics of the shoulder during the delivery of a curveball and fastball. None,None,None,None,NoneTwo studies of collegiate athletes (n = 26) found no difference between the 2 pitches with respect to shoulder abduction, horizontal adduction, and external rotation. None,NoneTwo studies found greater shoulder abduction at arm accelerationNoneand ball releaseNonewhile noting greater horizontal adduction at arm cocking and ball release with the curveball. Youth pitchers also had less maximum external rotation at arm cocking when pitching a curveball versus a fastball (176.2 degrees vs 178.2 degrees , respectively). NoneHowever, the other 4 studies that included high school and collegiate pitchers did not find a difference in maximum external rotation. None,None,None,NoneNissen et al described less overall arc of motion at the glenohumeral joint (117 degrees vs 124 degrees ) and less maximum internal rotation angular velocity (3409 vs 3619 deg/s). NoneThe internal rotation velocity results were duplicated in youth but not collegiate pitchers. None,NoneOne of the 4 kinetics studies found no differences at the shoulder joint in collegiate pitchers. NoneHowever, studies of youth and high school pitchers revealed less internal rotation torque (31.9 vs 34.8 Nm and 52.0 vs 56.8 Nm, respectively). None,NoneLess proximal force at arm acceleration was also seen in youth pitchersNoneand reduced shoulder flexion moments in high school pitchers. NoneNo studies indicated increased force or torque at the glenohumeral joint when throwing a curveball compared with a fastball. Elbow kinematics in 4 studies involving collegiate pitchers (n = 6-40) show no significant differences between curveballs and fastballs (Table 5). None,None,None,NoneIn high school pitchers, less overall arc of motion was demonstrated in the curveball (81 degrees +/- 14 degrees vs 83 degrees +/- 14 degrees ). NoneDun et alNonefound greater elbow flexion at ball release and less extension velocity in youth pitchers. Elbow flexion at other phases of the throwing motion was similar for both types of pitches. Six international athletes showed increased mean elbow peak angular velocity just before release (985.5 vs 968.3 deg/s), but this study was not powered adequately for statistical analysis. NoneBiomechanical dataECRL, extensor carpi radialis longus; ECRB, extensor carpi radialis brevis; FCR, flexor carpi radialis; ND, study found no difference between curveballs and fastballs; max, maximum; ROM, range of motion. Observational statement. Pvalue not given. Electromyographic studies of pitchers' elbows examined the biceps, brachioradialis, and triceps maximum muscle activity during 4 phases of the pitching motion. Sisto et alNonefound less brachioradialis activity in the earlier phases-early cocking, late cocking, and acceleration-in curveball pitches, but statistical significance analysis was not provided. Glousman et alNonealso found less brachioradialis activity at acceleration and follow-through but no difference in the activities of the biceps or triceps. The first kinetic study in 1979 demonstrated inconsistent measures of normalized elbow forces, with 2 adult pitchers showing increased forces at the elbow and 2 others showing decreased forces when throwing a curveball. NoneSince then, less proximal elbow force at arm acceleration has been seen with the curveball (934 vs 988 Nm in collegiate pitchers and 428.2 vs 461.9 Nm in youth pitchers). NoneThese 3 studies of elbow flexion torque disagree; the 29 youth pitchers had less elbow flexion torque at arm acceleration,Nonebut the 20 collegiate athletes did not show a difference. None,NoneIn addition, 2 studies examining elbow varus torque both found reduced moments when throwing curveballs (54.1 vs 59.6 Nm in collegiate pitchers and 31.6 vs 34.8 Nm in youth pitchers). None,NoneSeven of 8 studies of forearm position in pitching found greater supination with the curveball than the fastball, with differences ranging from 7.3 degrees to 19.8 degrees particularly at arm-cocking and acceleration phases. None,None,None,None,None,None,NoneOne study noted greater forearm supination when throwing a curveball but did not quantify the differences between the pitches. NoneIn an electromyographic study, greater supinator muscle activity was found in the late cocking phase when a curveball was thrown. NoneDecreased pronator teres activation (47% vs 85% maximum muscle strength test at acceleration) has also been shown. NoneCollegiate pitchers did not demonstrate a difference in forearm pronation torque. NoneHowever, in youth pitchers, increased forearm supination torque at arm acceleration was recorded when pitchers threw a curveball compared with a fastball (1.2 +/- 0.9 vs 0.9 +/- 0.7 Nm). NoneElliott et al was the first to report greater wrist flexion, ulnar deviation, and angular velocity when releasing a curveball, which allows the pitcher to command the appropriate spin necessary for the ball to curve. NoneFive other studies show less wrist extension, ranging from 6 degrees to 13 degrees , when the arm is cocking, but the ulnar deviation was not significant in 4 of them. None,None,None,None,NoneNissen et alNonefound slightly greater ulnar deviation of the wrist at ball release and maximum internal rotation. The wrist demonstrated greater curveball radioulnar range of motion (17 degrees vs 14 degrees ) and greater ulnar angular velocity (360 vs 154 deg/s) at ball release with the curveball than the fastball. NoneElectromyographic data are inconsistent, as Sisto et alNonefound greater wrist extension associated with the curveball since the extensor carpi radialis longus and extensor carpi radialis brevis had greater activity in the late cocking, acceleration, and follow-through of the curveball than with the fastball. While other researchers found decreased flexor carpi radialis muscle activation at late cocking and acceleration, they also found decreased extensor carpi radialis longus and extensor carpi radialis brevis activity at acceleration. NoneMixed results are also found with wrist kinetics. Fleisig et alNonefound no difference in the forces and torques about the wrist in collegiate pitchers. Nissen et alNonesaw reduced maximum flexion moments (7.8 vs 8.3 Nm) but greater wrist ulnar moments (4.9 vs 3.2 Nm). NoneContradicting this were youth pitchers who demonstrated greater wrist flexion torques at arm acceleration (2.3 vs 1.5 Nm). NoneOveruse has been implicated as a risk factor for upper extremity injuries in baseball pitchers, prompting Little League Baseball to institute maximum pitch counts. NoneMost youth and high school leagues have similar restrictions, usually limiting the number of innings pitched. None,NoneWhile there are currently no rules in baseball restricting the use of the curveball, many suggest that it is a potential risk factor for injury. USA Baseball recommends that breaking pitches (curveballs, sliders, etc) not be thrown until after bone maturity. NoneThese recommendations are primarily based on baseball expert opinion. NoneOne of the studies cited in support of current curveball guidelines is confounded by pitch counts, which increases the odds of arm pain in a game and season. NoneYouth pitchers with the highest pitch counts are likely the better pitchers on the team and therefore more inclined to throw a curveball earlier in their careers, further emphasizing overuse as a confounding variable. Additionally, a prior study using identical methods found no difference in the incidence of arm pain. NoneA retrospective review of pitchers who underwent ulnar collateral ligament reconstruction supporting USA Baseball's recommendation did not compare with a healthy age-matched control group to determine statistical significance. NoneA more recent study attempted to mitigate the lack of a study control group by comparing injured with uninjured pitchers and found no correlation of injury with the age at which the curveball was first thrown. NoneAs such, the epidemiologic evidence to support limitations on the curveball is lacking rigor in study design. Two studies found that throwing a changeup pitch reduced the incidence of elbow and/or shoulder pain. None,NoneConsistent kinematic differences were increased horizontal adduction of the shoulder, increased forearm supination, and decreased wrist extension. Kinetics were not increased at the shoulder or elbow. None,None,None,None,NoneTwo studies found less proximal force and less varus torque at the elbow, with no data suggesting greater kinetic forces. None,None,NoneYouth pitchers, the population of greatest concern, were the subjects in 1 of these studies. NoneIn addition, 2 studies on kinetics found decreased proximal forces and internal rotation torques at the shoulder,None,Nonehighlighting the disconnect between biomechanical and epidemiologic studies. Whether these differences are due to pitchers' discomfort with the grip, decreased arm speed for a slower pitch, or the minor mechanical differences required to produce the ball spin for a curveball, it does not appear that the curveball places additional strain on an athlete's arm. The current biomechanical evidence does not support limiting the use of curveballs at any level of baseball. While the curveball does not appear to put additional biomechanical strain on a pitcher's arm, electromyographic and kinematic studies consistently found that the curveball requires greater supination of the forearm. None,None,None,None,None,None,None,NoneThis is consistent with the widespread technique of imparting spin onto the curveball with a strong "over the top" wrist supination snap. In addition to strengthening the rotator cuff muscles, the forearm muscles should be trained for the curveball. None,NoneWe support USA Baseball's recommendation to teach proper mechanics and use of the changeup to prevent arm injuries. NoneDespite much debate in the baseball community about the safety of the curveball, biomechanical and most epidemiologic studies do not demonstrate an increased risk of pain and/or injury when compared with the fastball. Current recommendations to discourage throwing curveballs at a young age, while well intentioned, are based on observational data and expert opinion that have not been validated by biomechanical studies. However, there is limited biomechanical and electromyographic evidence suggesting that youth pitchers throwing curveballs may benefit from conditioning programs focused on forearm supination.
