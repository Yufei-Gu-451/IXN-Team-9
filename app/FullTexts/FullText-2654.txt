Thetrans-(3R,4R)-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine scaffold is a known opioid antagonist pharmacophore for the mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptors (MOP, KOP, and DOP, respectively),Noneand is present in several opioid antagonists such as the nonselective opioid antagonist LY255582,Nonethe peripherally restricted mu opioid antagonist LY246736 (Alvimopan; ENTEREG),Noneand the kappa opioid antagonist JDTicNone(Figure1). However, this universal opioid antagonist pharmacophore has not been explored for antagonists at the fourth opioid subtype, nociceptin opioid receptor (NOP). Although opioid peptides and classical morphinan-based opioid ligands do not have appreciable affinity for NOP, phenylpiperidine-type scaffolds are found among both opioid (e.g., fentanyl, lofentanil) as well as NOP ligands (e.g., SB-612111) (Figure1). As part of our continuing investigation into novel NOP ligands, we examined the affinity of the kappa opioid antagonist JDTic at the NOP receptor, and found it to have surprisingly high affinity at NOP, with aKiof 16.7 +/- 0.76 nM and no intrinsic activity in the [35S]GTPgammaS functional assay, in agreement with a recent report by Munro and colleaguesNone(Table1). Since this was the firsttrans-(3R,4R)-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine-containing ligand to show good binding affinity at the NOP receptor, we explored the structural determinants of JDTic's NOP binding affinity and functional activity, with rational chemical modifications designed to inform the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of the various functionalities of this new 'antagonist' molecule at the NOP receptor. The chemical modifications explored are shown in Figure2. Structures oftrans-(3R,4R)-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine-containing opioid antagonists and phenylpiperidine-containing opioid and nociceptin receptor ligands. (a) From ref (6). (b) From ref (7). Most high affinity NOP ligands possess a central piperidine scaffold, and generally contain two other pharmacophoric groups, namely, substituents on the piperidine nitrogen and at the 4-piperidine position, as represented in our previously proposed NOP ligand 2D pharmacophore model. NoneTypically, the N-substituents on the piperidine nitrogen tend to be aromatic or lipophilic alicyclic groups such as those found in the NOP antagonist J-113397Noneor SB-612111. NoneWe therefore examined the importance of the 2-methylpropyl-7-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-3-isoquinolinecarboxamide N-substituent of JDTic, for its NOP activity by replacing it with lipophilic substituents such as those found in other NOP ligands, namely, the 4-isopropylcyclohexyl and the cyclooctyl groups as in compounds1-3(Figure2, Table1). The valine-amide moiety at the piperidine nitrogen of JDTic was also removed, retaining the 7-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-3-isoquinolinecarboxamide as in compounds4and5(Figure2, Table1). Structural exploration of JDTic for SAR of the binding affinity and functional activity at the NOP receptor. Target compound numbers are indicated in parentheses in the figure. The importance of the 3,4-dimethyl substituents of the 'opioid antagonist' pharmacophore in JDTic to its NOP and opioid binding affinity was also investigated with compound6(AT-076) (Figure2, Table1), which lacks both the 3- and 4-methyl groups. Although thetrans-3,4-dimethyl groups have long been considered important for the opioid 'antagonist' profile of compounds containing this pharmacophore,None,NoneKormos et al. Nonerecently showed that removing the 3- or 4-methyl groups or both, retained opioid antagonist activity in a series ofN-methyl andN-phenylpropyl piperidine opioids, albeit with reduced potency and no selectivity. The phenolic 7-hydroxy group on the tetrahydroisoquinoline moiety was shown to be an important address group for kappa affinity and antagonist activity of JDTic. NoneWe investigated the importance of both phenolic hydroxy groups on JDTic, namely, the 7-hydroxyl and the 3-hydroxyl groups, to the binding affinity and opioid selectivity, with compounds7and compound8, respectively. Compounds1and2(Scheme1) were prepared from (3R,4R)-3,4-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidineI-1and 4-isopropylcyclohexanone, using standard reductive amination conditions. Alternatively, a stepwise sequence using Ti(OiPr)4followed by NaBH(OAc)3was employed for cyclooctyl analogue3(Scheme1),Noneas standard reductive amination conditions did not afford the desired material in sufficient yield. Reagents and conditions: (a) for1and2: 4-isopropylcyclohexanone, HOAc, NaBH(OAc)3, DCE, rt, 24 h, 20-50%; for3: (i) cyclooctanone, Ti(OiPr)4, THF, 40 degrees C, 21 h; (ii) NaBH(OAc)3, 40 degrees C, 1 h, 71%. Compounds4and5lacking the valine-amide moiety were synthesized as shown in Scheme2. HATU-mediated coupling of piperidineI-1and (3R)-2-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-7-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acidII-1or (3R)-2-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acidII-2afforded amidesII-3andII-4, respectively. Removal of the Boc group with trifluoroacetic acid followed by reduction of the amide with borane dimethyl sulfide complex gave the compounds4and5in moderate yields. Reagents and conditions: (a) forII-3: HATU, Et3N, MeCN, rt, 21 h, 49%; forII-4: (i) HATU, Et3N, MeCN, rt, 22 h; (ii) LiOH, MeOH, rt, 5 h, 94%; (b) TFA, CH2Cl2, rt, 1.5-2 h, 82-89%; (c) BH3.SMe2, THF(ah), reflux, 5 h, 36-56%. Des-3R,4R-dimethyl analogue6(AT-076) was prepared using a similar synthesis strategy as that used for JDTicNone,None(Scheme3). BOP-assisted amidation of 4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidineIII-1with Boc-l-valine yielded amideIII-2. Boc deprotection and borane reduction gave amineIII-3. Subsequent BOP-mediated coupling of amineIII-3with carboxylic acidII-1gave the corresponding amideIII-4, and Boc-deprotection with trifluoroacetic acid afforded6in good yields. Reagents and conditions: (a) Boc-l-valine, BOP, Et3N, THF, rt, 2 h, 97%; (b) TFA, CH2Cl2, rt, 1 h, 91%; (c) BH3.SMe2, THF(ah), reflux, 4 h, 71%; (d)II-1(forIII-4) orII-2(forIII-5), BOP, Et3N, THF, rt, 3-4 h, 67-93%; (e) TFA, CH2Cl2, rt, 1.5-2 h, 56-57%. Des-hydroxyl analogues7and8(Schemes3and4) were synthesized using the same strategy as that used for compound6(AT-076). Compound7, lacking the 7-hydroxyl group of the Tic moiety (Scheme3), was prepared from common intermediateIII-3by BOP-coupling with carboxylic acidII-2, followed by trifluoroacetic acid deprotection of the Boc group. Compound8, lacking the 3-hydroxyl group on the phenylpiperidine (Scheme4), was prepared by BOP-coupling of 4-phenylpiperidineIV-1and Boc-l-valine to give amideIV-2, followed by trifluoroacetic acid deprotection and subsequent borane reduction to give amineIV-3. BOP-assisted coupling of amineIV-3with carboxylic acidII-1afforded amideIV-4, followed by deprotection with hydrochloric acid to give8.

The binding affinities of1-8for the opioid receptors were determined by radioligand competition experiments, using [3H]N/OFQ for the NOP receptor, [3H]U69,593 for KOP, [3H]DAMGO for MOP, and [3H]Cl-DPDPE for the DOP receptor, as radioligands (Table1) in receptor-transfected CHO cells, as we have reported previouslyNoneand described in detail. NoneThe intrinsic activity of the compounds alone was determined by their ability to stimulate [35S]GTPgammaS binding to cell membranes and compared to the standard agonists N/OFQ (NOP), DAMGO (MOP), U69,593 (KOP), and DPDPE (DOP) (Table1), as reported previously. None,None,NoneThe functional antagonism of the compounds was determined by the ability of the compounds to inhibit agonist-stimulated [35S]GTPgammaS binding in a dose-dependent fashion. Agonist concentration-response curves were run in the presence of a series of single concentrations of the test compound. The nature of the antagonism at each of the opioid receptors was determined by Schild regression analysis of the data. In the case where the antagonist induced parallel shifts of the agonist concentration-response curves without suppressing the maximum agonist response, the antagonist potency was calculated as theKe(nM), using the formulaNonewhere [L] is the antagonist (test compound) concentration and DR is the dose ratio of the agonist EC50in the presence and absence of the antagonist. NoneIn cases where the test compound caused nonparallel shifts of the agonist concentration-response curves and decreased the maximum agonist response, the experiments were carried out with at least five to eight different test compound concentrations to determine the nature of antagonism, according to the principles of insurmountable antagonism described by Kenakin et al. NoneThe antagonist potency was calculated as theKe, based on the nature of the concentration-response curves. The compounds were first tested for their binding affinity at the four opioid receptors. JDTic and the NOP antagonist SB-612111Nonewere also tested for comparison. Consistent with previous reports, JDTic showed a potent nanomolar binding affinityKiof 0.43 and 1.53 nM at KOP and MOP, respectively, and slightly lower, but still potent binding affinity of 10.6 and 16.7 nM at DOP and NOP, respectively (Table1). None,NoneCompounds that showed a binding affinityKi less than 100 nM were then tested for their intrinsic activity alone in the [35S]GTPgammaS binding assay at a range of concentrations up to the highest concentration of 10 muM. As expected, JDTic had no intrinsic activity at any of the opioid receptors. The relatively potent binding affinity of JDTic at the NOP receptor was quite surprising, given that JDTic is an atypical ligand for NOP, compared to the usual piperidine-based NOP ligands (Figure1). NoneExploration of the molecular features of JDTic revealed some interesting SAR. Replacing the tetrahydroisoquinoline (Tic-OH) and valine-amide N-substituent of JDTic with lipophilic alicyclic groups typically found in NOP ligands, such as the 4-isopropylcyclohexyl (1,2) and cyclooctyl (3), completely abolished NOP binding affinity and significantly suppressed affinities at MOP, DOP, and KOP. It is interesting to note that thetrans-4-isopropylcyclohexyl-containing compound2(but not theciscompound1) has reasonably potent affinity at MOP (Ki= 6 nM), but not at any other opioid receptor. The complete lack of binding affinity of1-3at NOP suggests that thetrans-3R,4R-dimethylpiperidine-containing ligands are not able to bind to the NOP binding pocket in a manner similar to other piperidine-based NOP ligands not containing the 3R,4R-dimethyl groups (compare with SB-612111 and SR16430, Figure1). Even with the 7-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (Tic-OH) reintroduced at the N-substituent, albeit without the 2-isopropylethylamide linkage (as in4), the compound showed no affinity at NOP and a significant loss of affinity at the other opioid receptors (Table1). Interestingly, however, the compound without the 7-hydroxy group on the Tic moiety (5) showed a significant increase in binding affinity at all four opioid receptors, particularly at MOP, where it has a potent 1 nM binding affinity. The dramatic increase in NOP affinity with this simple chemical change compared with that of compound4suggests that thetrans-3R,4R-dimethylpiperidine scaffold (present in1-5and in JDTic) must have a specific fit and interactions in the NOP binding pocket, making compounds containing this scaffold very sensitive to structure modifications affecting their NOP binding affinity. Compound5, however, has no intrinsic activity at any of the opioid receptors (Table2), suggesting that5may be a reasonably selective MOP antagonist. Kivalues were determined by competitive displacement of the respective radioligands: [3H]N/OFQ-NOP, [3H]U69,593-KOP, [3H]DAMGO-MOP, and [3H]Cl-DPDPE-DOP receptor. TheKiwas calculated from the IC50values determined from the binding curves, using the Cheng-Prusoff equation. Values are the mean +/- SEM of three independent experiments run in triplicate. The effect of thetrans-3R,4R-dimethyl groups on the piperidine was even more evident from the SAR of compound6(AT-076). Removal of thetrans-3R,4R-dimethyl groups, leaving the rest of the JDTic molecule intact, resulted in compound6(AT-076) which showed a significant (?10-fold) increase in NOP binding affinity (Ki1.75 nM) compared with JDTic itself, equipotent affinity at MOP and KOP compared with JDTic, and only a slight decrease in affinity at DOP (Table1). Overall, compound6(AT-076) has potent nanomolar binding affinity at all four opioid receptors, comparable to JDTic at KOP, MOP, and DOP, and 10-fold higher affinity at NOP. Compound6(AT-076) shows no intrinsic (agonist) activity at any of the opioid receptors in the [35S]GTPgammaS functional assay (Table2). The potent binding affinity and lack of agonist activity of6(AT-076) compared to JDTic indicates that thetrans-3R,4R-dimethyl groups on the piperidine in JDTic are not indispensable for its antagonist activity, as previously thought. Although thetrans-3R,4R-dimethylpiperidine has been long considered an opioid "antagonist" pharmacophore,None,Noneremoval of the 3- or 4-methyl groups, or both, has been shown to afford opioid antagonists (Kormos et al. Noneand this work). For the NOP receptor, the SAR of compounds1-6compared to JDTic suggests that thetrans-3R,4R-dimethyl groups likely lead to a specific but not optimum binding fit at the NOP receptor, and removal of these groups results in a 10-fold improvement in binding affinity at NOP, without negatively affecting the affinity at the other opioid receptors, making compound6(AT-076) a potent, nanomolar affinity ligand at all four opioid receptors. ND = Compounds with binding affinityKi greater than 100 nM were not tested in functional assays. Interestingly, removal of the 7-hydroxyl group of the Tic moiety of compound6(AT-076), as in7, resulted in a significant drop (20-70-fold) in binding affinity at all opioid receptors, unlike the effect of this same structural change in compound4(to compound5), which increased its binding affinity significantly, particularly at NOP (compare4and5,Table1). Removal of the 3-hydroxyl group on the phenylpiperidine of compound6(AT-076), on the other hand, showed only a small drop in binding affinity (compound8, Table1), but resulted in an interesting increase in intrinsic (agonist) activity at the NOP and KOP receptors (Table2). This appears to suggest that the phenolic 3-OH group on the phenylpiperidine in6(AT-076) and in JDTic may participate in binding interactions in NOP and KOP that stabilize the receptors in an inactive conformation. JDTic, bound in the KOP crystal structure 4DJH, does not show direct hydrogen-bond interactions of the 3-phenolic hydroxy group with the receptor, but does show a structured water molecule-mediated polar interaction with C210 and W124. NoneWe carried out molecular docking of JDTic and AT-076 into the NOP crystal structure 4EA3 (bound to the NOP antagonist ligand C-24None) using Surflex Dock (Tripos SYBYL X1.2) and compared it to the docked pose of JDTic in the KOP crystal structure 4DJH (Figure3). Unlike its V-shaped bound orientation in the KOP crystal structure, JDTic binds to NOP in an extended conformation, similar to the binding orientation of the NOP antagonist C-24 (Figure3A). The 3-OH-containing phenylpiperidine moiety is buried deep inside the binding pocket of NOP, where the piperidine nitrogen makes the classic ionic interaction with the conserved Asp130 of TM3. Another distinctive difference between JDTic's binding to NOP versus its interaction with KOP is that, in the NOP receptor, only the piperidine nitrogen of JDTic (but not the isoquinoline nitrogen) makes an ionic interaction with the conserved Asp1303.32(superscript denotes Ballesteros-Weinstein numbering) (Figure3A), whereas in KOP both the piperidine nitrogen as well as the isoquinoline Tic-nitrogen interact in a bidentate ionic interaction with the conserved Asp1383.32(Figure3C). This lack of an additional ionic interaction in NOP may contribute to JDTic's 10-fold lower binding affinity compared to that at KOP. The 3,4-desmethyl JDTic analogue6(AT-076) was also docked into NOP (Figure3B) and found to bind in an extended orientation similar to and superimposable with JDTic. On the other hand, at the KOP receptor, the top-scoring AT-076 docking pose showed that while it binds in a V-shaped orientation similar to JDTic's bound conformation in KOP, the phenylpiperidine and isoquinoline rings of AT-076 are oriented opposite to those of JDTic (Figure3C). The protonated nitrogens of the phenylpiperidine and isoquinoline groups of AT-076 still appear to interact with the Asp138 in KOP, as seen with JDTic. (A) Binding model of JDTic in the NOP receptor crystal structure 4EA3. The TM helices are color-coded and annotated. The NOP antagonist C-24 bound in the NOP crystal structure is shown in cyan, whereas JDTic is in magenta. Key interacting amino acids are as indicated. (B) Binding orientation of opioid pan antagonist AT-076 in the NOP crystal structure. AT-076 (green) is superimposed on JDTic (magenta) in the NOP binding pocket. Both ligands bind in an extended conformation in the NOP receptor. (C) Binding model of AT-076 in the KOP receptor crystal structure 4DJH. AT-076 (green) is superimposed on the bound orientation of JDTic (magenta) in the KOP crystal structure. Note that AT-076 binds KOP in a similar V-shaped orientation as JDTic, but with the phenylpiperidine and isoquinoline moieties oriented exactly opposite to those of JDTic. Since6(AT-076) had potent binding affinity at all four opioid receptors and no intrinsic activity, its antagonist potency and nature of antagonism were determined from the inhibition of agonist-stimulated [35S]GTPgammaS binding curves (Figure4) in the presence of different concentrations of AT-076, using Schild analysis. At MOP and DOP, AT-076 caused a significant rightward shift of the concentration-response curve of agonist DAMGO and DPDPE, respectively, without reducingEmax, indicating competitive antagonism (Figures4A and B). The antagonist potency, calculated as theKevalue (similar to what is reported for JDTic and analogues) was 0.58 +/- 0.28 and 24.95 +/- 13 nM for MOP and DOP, respectively. Note that theKevalues for potency at MOP and DOP are comparable to their binding affinityKi(1.67 nM for MOP and 19.6 nM for DOP). Concentration-response curves of agonist-stimulated [35S]GTPgammaS binding in the presence of indicated concentrations of AT-076 at the mu (A), delta (B), kappa (C), and nociceptin (D) opioid receptors and JDTic at the NOP receptor (E). The respective agonists used were as follows: nociceptin, GGFTGARKSARKLANQ for NOP; U69,593, (5a,7a,8b)-(-)-N-methyl-N-[7-(1-pyrrolidinyl)-1-oxaspiro[4,5]dec-8-yl]benzeneacetamide for KOP; DAMGO, [d-Ala2, NMe-Phe4, Gly-ol5]-enkephalin for MOP; DPDPE, [d-Pen2,d-Pen5]enkephalin for DOP. For calculation of theKevalues, the experimentally determined EC50values of the subtype-specific agonists are as follows: nociceptin, 2.76 nM; U69,593, 26.87 nM; DAMGO, 19.78 nM; DPDPE, 4.65 nM. At KOP and NOP, however, AT-076 at increasing concentrations not only caused a decrease in agonist EC50, but also a reduction inEmaxof the agonist-response curve, producing an insurmountable antagonism of the agonist response (Figure4C and D). Similarly, JDTic at the NOP receptor also caused a reduction in theEmaxof the agonist (nociceptin) concentration-response curve and a rightward shift of the agonist EC50at increasing concentrations. The reduction in maximum agonist response at increasing antagonist concentrations is suggestive of a noncompetitive antagonist mechanism. As put forth by Kenakin et al.,Nonesuch insurmountable antagonism is suggested to result either from a slow offset orthosteric antagonist or due to allosteric modulation of the receptor. NoneGiven that AT-076 has potent nanomolar binding affinity at both NOP and KOP in radioligand displacement assays using orthosteric agonists, it appears that the former is likely the case, rather than allosteric modulation. As described by Kenakin et al,Nonein such cases, the antagonist potency can be determined from these experiments as an apparentKevalue. Using these principles, the antagonist potency for AT-076 at KOP was calculated asKe= 4.30 nM, and at NOP asKe= 30 nM. The antagonistKevalue for JDTic at the NOP receptor was calculated to be 680 nM. This weaker antagonist potency of JDTic at NOP, compared with the high binding affinityKi= 16.7 nM, suggests noncompetitive antagonism and is similar to the results observed by Munro et al. Nonefor JDTic in the cAMP functional assay at NOP. Although the antagonist potency of AT-076 at NOP and KOP appeared to be lower than that suggested by its potent binding affinityKiof 1.75 and 1.14 nM, respectively, AT-076 suppresses maximum agonist response even at the lowest concentration tested (2 nM, Figure4C and D), indicating that it is a potent antagonist at these receptors. Regardless of the precise molecular mechanism of antagonism, which would require further detailed experimental analysis, AT-076 is a high-affinity pan antagonist at all four opioid receptors. The SAR revealed in this study show that the 3,4-dimethyl groups on the classic opioid antagonist pharmacophore in JDTic are dispensable, while still maintaining the 'antagonist' activity at the opioid receptors, but likely contribute to the unusual antagonist profile and pseudoirreversible nature of JDTic's antagonist activity at the KOP receptor. None,NoneIn conclusion, simple SAR studies on JDTic's affinity for the NOP receptor resulted in compound6(AT-076), which has higher binding affinity than JDTic at NOP and equally high affinity at the other three opioid receptors, resulting in an opioid ligand which binds well to all the four opioid receptors. It is well-known that even though the NOP receptor belongs in the opioid receptor family and shares a high degree of homology with the other opioid receptors, it has low or no affinity for known opioid ligands. NoneSite-directed mutagenesis studiesNoneand the recent opioid receptor crystal structuresNone,None,Nonesuggest residues in the NOP binding pocket that exclude the binding of opioid ligands to the NOP receptor. A pan opioid ligand like AT-076, which binds with high nanomolar affinity to all four opioid receptors, would therefore be a useful tool to investigate a common opioid-binding pharmacophore, through future crystal structure determinations with all four opioid receptors. Our own molecular docking analysis with AT-076 showed that it bound to the kappa opioid receptor in an orientation exactly opposite that of the kappa-selective ligand JDTic, while still binding to the same kappa binding pocket (Figure3C). Structure-based studies of such pan opioid ligands at the four opioid receptors may likely lead to useful insights for the rational design of selective or designed multifunctional opioid ligands based on this common opioid pharmacophore. For calculation of theKevalues, the experimentally determined EC50values of the subtype-specific agonists are as follows: nociceptin, 2.76 nM; U69,593, 26.87 nM; DAMGO, 19.78 nM; DPDPE, 4.65 nM. Agonist used is nociceptin for NOP. Agonist used is U69,593, (5a,7a,8b)-(-)-N-methyl-N-[7-(1-pyrrolidinyl)-1-oxaspiro[4,5]dec-8-yl]benzeneacetamide, for KOP. Agonist used is DAMGO, [d-Ala2, NMe-Phe4, Gly-ol5]-enkephalin, for MOP. Agonist used is DPDPE, [d-Pen2,d-Pen5]enkephalin, for DOP. Data taken from ref (4b).

The cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum, in the presence of 0.4 mg/mL G418 and 0.1% penicillin/streptomycin, in 100 mm plastic culture dishes. For binding assays, the cells were scraped off the plate at confluence. For determination of inhibition of cAMP accumulation, cells were subcultured onto 24-well plates and used at confluence. Binding to cell membranes was conducted in a 96-well format, as described previously. NoneCells were removed from the plates by scraping with a rubber policeman, homogenized in Tris buffer using a Polytron homogenizer, then centrifuged once, and washed by an additional centrifugation at 27 000gfor 15 min. The pellet was resuspended in 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, and the suspension incubated with [3H]nociceptin, [3H]DAMGO, [3H]DPDPE, or [3H]U69593, for binding to NOP, mu-, delta-, or kappa-opioid receptors, respectively. The total volume of incubation was 1.0 mL, and samples were incubated for 60-120 min at 25 degrees C. The amount of protein in the binding reaction varied from approximately 15 to 30 mug. The reaction was terminated by filtration using a Tomtec 96 harvester (Orange, CT) with glass fiber filters. Bound radioactivity was counted on a Pharmacia Biotech beta-plate liquid scintillation counter (Piscataway, NJ) and expressed in counts per minute. IC50values were determined using at least six concentrations of test compound, and calculated using Graphpad/Prism (ISI, San Diego, CA). Kivalues were determined by the method of Cheng and Prusoff. None[35S]GTPgammaS binding was conducted basically as described by Traynor and Nahorski. NoneCells were scraped from tissue culture dishes into 20 mM HEPES, 1 mM EDTA and then centrifuged at 500gfor 10 min. Cells were resuspended in this buffer and homogenized using a Polytron homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 27 000gfor 15 min, and the pellet resuspended in Buffer A, containing 20 mM HEPES, 10 mM MgCl2, 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.4. The suspension was recentrifuged at 27 000gand suspended once more in Buffer A. The pellet was sometimes frozen at -70 degrees C prior to use. For the binding assay, membranes (8-15 mug protein) were incubated with [35S]GTPgammaS (50 pM), GDP (10 muM), and the appropriate compound, in a total volume of 1.0 mL, for 60 min at 25 degrees C. Samples were filtered over glass fiber filters and counted as described for the binding assays. Statistical analysis was conducted using the program Prism.
