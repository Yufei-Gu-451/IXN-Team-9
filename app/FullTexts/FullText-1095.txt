The critical contribution of deficient insulin secretion to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes is beyond doubt (1-3). The normal beta-cell response to excess nutrient and obesity-associated insulin resistance is hypersecretion of insulin that maintains blood glucose levels within the normal range. This is associated with both expansion of beta-cell mass and enhanced beta-cell function such that the amount of insulin secreted per given unit of beta-cell mass is increased (2,3). Normoglycemia can be maintained for decades in obese subjects with robust beta-cells that cope with this increased demand and sustain the compensatory response. Mechanisms for beta-cell compensation have been proposed (2,3), but there has been little exploratory investigation. Type 2 diabetes only develops in subjects unable to sustain the beta-cell compensatory response. This is associated with a progressive deterioration of beta-cell function, particularly impairment of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), and a loss of beta-cell mass through an increased rate of apoptosis (1-5). Thus, type 2 diabetes arises in subjects with islets that are susceptible to dysfunction and apoptosis under stressful conditions. The current knowledge of the molecular differences between robust and susceptible beta-cells is poor. Thedb/dbandob/obmouse models of obesity have been cornerstones in research of the mechanisms of insulin resistance and beta-cell failure (6,7). In these models, the absence of leptin signaling results in similar hyperphagia, obesity, hyperlipidemia, and insulin resistance. However, opposing predisposition to diabetes development is displayed by these mice when bred on the C57BL/6J or C57BL/KsJ background. Theob/obmouse on the C57BL/6J background strain exhibits resistance to diabetes because of successful beta-cell compensation, whereas thedb/dbmouse on the C57BL/KsJ background strain displays time-dependent progression to overt diabetes because of the failure of beta-cell compensation. The differences in beta-cell phenotype (propensity to compensation or failure) are revealed only in the setting of obesity and insulin resistance. We have used these mouse models of obesity with opposing disposition to development of diabetes to study the mechanisms of beta-cell compensation (diabetes-resistantob/obmice) and failure (diabetes-pronedb/dbmice). Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has been proposed as a mechanism for beta-cell dysfunction and death in type 2 diabetes (8-11). ER stress activates a signaling cascade known as the unfolded protein response (UPR), which has roles alleviating the ER stress through the upregulation of ER chaperones and folding enzymes and, paradoxically, activating apoptosis via deleterious UPR signaling if the stress is too severe or prolonged. We found, unexpectedly, that the presence of ER stress in islets was not unique to the model of beta-cell failure. Rather, ER stress was indicated in islets of both diabetes-resistantob/oband diabetes-pronedb/dbmice. However, the models differed in the pattern of the ER stress response, whereas the adaptive UPR was progressively upregulated with beta-cell compensation, it declined with beta-cell failure. We also tested the influence of improving the chaperone activity of the ER on the gene expression changes that were found exclusively in islets of diabetes-pronedb/dbmice, namely the upregulation of inflammation and oxidative stress gene expression and the progressive loss of beta-cell differentiation. C57BL/KsJdb/dband C57BL/6Job/obmice and their age-matched lean control mice (C57BL/KsJ or C57BL/6J, respectively) were taken from the Garvan Institute breeding colonies. Animals were kept under conventional conditions with free access to food and water. All procedures were approved by the Garvan Institute/St. Vincent's Hospital Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee and followed guidelines issued by the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia. To assess the time course changes in islet gene expression, mice were studied at 6 and 16 weeks of age. Blood samples were taken via tail prick for measurement of glucose levels. Blood collected in EDTA via a terminal heart bleed was used for measurement of plasma insulin, triglyceride, and nonesterified fatty acid levels. Mice were anesthetized and their islets were isolated with liberase RI (Roche) digestion of the pancreas. Islets were further separated with a Ficoll-Paque PLUS gradient (Amersham Biosciences) and handpicked under a stereomicroscope. Immediately after collection, islets were used for extraction of RNA. Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests (2 g/kg glucose) were performed in conscious mice after 6 h of fasting. Blood glucose was measured using an Accu-Chek Performa glucose monitor (Roche Diagnostics, Castle Hill, Australia). Plasma insulin was measured using ELISA (Crystal Chem, Downers Grove, IL). Plasma triglyceride was measured using an enzymatic colorimetric method (GPO-PAP reagent; Roche Diagnostics). Plasma nonesterified fatty acid was measured by an acyl-CoA oxidase-based colorimetric method (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan). Isolated islets were washed in Krebs-Ringer HEPES buffer (containing 5 mmol/L NaHCO3, 1 mmol/L CaCl2, 2.8 mmol/L glucose, 10 mmol/L HEPES, and 0.1% BSA). Groups of five islets, with three to four replicates per animal, were incubated for 1 h at 37 degrees C in Krebs-Ringer HEPES buffer containing 2.8 or 16.7 mmol/L glucose. Insulin was measured in an aliquot of the buffer by radioimmunoassay (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Isolated islets from lean nondiabetic C57BL/KsJ control and obese diabeticdb/dbmice were cultured in RPMI supplemented with 0.2 mmol/L glutamine, 10% heat-inactivated FBS 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 mug/mL streptomycin at 37 degrees C. Islets were treated with 4-phenylbutyric acid (PBA; 2.5 mmol/L; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) or trimethylamineN-oxide (TMAO; 100 mmol/L) for 24 h. Isolated islets from C57BL/6J control andob/obmice were treated with salubrinal (75 mumol/L; Merck, Kilsyth, Victoria, Australia) for 24 h. Insulin secretion was assessed and RNA was extracted for gene expression analysis. Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Doncaster, Australia) and cDNA was synthesized using the QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen, Victoria, Australia). Real-time PCR was performed usingPowerSYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) on a 7900HT Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). Primer sequences are provided inSupplementary Table 1. The value obtained for each specific product was normalized to a control gene (cyclophilin A) and expressed as a fold change of the value in control extracts. Xbp1splicing was assessed as previously described (12). All results are presented as means +/- SEM. Statistical analyses were performed using unpaired two-tailed Student'sttest or ANOVA. Thedb/dbandob/obmice displayed increased body weight at both 6 and 16 weeks of age as compared with their respective age-matched control mice (Supplementary Figure 1NoneandNone). At 6 weeks of age, blood glucose levels were not different among the groups (Supplementary Fig. 1NoneandNone). Thus,db/dbandob/obmice were nondiabetic at 6 weeks of age, although both groups displayed impaired glucose tolerance compared with their respective controls (Supplementary Fig. 2NoneandNone). At 16 weeks of age, blood glucose levels were elevated indb/dbmice but remained unaltered inob/obmice (Supplementary Fig. 1NoneandNone). Plasma nonesterified fatty acid levels were unchanged at 6 weeks but tended to be increased at 16 weeks of age in bothdb/dbandob/obmice (Supplementary Fig. 1NoneandNone). There was a tendency for increased plasma triglyceride levels indb/dbandob/obmice at both 6 and 16 weeks of age (Supplementary Fig. 1NoneandNone). Plasma insulin levels were increased indb/dbandob/obmice at both 6 and 16 weeks of age (Supplementary Fig. 1NoneandNone). Inob/obmice, plasma insulin levels were significantly higher at 16 weeks compared with 6 weeks of age (Supplementary Fig. 1None). In islets isolated fromdb/dbmice, GSIS was enhanced at 6 weeks but was reduced at 16 weeks compared with islets from age-matched control mice (Fig. 1None). In islets isolated fromob/obmice, GSIS was enhanced at 6 weeks but was unaltered at 16 weeks compared with their age-matched controls (Fig. 1None). Having established these metabolic indices, we next sought to measure the expression of islet-associated transcription factors, genes involved in beta-cell function, as well as stress-response genes, in islets from 6- and 16-week-old obesedb/dbandob/obmice compared with their respective lean controls. Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion ex vivo in islets isolated from C57BL/KsJ control anddb/dbmice (A), and C57BL/6J control andob/obmice (B) at 6 and 16 weeks of age. Batches of islets were cultured in Krebs-Ringer HEPES buffer containing 0.1% BSA and 2.8 mmol/L (white bars) or 16.7 mmol/L glucose (black bars) for 1 h. Insulin was measured in an aliquot of the buffer by radioimmunoassay. Insulin secretion was expressed as fold change of the level in age-matched control islets cultured in 16.7 mmol/L glucose. All results are mean +/- SEM. n greater than = 4 in each group. *P less than 0.05, **P less than 0.01 genotype effect in each age group. After normalization of the gene of interest to a control gene (cyclophilin A), mRNA levels indb/dbislets were quantitated as fold change of their respective age-matched lean C57BL/KsJ control mice. The expression levels of several transcription factors important for islet development and the maintenance of beta-cell differentiation were altered indb/dbislets. Beta2andMafAmRNA levels were significantly reduced at 6 weeks of age (Fig. 2None). Thus, the downregulation ofBeta2andMafApreceded the onset of diabetes indb/dbmice. Beta2andMafAmRNA levels were further reduced at 16 weeks of age, showing a significant time-dependent effect (P less than 0.05 for each gene). Pdx1andNkx6.1mRNA levels were unchanged at 6 weeks but were significantly reduced at 16 weeks indb/dbislets (Fig. 2None). Thus, the downregulation ofPdx1andNkx6.1was associated with diabetes indb/dbmice. We also testedId1(inhibitor of differentiation/DNA binding), which was identified recently as a negative regulator of insulin secretion and beta-cell gene expression (13). Id1mRNA levels were increased at both 6 and 16 weeks of age indb/dbislets. We also assessed changes in the expression of islet-associated transcription factors in islets of obeseob/obmice compared with their age-matched lean C57BL/6J control mice (Fig. 2None). No significant difference was observed in the mRNA levels ofBeta2,MafA,Pdx1,Nkx6.1, andId1at both 6 and 16 weeks of age inob/obislets, although there was a tendency for reduced expression ofBeta2andMafA(Fig. 2None). For all genes tested in this study, expression levels in the C57BL/6J and C57BL/KsJ control islets were similar. Changes in mRNA expression of islet-associated transcription factors and genes that optimize beta-cell function in islets ofdb/dbandob/obmice at 6 and 16 weeks of age. Islets were isolated from 9 to 10 C57BL/KsJ control and 8db/dbmice at 6 weeks of age, 13 to 16 C57BL/KsJ control and 9 to 12db/dbmice at 16 weeks of age, 6 C57BL/6J control and 6ob/obmice at 6 weeks of age, and 4 to 5 C57BL/6J control and 7ob/obmice at 16 weeks of age. Total RNA was extracted, reverse-transcribed, and analyzed by real-time RT-PCR. mRNA levels were expressed as fold change of the levels in respective age-matched controls (represented by the dashed line). Shown are changes for the indicated genes in islets ofdb/db(A,C,E) andob/ob(B,D,F) mice at 6 (white bars) and 16 (black bars) weeks of age. All results are mean +/- SEM. *P less than 0.05, **P less than 0.01, ***P less than 0.001 genotype effect in each age group. Several genes involved in beta-cell glucose metabolism were evaluated (Fig. 2NoneandNone). The glucose transporter,Glut2, the anaplerotic enzyme, pyruvate carboxylase (PC), the rate-limiting enzyme of the glycerol-phosphate shuttle, mitochondrial glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase (mGPDH), and the enzyme responsible for the majority of beta-cell glucose phosphorylation, glucokinase (Gk), were downregulated in islets ofdb/dbmice. Glut2andPCwere significantly reduced indb/dbislets at 6 weeks and were reduced further at 16 weeks (Fig. 2None). The downregulation ofmGPDHandGkwas observed only at 16 weeks (Fig. 2None). Thus, the expression of beta-cell glucose metabolism genes showed a tendency for a time-dependent deterioration indb/dbislets. Inob/obislets,Glut2,PC, andmGPDHmRNA levels were significantly reduced at 6 weeks (Fig. 2None). However, in contrast todb/dbislets, the mRNA levels of glucose metabolism genes did not reduce further with time inob/obislets. Moreover, we failed to detect a difference inGkmRNA levels at both ages inob/obislets (Fig. 2None). The expression ofKir6.2, the pore-forming subunit of the ATP-sensitive K+channel also was evaluated (Fig. 2NoneandNone). The mRNA levels ofKir6.2were significantly reduced indb/dbmice at 6 weeks, and they were reduced further at 16 weeks (Fig. 2None). In contrast,Kir6.2mRNA levels were not significantly altered inob/obislets, although there was a tendency for reduced expression at 6 weeks (Fig. 2None). The G-protein-coupled receptor GPR40 may play a role in both fatty acid and glucose stimulation of insulin secretion (14-16). Indb/dbislets,Gpr40mRNA levels were unchanged at 6 weeks but were significantly reduced at 16 weeks (Fig. 2None). Inob/obislets, no significant difference was detected inGpr40mRNA levels, although there was a tendency for reduced expression at 6 weeks (Fig. 2None). A similar pattern of expression was observed for the incretin GLP-1 receptor,Glp1r; mRNA levels were unchanged at 6 weeks but reduced at 16 weeks indb/dbislets (Fig. 2None), whereas we failed to measure a difference inob/obislets (Fig. 2None). The GIP receptor,Gipr, was reduced at both 6 and 16 weeks indb/dbislets (Fig. 2None). There was a nonsignificant tendency for reduced mRNA expression ofGiprinob/obislets (Fig. 2None). These results suggest that in contrast to the progressive downregulation of genes important for beta-cell function indb/dbislets, transcript levels are maintained better with time inob/obislets. The proportion of beta-cells within islets was similar in 16-week-old control and diabeticdb/dbmice (control: 86.4 +/- 2.0%;db/db: 88.6 +/- 0.9%;n= 3 in each group). Thus, the changes in gene expression observed in islets of diabeticdb/dbmice are indicative of beta-cell dedifferentiation rather than beta-cell loss. This is consistent with studies suggesting the importance of beta-cell dedifferentiation as a mechanism of diabetic beta-cell failure (3,7,17-19). The role of cellular stress and stress-response mediators in the failure of beta-cells in diabetes has been the subject of much recent attention (9,20). We previously reported the upregulation of several ER stress genes in islets of diabeticdb/dbmice (10). Here, prediabeticdb/dbmice showed significant upregulation of adaptive (BiP,p58,Erp72,Fkbp11, andGrp94;Fig. 3None) and deleterious (Atf3,Chop, andTrib3;Fig. 3None) UPR genes. Interestingly, expression levels of the adaptive UPR genes were higher at 6 weeks than at 16 weeks, showing a reduction with time indb/dbislets (Fig. 3None). Inob/obislets, expression of adaptive UPR genes were increased at 6 weeks and, in contrast todb/dbislets, they were maintained or increased further at 16 weeks (Fig. 3None). Furthermore, the deleterious ER stress genes were not induced inob/obislets (Fig. 3None). The transcription factor XBP1 regulates the expression of many adaptive UPR genes (21,22). In concert with the changes in the adaptive UPR, the level ofXbp1splicing (activation) was increased inob/oband prediabeticdb/dbmouse islets, and it was lowered in diabeticdb/dbmice (Fig. 3NoneandNone). These differential responses provide the first evidence that the maintenance (or suppression) of the adaptive UPR is associated with beta-cell compensation (or failure) in obese mice. Changes in mRNA expression of UPR genes in islets ofdb/dbandob/obmice at 6 and 16 weeks of age. Islets were isolated from 9 to 10 C57BL/KsJ control and 8db/dbmice at 6 weeks of age, 13 to 16 C57BL/KsJ control and 9 to 12db/dbmice at 16 weeks of age, 6 C57BL/6J control and 6ob/obmice at 6 weeks of age, and 4 to 5 C57BL/6J control and 7ob/obmice at 16 weeks of age. Shown are changes for the indicated genes in islets ofdb/db(A,C,E) andob/ob(B,D,F) mice at 6 (white bars) and 16 (black bars) weeks of age. A-D: Total RNA was extracted, reverse-transcribed, and analyzed by real-time RT-PCR. mRNA levels were expressed as fold change of the levels in respective age-matched controls (represented by thedashed line). EandF:Xbp1cDNA was amplified by PCR and digested withPstI, which cuts unprocessedXbp1into fragments. Processed (activated)Xbp1lacks the restriction site and remains intact. Processed (intact) and unprocessed (cut)Xbp1were quantified by densitometry. The value obtained for processedXbp1was expressed as a ratio of the total (processed + unprocessed)Xbp1mRNA level for each sample. These ratios are expressed as fold change of the ratio in respective age-matched controls. All results are mean +/- SEM. *P less than 0.05, **P less than 0.01, ***P less than 0.001 genotype effect in each age group. Oxidative stress has been proposed as a mechanism for gluco-lipotoxicity of beta-cells (20,23). We assessed the expression of oxidative stress-inducible genes. mRNA levels of the antioxidant enzymes heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase, and superoxide dismutase 1 (Sod1) were upregulated in islets ofdb/dbmice; time-dependent increases were displayed forHO-1,GPx, andcatalase(Fig. 4None). In contrast, we failed to detect differences in the antioxidant genes tested inob/obislets (Fig. 4None). Changes in mRNA expression of antioxidant and inflammation genes in islets ofdb/dbandob/obmice at 6 and 16 weeks of age. Islets were isolated from 9 to 10 C57BL/KsJ control and 8db/dbmice at 6 weeks of age, 13 to 16 C57BL/KsJ control and 9 to 12db/dbmice at 16 weeks of age, 6 C57BL/6J control and 6ob/obmice at 6 weeks of age, and 4 to 5 C57BL/6J control and 7ob/obmice at 16 weeks of age. Total RNA was extracted, reverse-transcribed, and analyzed by real-time RT-PCR. mRNA levels were expressed as fold change of the levels in respective age-matched controls (represented by thedashed line). Shown are changes for the indicated genes in islets ofdb/db(A,C,E) andob/ob(B,D,F) mice at 6 (white bars) and 16 (black bars) weeks of age. All results are mean +/- SEM. *P less than 0.05, **P less than 0.01, ***P less than 0.001 genotype effect in each age group. Emerging evidence implicates systemic and tissue inflammation with obesity and type 2 diabetes (24,25). Here, time-dependent increases in the expression of chemokines and cytokines were observed indb/dbislets (Fig. 4NoneandNone). At 6 weeks, the expressions ofIL-6,Cxcl1, andCcl2were significantly increased. Minor nonsignificant increases were observed forIL-1beta(P= 0.09) andTNF-alpha(P= 0.17), but these are worth highlighting because of the interest of low-grade inflammation in type 2 diabetes islets (24). At 16 weeks, the expression of all the tested chemokines and cytokines were markedly increased indb/dbislets (Fig. 4NoneandNone), as were the mRNA levels forCD68, a commonly used marker for macrophages (Fig. 4None). In complete contrast, the expressions of these inflammatory genes were unaltered inob/obislets at 6 and 16 weeks of age (Fig. 4NoneandNone). These data provide the first demonstration of an escalating inflammatory response in association with beta-cell failure in diabetes-pronedb/dbmice, juxtaposed with an absence of islet inflammation in association with successful beta-cell compensation in obese diabetes-resistantob/obmice. Furthermore, mRNA levels of proapoptotic genes,BaxandBak1, were selectively increased in islets ofdb/dbmice (Fig. 4NoneandNone). We also evaluated gene expression in islets of 6-week-old C57BL/6Jdb/dbmice compared with control C57BL/6J (Supplementary Figs. 3-5). In islets of C57BL/6Jdb/dbmice, the adaptive UPR genes were upregulated (Supplementary Fig. 4), whereas differences in oxidative stress and inflammatory gene expression were not detected (Supplementary Fig. 5). These results are broadly consistent with the findings inob/obmice, demonstrating that the different background strains, rather than theob(Lep) anddb(Lepr) mutations, are critically important for the beta-cell response to obesity in these models. We next examined the effects of enhancing signaling downstream of PERK/eIF2alpha on the mRNA changes in islets of obeseob/obmice. Isolated islets fromob/obmice were treated with salubrinal, an inhibitor of eIF2alpha dephosphorylation (26). As shown inFig. 5None, salubrinal treatment led to the expected increase inChopexpression inob/obislets. However, salubrinal treatment had no effect on the changes in the expression of islet-associated transcription factors and genes that optimize beta-cell function inob/obislets (Fig. 5None). Moreover, salubrinal treatment did not affect GSIS, which was increased inob/obislets (Fig. 5None). These findings suggest that the induction of signaling downstream of PERK/eIF2alpha is insufficient for the loss of beta-cell phenotype that accompanies beta-cell decompensation. Effect of enhancing signaling downstream of PERK/eIF2alpha on the changes in gene expression and insulin secretion in islets ofob/obmice. A: Islets isolated fromob/oband age-matched control mice were cultured in the absence (control [cont],white bars;ob/ob,black bars) or presence (ob/ob+S,striped bars) of salubrinal (75 mumol/L) for 24 h. Total RNA was extracted, reverse-transcribed, and analyzed by real-time RT-PCR. mRNA levels were expressed as fold change of the level in control islets. n= 3-6 in each group. B: Batches of islets were cultured in Krebs-Ringer HEPES buffer containing 0.1% BSA and 2.8 mmol/L (white bars) or 16.7 mmol/L glucose (black bars) for 1 h. Insulin was measured in an aliquot of the buffer by radioimmunoassay. Insulin secretion was expressed as fold change of the level in control islets cultured in 16.7 mmol/L glucose. n= 3-6 in each group. All results are mean +/- SEM. *P less than 0.05, **P less than 0.01, ***P less than 0.001 genotype effect; P less than 0.05 salubrinal treatment effect inob/obmouse islets. We next examined the effects of chemical chaperone treatment on the mRNA changes in islets of diabeticdb/dbmice. PBA acts as a chemical chaperone in the ER by improving folding capacity and trafficking (12,27). As shown inFig. 6None, PBA treatment ofdb/dbislets partially restored the abundance of islet-associated transcription factors toward the levels apparent in islets from nondiabetic control mice. The lowered mRNA levels forPdx1,MafA, andNkx6.1in untreateddb/dbislets were significantly reversed toward normal in PBA-treateddb/dbislets (Fig. 6None). Beta2mRNA levels displayed a tendency for restoration toward normal in PBA-treateddb/dbislets. PBA treatment ofdb/dbislets also led to the partial restoration toward normal of several genes involved in beta-cell glucose metabolism and function. The reduced mRNA levels ofPCandmGPDHin untreateddb/dbislets were significantly restored toward normal in PBA-treateddb/dbislets (Fig. 6None). In contrast, PBA treatment had no effect on the reduced expression ofKir6.2orGpr40indb/dbislets (Fig. 6None). However,Glp1rmRNA levels were normalized in PBA-treateddb/dbislets to levels equivalent to nondiabetic control mouse islets (Fig. 6None). These changes in gene expression were associated with increased insulin secretion in PBA-treateddb/dbislets (Fig. 6None). Furthermore, these changes were associated with upregulation of the adaptive UPR and XBP1 splicing in PBA-treateddb/dbislets (Fig. 7). The data demonstrate that improving the adaptive UPR gene expression indb/dbislets leads to the partial recovery of beta-cell gene expression and insulin secretion. Effect of chemical chaperone treatment on the changes in gene expression and insulin secretion in islets ofdb/dbmice. A: Islets isolated from diabeticdb/dband age-matched nondiabetic control [cont] mice (12-14 weeks of age) were cultured in the absence (control,white bars;db/db,black bars) or presence (db/db+P,striped bars) of the chemical chaperone PBA (2.5 mmol/L) for 24 h. Total RNA was extracted, reverse-transcribed, and analyzed by real-time RT-PCR. mRNA levels were expressed as fold change of the level in control islets. n= 7 in each group. B: Batches of islets were cultured in Krebs-Ringer HEPES buffer containing 0.1% BSA and 2.8 mmol/L (white bars) or 16.7 mmol/L glucose (black bars) for 1 h. Insulin was measured in an aliquot of the buffer by radioimmunoassay. Insulin secretion was expressed as fold change of the level in control islets cultured in 16.7 mmol/L glucose. n= 3 in each group. All results are mean +/- SEM. *P less than 0.05, **P less than 0.01, ***P less than 0.001 genotype effect; P less than 0.05, P less than 0.01 PBA treatment effect indb/dbmouse islets. Effect of chemical chaperone treatment on the expression of adaptive UPR genes in islets ofdb/dbmice. Islets isolated from diabeticdb/dband age-matched nondiabetic control (cont) mice (12-14 weeks of age) were cultured in the absence (control,white bars;db/db,black bars) or presence (db/db,striped bars) of the chemical chaperone PBA (2.5 mmol/L) for 24 h. Total RNA was extracted, reverse-transcribed, and analyzed by real-time RT-PCR. mRNA levels were expressed as fold-change of the level in control islets. Xbp1splicing was analyzed and expressed as described in Fig. 3. All results are mean +/- SEM. n= 7 in each group. *P less than 0.05, **P less than 0.01, ***P less than 0.001 genotype effect; P less than 0.05, P less than 0.01 PBA treatment effect indb/dbmouse islets. We examined the effects of another chemical chaperone, TMAO. No significant differences were observed in islet-associated gene expression or insulin secretion in TMAO-treateddb/dbislets compared with untreateddb/dbislets (Supplementary Fig. 6). In association with this, TMAO treatment had no effect on adaptive UPR gene expression indb/dbislets (Supplementary Fig. 7). These findings suggest that the attenuation of ER stress alone is insufficient to induce improvements in gene expression and insulin secretion indb/dbislets. Taken together, the data suggest that suppression of the adaptive UPR makes a necessary contribution to abnormalities of the beta-cell phenotype in diabetes-prone mice. We also tested the effects of PBA treatment on the changes in antioxidant and inflammatory stress gene expression indb/dbislets (Supplementary Fig. 8). The higher levels ofHO-1andGPxmRNA indb/dbislets were not affected by PBA treatment. Similarly, the improvement in chaperone activity was without effect on inflammatory cytokines or chemokines expression; the higher mRNA levels ofIL-6,IL-1beta,Cxcl1, andTNF-alphawere not different between untreated and PBA-treateddb/dbislets (Supplementary Fig. 8). Here, we have used mouse models of obesity with opposing disposition to develop diabetes to study the mechanisms of beta-cell compensation and failure. The data demonstrate that "robust" beta-cells of diabetes-resistantob/obmice and "susceptible" beta-cells of diabetes-pronedb/dbmice display several striking differences with time. Robust beta-cells display a sustained adaptive UPR, a preserved beta-cell phenotype, and an absence of apoptotic, inflammatory, or oxidative stress gene expression. In contrast, susceptible beta-cells display a decline in the adaptive UPR, a progressive loss of beta-cell differentiation, and the presence of apoptotic, inflammatory, and oxidative stress gene expression. The change in phenotype of susceptible beta-cells is partially reversed by PBA treatment, suggesting that suppression of the adaptive UPR contributes to the loss of beta-cell differentiation. These findings raise the possibility that the maintenance of the adaptive UPR provides a molecular link between obesity-associated insulin resistance and beta-cell compensation and, conversely, that suppression of the adaptive UPR, together with inflammation, oxidative stress, and the loss of beta-cell differentiation, underlies beta-cell failure and progression to diabetes (Fig. 8). Proposed mechanisms contributing to beta-cell compensation and failure during progression to type 2 diabetes. Obesity and its associated metabolic changes including hyperlipidemia, glucose intolerance, and increased insulin demand lead to ER stress in pancreatic beta-cells. In normal beta-cells, upregulation of the adaptive UPR facilitates the enhancement of ER capacity, maintenance of beta-cell compensation, and prevention of diabetes. In genetically susceptible beta-cells, suppression of ER adaptation together with oxidative stress and inflammation leads to the loss of beta-cell phenotype and increased beta-cell death that ultimately results in type 2 diabetes. beta-cell compensation for obesity-induced insulin resistance likely involves both increased beta-cell mass and enhanced insulin secretion per beta-cell (2,3). Interestingly, a partial loss of beta-cell differentiation was observed in islets from 6-week-oldob/obmice as well as in prediabeticdb/dbmice. This may be reflective of increased proliferation and its inverse relationship with differentiation (28,29). However, the beta-cell phenotype inob/obislets recovers rather than deteriorates with time. Perhaps beta-cell mass eventually equilibrates with increased insulin demand as a result of enhanced proliferation in the early stages combined with an absence of apoptotic signaling. GSIS was enhanced inob/obanddb/dbmice at 6 weeks of age, and this was unexpectedly associated with increased expression of adaptive UPR genes. This suggests that ER stress is an early response to obesity, but also that some features of the UPR are beneficial, helping with beta-cell adaptation in the compensation for obesity-associated insulin resistance. This is generally consistent with findings of UPR activation in obese nondiabetic human pancreata (30) and of the requirement of an intact UPR for normal beta-cell function and glucose homeostasis in humans and mice (11,31). The maintenance of the adaptive UPR under conditions of obesity may facilitate the ongoing requirement for enhanced rates of insulin processing and secretion. Our findings suggest that XBP1 activation may play a role in the regulation of the adaptive UPR under these conditions, although coordination with the other arms of the ER stress response is likely. Alteration of XBP1 activation alone has profound effects on beta-cell gene expression, insulin secretion, and apoptosis (32,33). ER stress appears sufficient to cause beta-cell failure (11,31,34-36), and its potential role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes is well-supported (9,10,30,37). However, our findings suggest that the presence of ER stress activation is, in itself, not an indicator of beta-cell failure; rather, the nature of the subsequent response is critical in the regulation of beta-cell function and survival. The expression of several proapoptotic ER stress genes, includingChop(12,37,38),Atf3(39,40), andTrib3(41), have been implicated in beta-cell dysfunction and death, whereas upregulation of the adaptive UPR may confer protection from beta-cell failure and diabetes (11,42). Importantly, the regulation of this process is not solely dependent on obesity, hyperlipidemia, or increased insulin demand because these parameters were similar indb/dbandob/obmice. Therefore, the factors leading to the decline in XBP1 activation and suppression of the adaptive UPR in diabeticdb/dbmice remain unknown. Hyperglycemia may play a role (43-47), although previous studies suggest that elevated glucose levels increase rather than reduce XBP1 splicing and adaptive UPR gene expression. Interestingly, our recent studies demonstrate that inflammatory cytokines exert an inhibitory effect on XBP1 and the adaptive UPR in beta-cells (48). Therefore, the low-grade inflammation observed in islets of type 2 diabetes models may influence beta-cell function and survival via regulation of the pattern of downstream UPR signaling. Recent studies also demonstrate complex interactions between the UPR and oxidative stress in beta-cells (37,46,49). Our studies support and extend the case for increasing chaperone capacity of the ER as a therapeutic approach for type 2 diabetes (11,50). Chaperone treatment in vivo protects against insulin resistance (27) and beta-cell dysfunction (46,51). Our studies demonstrate that part of the benefit of improving the chaperone activity of the ER in diabetes includes partial recovery in the expression of genes important for the maintenance of beta-cell differentiation and function. Because our studies were performed ex vivo, the effects are likely direct and not secondary to improvements in glucose tolerance (27,51). Our studies also support the roles of inflammation and oxidative stress as potential contributors to beta-cell failure. Both features were completely absent in the robust islets of diabetes-resistant mice but were progressively exacerbated in susceptible islets. Their precise contributions remain to be clarified, and complex interactions between inflammation, oxidative stress, and ER stress are probable and of likely importance (37,40,46,48,49). Interestingly, many genes found to be regulated by the UPR previously were reported to be dependent on hyperglycemia indb/dbislets (7). In particular, the islet-associated transcription factors and selective genes important for beta-cell function commonly are regulated by the UPR and hyperglycemia. The divergent regulation of other genes may have been influenced by the different time course of analyses, 2-week (7) and 24-h treatments for hyperglycemia and the UPR, respectively. In conclusion, our study demonstrates for the first time the markedly different patterns of time-dependent changes in islet gene expression in obese mouse models of beta-cell compensation and beta-cell failure. The unique gene expression patterns of adaptive UPR, inflammation, oxidative stress, and beta-cell differentiation in these models provide important insight into the regulation of beta-cell function and survival under conditions of obesity. The role of the adaptive UPR in the protection against diabetes has been largely overlooked in studies investigating the association between deleterious UPR signaling with beta-cell dysfunction and apoptosis. Thus, our study is the first to link failure of the adaptive UPR in islets of obese mice with abnormalities in beta-cell gene expression and progression to diabetes.
