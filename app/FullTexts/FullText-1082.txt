Accumulation and aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins (tau pathology) into neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) is a major pathological process encountered in Alzheimer disease (AD) (1). NFT are observed early in life and increase during ageing in hippocampal area (2). In AD, the spatiotemporal progression of NFT from the hippocampus to isocortical areas correlates to cognitive deficits (3), supporting an instrumental role of tau pathology in memory deficits. Individual components of the metabolic syndrome have been linked to the risk of developing cognitive impairments and AD (for reviews, see Refs. 4and5). Particularly, midlife development of obesity, a risk factor for insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, was described to increase the risk of dementia and AD later in life (6,7). Also, morbidly obese elderly individuals exhibit enhanced hippocampal tau phosphorylation (8). The detrimental effect of obesity on tau phosphorylation observed in the brain of AD patients might arise from central insulin resistance, which develops secondary to peripheral resistance (9-11). In line, central disruption of insulin signaling by insulin receptor or insulin receptor substrate (IRS) 2 gene deletion or following intracerebral streptozotocine injections leads to tau hyperphosphorylation (12-15). However, none of these studies have been performed in models developing an AD-like tau pathology. Moreover, the effects of early and progressive development of diet-induced obesity (DIO) upon tau pathology and associated memory deficits remain unknown. In this study, we evaluated the effects of high-fat diet (HFD) feeding, at an early pathological stage, on later pathophysiological development in THY-Tau22 transgenic mice, a model developing progressive hippocampal tau pathology and spatial memory defects (16). Our data demonstrate that DIO worsens tau phosphorylation and learning abilities in tau transgenic mice independently from peripheral/central insulin resistance. THY-Tau22 male mice (C57BL6/J background) were generated by overexpression of human four-repeat tau mutated at sites G272 V and P301S under the control of Thy1.2 promoter (16). Nontransgenic littermates (wild-type [WT]) were used as controls. A total of 42 mice of each genotype were housed three per cage as previously described (17). All protocols were approved by an ethical committee (AF 06/2010, Comite d'ethique en experimentation animale Nord-pas-de-Calais [CEEA]). THY-Tau22 mice (T) and WT littermates (W) were fed with chow (C) diet (RM1A; Special Diets Services, Essex, U.K.) or HFD (H; 59% kcal from fat; D12331; Ssniff). A total of 42 animals of each genotype were assigned to balanced groups (WT chow [WC], WT HFD [WH], tau chow [TC], and tau HFD [TH];n= 21/group) according to their initial body weight (WC, 22.4 +/- 0.4; WH, 22.3 +/- 0.3; TC, 20.4 +/- 0.2; and TH, 20.4 +/- 0.3 g), glycemia (WC, 150.5 +/- 6.0; WH, 148.0 +/- 5.2; TC, 156.0 +/- 4.6; and TH, 154.3 +/- 4.6 mg/dL), and insulinemia (WC, 0.31 +/- 0.03; WH, 0.29 +/- 0.04; TC, 0.28 +/- 0.03; and TH, 0.30 +/- 0.05 mug/L). Body weights were measured weekly. Noteworthy, body weights of THY-Tau22 mice at the onset of the experiment (i.e., 2-month-old mice) were significantly lower compared with WT littermates (P less than 0.001, using Studentttest). Plasma was collected at baseline and following 20 weeks of treatment at the tail vein after a 6-h fasting, and parameters were determined as follows: blood glucose (Accu-Chek Performa glucometer; Roche Diagnostics GmbH); plasma insulin and leptin measured, respectively, using ultrasensitive insulin ELISA (Mercodia AB), and mouse/rat leptin enzyme immunoassay kit (Sipbio). Total and HDL-cholesterol as well as triglycerides were measured by enzymatic method using ready-to-use kits (Biomerieux). Non-HDL-cholesterol levels were calculated by substracting HDL from total cholesterol. Both intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test and insulin tolerance tests were performed following a 6-h fast. D(+) glucose (1 g/kg; Sigma-Aldrich) or insulin (0.75 units/kg in saline; Actrapid Penfill; Novo Nordisk) were injected intraperitoneally. Blood glucose was then measured at 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min following injection. A 100-cm circular pool was filled with opacified water and kept at 21 degrees C as previously described (18). A 10-cm round platform was hidden 1 cm beneath the surface of the water at a fixed position. Each mouse was given four swimming trials per day (20 min intertrial interval) for 4 consecutive days. The start position was pseudorandomized across trials. Time required to locate the hidden escape platform (escape latency) and distance traveled (path length) were recorded using the Ethovision XT tracking system (Noldus). At completion of the experiment (i.e., following 20 weeks of diet), mice were about 7 months old and killed after 6 h fasting by cervical dislocation, and brains were removed. Brains from five mice per group were postfixed for 7 days in 4% paraformaldehyde and then incubated in 20% sucrose for 24 h and kept frozen at -80 degrees C until use. Hippocampi of the remaining animals were dissected out using a coronal acrylic slicer (Deltamicroscopies) at 4 degrees C and stored at -80 degrees C until use. Remaining samples were homogenized in 200 muL Tris buffer (pH 7.4) containing 10% sucrose and protease inhibitors (Complete; Roche Diagnostics GmbH), sonicated, and kept at -80 degrees C for biochemical experiments. Serial free-floating sagittal sections (40 mum) were obtained using a cryostat (Leica Microsystems GmbH). Immunohistochemistry was performed as previously described (17) using antibodies raised against phosphorylated (AT8; pSer202/205; Pierce) and abnormally phosphorylated (AP422; pSer422; BioSource International) tau species. 3,3'-Diaminobenzidine pixel count was performed blindly on six hippocampal sections per animal separated by 280 mum by setting the threshold to the same value for each section as previously described (17) using ImageJ software (Scion Software). Total protein extracts were obtained and analyzed as previously described (18). Bidimensional electrophoresis experiments were performed as previously described (18). Briefly, lysates were precipitated with methanol/chloroform. A total of 15 ug of proteins was dissolved in two-dimensional buffer (7 mol/L urea, 2 mol/L thiourea, 4% 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate, and 0.6% pharmalytes). Lysates were loaded on immobilized pH gradient strip 3-11 ReadyStrip (Amersham GE) and isoelectrofocused with the Protean IEF cell (Amersham GE) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The strips were layered onto a 4-12% Bis-Tris polyacrylamide gel. Membranes were incubated with total tau antibody (Cter). For Sarkosyl-soluble/insoluble protein preparations, hippocampi were homogenized by sonication in a lysis buffer containing 10 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.32 mol/L sucrose, 800 mmol/L NaCl, and 1 mmol/L EGTA with protease inhibitors (Complete w/o EDTA; Roche) and centrifuged at 12,000gfor 10 min at 4 degrees C. The supernatant incubated 1 h in 1% Sarkosyl (N-lauroylsarcosine sodium salt; Sigma-Aldrich) at room temperature was then centrifuged at 100,000gfor 1 h at 4 degrees C, thus forming the supernatant and pellet containing Sarkosyl-soluble and -insoluble tau species, respectively. Sarkosyl-insoluble proteins were directly resuspended in lithium dodecyl sulfate (LDS) 2*, and sarkosyl-soluble samples were mixed with LDS 2* supplemented with reducing agents (Invitrogen). Sarkosyl-soluble and Sarkosyl-insoluble samples were loaded onto NuPAGE Novex gels (Invitrogen) with a ratio of 1:12. For Western blots, protein amounts were evaluated using the BCA assay (Pierce), subsequently diluted with LDS 2* supplemented with reducing agents (Invitrogen), and then separated on NuPAGE Novex gels (Invitrogen). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, which were then saturated (5% nonfat dry milk or 5% BSA) in Tris 15 mmol/L (pH 8), NaCl 140 mmol/L, and 0.05% Tween and incubated with primary and secondary antibodies. Signals were visualized using chemiluminescence kits (ECL; Amersham Bioscience) and a LAS3000 imaging system (Fujifilm). Results were normalized to beta-actin, and quantifications were performed using ImageJ software (Scion Software). Total proteins were quantified versus beta-actin. Phosphorylated proteins were quantified versus total counterpart. tau Antibodies included anti-phospho(p)-Thr181 (AT270), pThr212/pSer214 (AT100), pThr231 (AT180) (Pierce); pThr202/pSer205 (AT8; Thermo Scientific); pS262, pSer396, pSer404, pSer422 (Invitrogen); Tau1 (recognizing dephosphorylated tau; Millipore); and total tau Cter (homemade antibody recognizing the 11 amino acids in COOH-terminal part of tau). Antibodies directed against neuronal markers included anti-NeuN, synaptophysin, spinophilin (Millipore); and neuron-specific enolase (Enzo LifeScience). Antibodies targeting kinases and related proteins included anti-Akt, pSer473-Akt, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), pThr286-CaMKII, Erk1/2 (p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase [MAPK]), pThr202/Tyr204-Erk1/2, pSer9-glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta), p38 MAPK, pThr180/pTyr182-p38 MAPK, pSer16-Pin1, protein kinase A (PKA), pThr197-PKA, stress-activated protein kinase/JNK, pThr183/pTyr185-stress-activated protein kinase/JNK (Cell Signaling Technology); anti-CDK5, GSK3alpha/beta, p25-p35; anti-pTyr216-GSK3beta, PP2A-C catalytic (Millipore); and anti-pTyr307-PP2A-C (Abcam). Antibodies directed against insulin-signaling actors included anti-insulin receptor beta, IRS1, pSer612-IRS1, IRS2, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/P85, pThr458-PI3K/P85 (Cell Signaling Technology); and PTP1B (Abcam). beta-Actin antibody was from Sigma-Aldrich. Phosphatase activity measurements were performed using the molybdate-based colorimetric Serine/Threonine Phosphatase Assay System (Promega), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Results are expressed as means +/- SEM. Differences between mean values were determined using the Studentttest, two-way ANOVA (2W-ANOVA), or one-way ANOVA (1W-ANOVA) followed by a post hoc Fisher least significant difference test using GraphPad Prism Software (GraphPad). ThePvalues less than 0.05 were considered significant. THY-Tau22 (n= 21/group) and WT (n= 21/group) mice were fed chow or HFD, starting at an age when tau pathology and memory impairments are slight or even absent in THY-Tau22 mice (2 months) until ?7 months of age, when pathology is significant (Supplementary Fig. 1). Although a significant lower body weight was observed between TC mice and WC mice (P less than 0.037, using 2W-ANOVA), HFD-fed WT and THY-Tau22 animals progressively and similarly developed obesity, reaching, respectively, 182 +/- 5 and 174 +/- 5% of the initial body weight, at completion of the experiment (WH vs. WC and TH vs. TC,P less than 0.001; WH vs. TH,P= 0.94 using 2W-ANOVA;Fig. 1None). WH and TH mice exhibited significant and similar increases in circulating leptin (Supplementary Fig. 2), white adipose tissue mass (Supplementary Fig. 2), as well as plasma triglycerides, cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and non-HDL-cholesterol concentrations (Supplementary Fig. 2). HFD feeding led to a significant increase in fasting glycemia and insulinemia in WT and THY-Tau22 mice. However, although both plasma glucose and insulin were similar between WC and TC animals (Fig. 1NoneandNone), they were significantly lower in TH as compared with WH mice (glucose: WH, 239 +/- 8 vs. TH, 207 +/- 5 mg/dL,P less than 0.001; insulin: WH, 1.8 +/- 0.2 vs. TH, 1.4 +/- 0.2 mug/L,P less than 0.05 using 1W-ANOVA). In accordance, the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance was significantly lower in TH versus WH mice (15.1 +/- 1.4 vs. 23.5 +/- 2.2;P less than 0.01). WC and TC mice exhibited similar glucose tolerance (P= 0.44;Fig. 1NoneandNone) and response to insulin (P= 0.15;Fig. 1NoneandNone). Glucose tolerance was markedly and similarly impaired by the HFD (P less than 0.001 vs. respective chow groups; WH vs. TH,P= 0.11 using 2W-ANOVA;Fig. 1NoneandNone). However, surprisingly, although WH mice exhibited a significant attenuation of glucose lowering after insulin injection as compared with WC animals (P less than 0.001), TH mice did not (P= 0.20 vs. TC;P= 0.004 vs. WH using 2W-ANOVA;Fig. 1NoneandNone), suggesting that, unlike WH animals, TH mice do not develop peripheral insulin resistance. HFD leads to obesity in absence of insulin resistance in THY-Tau22 mice. A: Progressive establishment of a diet-induced obesity in WT and THY-Tau22 mice (WC vs. WH,P less than 0.001; TC vs. TH,P less than 0.001, using 2W-ANOVA). BandC: Glucose (B) and insulin (C) levels at completion of experiment. DandE: Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test demonstrated significant and similar impairments in HFD-fed mice regardless of genotype (WC vs. WH and TC vs. TH,P less than 0.001 using 2W-ANOVA). FandG: Insulin tolerance test demonstrated significant attenuation of glucose lowering following insulin injection in WH mice as compared with WC animals (P less than 0.001 using 2W-ANOVA). Conversely, TH mice were not significantly different from TC animals (P= 0.20 vs. TC group using 2W-ANOVA). EandGrepresent areas under the curve (AUC) calculated from data presented inFandH, respectively. Results are expressed as means +/- SEM. degrees degrees P less than 0.01, degrees degrees degrees P less than 0.001 vs. respective chow;#P less than 0.05,###P less than 0.001 vs. TH mice using 1W-ANOVA. Open circles/open bars, WC; black squares/black bars, TC; crossed circles/dashed bars, WH; open squares/black dashed bars, TH. TC mice exhibited increased escape latency and path length as compared with WC animals (Fig. 2NoneandNone;P= 0.0013 andP= 0.03, respectively, using 2W-ANOVA). Although the HFD did not exert any significant influence on these parameters in WT animals (P= 0.96 andP= 0.36), it further increased both parameters in TH mice (TC vs. TH, escape latency,P= 0.037, and path length,P= 0.027, using 2W-ANOVA). Consistently, spatial learning was significantly different between WH and TH animals (P less than 0.001 andP= 0.0012). Day-by-day analysis demonstrates that chow-fed THY-Tau22 mice performed significantly worse that WT animals at days 3 and 4 (P less than 0.05) and indicate that, as compared with chow-fed THY-Tau22 mice, performances of HFD-fed THY-Tau22 mice were lower at days 1 and 2 (P less than 0.05). HFD potentiates spatial learning impairments in THY-Tau22 mice. TC animals exhibited significantly increased escape latency (A) and path length (B) as compared with WC animals. Although HFD did not exert significant influence on both parameters in WT animals, escape latency and path length were further increased in TH mice as compared with TC animals. Results are expressed as means +/- SEM. WC vs. TC: *P less than 0.05, **P less than 0.01; TC vs. TH: #P less than 0.05 using 2W-ANOVA. Open circles, WC; black squares, TC; crossed circles, WH; open squares, TH. Velocity did not differ between groups (P greater than 0.05, not shown). Worsening of spatial learning in TC mice was not associated with major structural hippocampal changes since neither CA1 thickness (not shown) nor expressions of neuronal (NeuN and neuron-specific enolase) and synaptic markers (Spinophilin;Supplementary Fig. 3) were changed. Given the important number of phosphorylation sites on tau ( greater than 80) (1), we first performed a two-dimensional electrophoresis analysis and observed a significant shift of human tau isovariants from the basic to the acidic pH range in the TH group as compared with TC mice (arrow,Fig. 3None) consistent with an increased phosphorylation. Evaluation of several tau phosphoepitopes using SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3None) showed that the HFD did not induce a global increase in tau phosphorylation. Rather, it promoted increased phosphorylation on specific tau phosphoepitopes. Thus, although phosphorylation at Thr181, Ser212/Thr214 (AT100), Thr231, Ser262, and Ser396 remained unchanged (Fig. 3None), phosphorylation at Ser214 and Ser404 as well as abnormal phosphorylation at Ser422 were found significantly increased by HFD, respectively, reaching 182 +/- 35, 167 +/- 17, and 151 +/- 17% of TC mice (P= 0.037,P= 0.0028, andP= 0.018 vs. TC using Studentttest). Immunohistochemical hippocampal analysis confirmed these changes. Phosphorylation was significantly increased in TH versus TC animals at both pSer202/Thr205 (AT8) and pSer422 epitopes (respectively, 190 +/- 35% of TC,P= 0.021, and 179 +/- 33% of TC,P= 0.039, using Studentttest;Fig. 3None). Expression of total human tau and of its proteolytic fragments was not modified by HFD (Fig. 3None). To study the impact of the HFD on tau aggregation, biochemical fractionation was performed, and Sarkosyl-soluble and -insoluble fractions were analyzed. The amount of Sarkosyl-insoluble tau remained similar in chow and HFD-fed THY-Tau22 mice (Supplementary Fig. 4). Conversely to THY-Tau22 animals, HFD-fed WT animals did not exhibit changes in endogenous murine tau phosphorylation as shown by two-dimensional electrophoresis and evaluation of several murine tau phosphoepitopes (Supplementary Fig. 5). However, the total level of murine tau was significantly increased in WH mice versus WC animals (Supplementary Fig. 5). HFD increases hippocampal tau phosphorylation in THY-Tau22 mice. A: Representative two-dimensional profile of total human tau (hTau) in TC (top) and TH (bottom) animals showing an increase in tau acidic species in the TH animals (arrow). B: SDS-PAGE analysis of tau phosphorylation in TC and TH animals using antibodies targeting physiological (pThr181, pSer214, pThr231, pSer262, pSer396, and pSer404) and pathological (pThr212/Ser214 and pSer422) epitopes. As shown in theleftpanel, significant enhancement of tau phosphorylation at Ser214, Ser404, and Ser422 was observed in TH mice. This occurred in absence of change in total hTau expression or tau proteolysis (Trunc. Tau). Quantifications of phosphoepitopes were performed vs. total hTau. hTau quantification was performed vs. beta-actin. Results are expressed as percentage of TC animals.

Black bars, TC; black dashed bars, TH. pI, isoelectric point. tau Phosphorylation is under the tight control of kinase/phosphatase activities. More than 30 different kinases are able to phosphorylate tau (1). Therefore, we assessed the effects of HFD on major tau kinases (Akt, GSK3beta, CaMKII, ERK1/2, cdk5, p38, JNK, and PKA). HFD feeding did not alter total expression levels of the studied kinases in the hippocampus of THY-Tau22 mice (Fig. 4andSupplementary Fig. 6). The p35/p25 ratio, representative of deregulated cdk5 activity, was unchanged in TH mice (Supplementary Fig. 6). Phosphorylation at the Tyr216 epitope of GSK3beta remained unaltered in TH animals, whereas a significant increase of phosphorylation at its inactivating Ser9 epitope was observed (136 +/- 15% of TC,P= 0.05;Fig. 4None). HFD feeding also led to a significant increase of Ser473-Akt and Thr286-CaMKII phosphorylation in THY-Tau22 mice, reaching, respectively, 165 +/- 16 (P= 0.006) and 171 +/- 23% (P= 0.028) of chow-fed THY-Tau22 animals (Fig. 4None). Finally, phosphatase activity was not significantly changed in the hippocampus of TH animals (TC: 94 +/- 23 vs. TH: 119 +/- 8 pmol phosphate/h/mug protein;P= 0.34, Studentttest;n= 4/group; not shown). Accordingly, expression and phosphorylation of the catalytic subunit of PP2A, the main tau phosphatase, remained unchanged in TH mice (Supplementary Fig. 6). In line with the absence of global phosphorylation changes on tau, the HFD did not modify phosphorylation/expression of neither Akt, GSK3beta, and CaMKII (Supplementary Fig. 7) nor ERK, p38-MAPK, JNK, and PP2A-C (not shown) in WT animals. Impact of HFD feeding on hippocampal tau kinases and insulin signaling in THY-Tau22 mice. SDS-PAGE analysis was performed using antibodies raised against total and phosphorylated forms of several tau kinases (A) or several components of insulin signaling (B). Results indicate a significant activation of Akt and CaMKII in TH animals together with an upregulation of insulin signaling. Phosphoepitopes were quantified vs. total form of respective protein. Total expressions were quantified vs. beta-actin. Results are expressed as means percentage +/- SEM of TC animals. degrees P less than 0.05, degrees degrees P less than 0.01 vs. TC animals, using Studentttest (n= 6 to 7/group). Black bars, TC; black dashed bars, TH. IR, insulin receptor. Increased tau phosphorylation was previously observed in experimental conditions mimicking brain insulin resistance (12-15). Strikingly, our data support that insulin signaling rather increases in the hippocampus of TH animals. Indeed, besides increased phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 and GSK3beta at Ser9 (Fig. 4None), increased expression of IRS1 (55 +/- 12% vs. TC;P= 0.0076, Studentttest) as well as a trend toward decreased phosphorylation at its inhibitory Ser612 epitope (-24 +/- 7% of TC,P= 0.09;Fig. 4None) were observed. This was associated with a slightly increased phosphorylation of the p85 subunit of PI3K at Thr458 (33 +/- 12% of TC,P= 0.08 using Studentttest;Fig. 4None). Conversely, HFD feeding of WT animals did not influence hippocampal insulin signaling (Supplementary Fig. 7). In a transgenic model of progressive AD-like tau pathology, our results demonstrate for the first time that early life DIO worsens both spatial memory and tau phosphorylation later in life in a manner independent from insulin resistance. DIO potentiated tau hyperphosphorylation and spatial memory impairments in THY-Tau22 mice. Further, although HFD feeding did not potentiate tau aggregation, significant phosphorylation changes at specific physiological (pSer202/Thr205, pSer214, and pSer404) and pathological (pSer422) epitopes in THY-Tau22 mice were induced. Given the important number of phosphorylation sites on tau ( greater than 80) (1), others are also likely to be modified by the HFD in THY-Tau22 mice, as suggested by the increase in tau phosphorylation seen using two-dimensional electrophoresis. tau hyperphosphorylation has been consistently associated with cognitive alterations in several dementing disorders (19) and tau transgenic models (20,21) and also associated with impaired spatial memory in WT animals treated with 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine or sevoflurane in the absence of any tau aggregation (18,22). This supports that memory worsening is likely due to tau hyperphosphorylation at specific phosphoepitopes. This is also in line with previous findings showing, in regulatable tau transgenic animals developing tau hyperphosphorylation, that memory impairments occur dissociated from tau aggregation (23). tau Phosphorylation is under the control of phosphatases, essentially PP2A, and a number of distinct kinases ( greater than 30) (1). Increased tau phosphorylation thus likely resulted from a disrupted kinase/phosphatase balance in TH mice. Our data rule out changes at the phosphatase level. Rather, we observed elevated activation of Akt and CaMKII in HFD-fed versus chow-fed THY-Tau22 mice. Previous studies suggested that tau phosphorylation at Ser214 can be mediated by Akt (24-26) and that the latter is associated with the spatiotemporal sequence of AT8 (pSer202/Thr205) immunoreactivity and NFT in AD brains (27). Phosphorylation of Akt, and of its Ser9-GSK3beta target, was also previously observed in mice undergoing repeated anesthesia, exhibiting persistent tau phosphorylation and cognitive deficits (18). Increased CaMKII activity could contribute to tau hyperphosphorylation on the Ser214, Ser404, Ser422, and Ser202/Thr205 epitopes through direct interaction or following sequential processes (28-30). Noteworthy, in contrast to THY-Tau22 mice, HFD-fed WT animals exhibited neither an increase in endogenous murine tau phosphorylation nor a change at the kinase level. Rather, a significant increase in total murine tau levels was observed. Interestingly, this occurs in HFD-fed WT mice that exhibit peripheral insulin resistance and no activation of hippocampal insulin signaling. Although the functional significance of these observations remain unclear, since HFD-fed WT animals did not exhibit memory defects, they are in accordance with previous data showing that peripheral and/or central insulin resistance increases endogenous tau expression (10,15). Peripheral insulin resistance is able to promote central insulin resistance (9-11) and is believed to trigger or, at least, contribute to key pathophysiological events underlying AD (31,32), including tau phosphorylation (12-14). Surprisingly, our data indicate that, in contrast to WT animals, HFD-fed THY-Tau22 mice do not develop peripheral insulin resistance. THY-Tau22 mice thus exhibit metabolic perturbations. Although the mechanisms underlying such differences between THY-Tau22 mice and WT littermates are currently unclear, human tau expression is not detected in peripheral organs (liver, pancreas, muscle, and adipose tissue; not shown), suggesting a central instead of peripheral effect. The relationships between central insulin signaling and tau phosphorylation in DIO models have yielded conflicting results in WT animals (10,33,34). Interestingly, our data indicate that hippocampal insulin signaling is upregulated in TH mice, attested by increased phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473, GSK3beta at Ser9, and PI3K-p85 at Thr458, effects not observed in HFD-fed WT animals, which develop peripheral insulin resistance, as well as increased IRS1 expression and activity, exemplified by reduced inactivating phosphorylation of IRS1 at Ser612. Previous reports associated central insulin resistance, promoted by either deletion of the insulin receptor and its IRS2 adaptor or intracerebral streptozotocine injections (12-14), with tau hyperphosphorylation. However, although mimicking impaired insulin signaling found in AD brains (31,32), none of these genetic or pharmacological models promote homogeneous patterns of tau hyperphosphorylation and kinase/phosphatase imbalance (12-14,35). Finally, none of them reproduce tau hyperphosphorylation and kinase profiles observed in TH mice. Given that THY-Tau22 mice did not exhibit brain insulin resistance, worsening of AD-like tau pathology induced by DIO may thus involve other obesity-associated factors, the nature of which remain unknown. One contributing factor could be the dyslipidemia. Indeed, previous reports indicate that cholesterol-rich diets increase tau phosphorylation at the Ser202/Thr205 epitopes in tau transgenic animals (see Ref. 36and discussion in this study). In addition, cholesterol-lowering compounds have been shown to be protective in tau transgenic mice (37). In conclusion, our data show that early development of obesity increases tau burden and associated memory alterations later in life in a tau transgenic model. Such worsening appears dissociated from peripheral insulin resistance and associated with hippocampal upregulation of insulin signaling.
