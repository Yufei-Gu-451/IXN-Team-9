Chronoamperometry, where a current versus time curve is measured after a step potential is applied to the electrode, is one of the important techniques in electro-analytical chemistry. The analysis of chronoamperometry at a shrouded circular disk electrode (seeFig. 1) involves solving boundary value problems with boundary and initial conditions that give rise to discontinuities in concentration and flux distribution at the disk/shroud boundary. Discontinuous integrals of Bessel functions, which are solutions to the diffusion equations, have this property; some of them have been used in heat conduction in cylindrical geometry [1]. They have also been nicely applied in treating steady state problems in electroanalytical chemistry [2,3]. However applications of these integrals in transient processes, such as chronoamperometry, at the shrouded disk electrode become more difficult and may involve current functions in the Laplace domain that can not be easily inverted analytically [4,5]. We shall report in this paper some of the mathematical results we obtained in applying a class of these discontinuous Bessel integrals to a boundary value problem related to that of chronoamperometry and compare our results with some of the results in chronoamperometry. Consider a disk electrode with radiusa, and let the origin of a cylindrical coordinate system be placed at the center of the disk withz-axis perpendicular to the disk. Also consider a reaction at the electrode, Ox+ne- greater than Red, and let the concentration of Ox,C(r,z,t), beC0throughout the solution initially. At timet=0, let the potential be stepped to a large negative value such that the concentration of Ox at the electrode is zero. ThenC(r,z,t) satisfies the diffusion equation,Nonewith the following initial and boundary conditions:NoneandDdenotes the diffusion coefficient. For the commonly used shrouded electrode there is an additional boundary condition that the flux into the shroud is zero. The mixed boundary conditions of zero flux at the shroud and zero concentration at the disk make a more difficult mathematical problem. Various techniques have been applied to this boundary value problem with various degree of rigor [6-9]. We shall consider the limiting case where the thickness of the shroud approaches zero and ignore the zero flux condition for the moment. Let us define the following dimensionless variables:x=r/a,y=z/a,u=Dt/a2, andc(x,y,u)=C(r,z,t)/C0-1; then the above diffusion equation and the boundary conditions become,NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneTaking Laplace transforms ofEq. (1)with the initial conditionEq. (2), we obtain,NoneNonewherepdenotes the Laplace transform variable. Equation (5)is solved by the method of separation of variables by lettingNone. Substituting this intoEq. (5)the following two ordinary differential equations are obtainedNoneNoneNoneNonewherexi2is the separation parameter andlambda2=xi2+p. The solutions toEqs. (6)and(7), with the boundary conditions ofEq. (4), are the Bessel functionsJ0(xix) and the exponentials exp(-lambday), forX(x,p) andY(y,p) respectively; we denote the set of product solutions toEq. (5)byg(xi)J0(xix)exp(-lambday), and try to satisfy the discontinuous boundary conditionEq. (3)by combinations of product solutions with variousxi. To satisfyEq. (3), we try to make use of some of the discontinuous integrals of Bessel functions [10] such that ? g(xi)J0(xix)dxi=-1/pfor 0 less than x less than 1. One of the well known discontinuous Bessel integral withg(xi)=ksinxi/xiwill give a constant for 0 less than x less than 1, but it does not give a value of 0 for allx greater than 1 att=0,Eq. (2). We shall try a class of discontinuous Bessel integrals of Weber withg(xi)=kJNone(xi)/xiNone-1, writingNoneas an integral, i.e.,None. Aty=0,NoneNoneFormu=1 andk=-1/p, the boundary condition at the disk,Eq. (3), is satisfied and alsoc=0 forx greater than 1. This is the only member of this group of functions that satisfies the condition thatc(x,0,t) is uniformly equal to -1 at allxless than 1. However if instead we only require thatEq. (3)be satisfied on the average, i.e.,None, then the other members of this group satisfy this condition withk=-2None-1Gamma(mu+1)/p. We shall proceed with this and take the inverse transform to obtain,NoneNoneNoneThe flux aty=0 is given byNoneNoneFor ease of calculations, the first integral is written asNoneNoneformu greater than 1, whereF(a,b;c;z) denotes the Gauss hypergeometric series [11]. Figure 2illustrates (? c/? y) aty=0 as functions ofxandu, formu=2 and 3. Forx greater than 1, (? c/? y)None=0is nearly zero, this is particularly true for smalluand forxaway from the neighborhood ofx=1. And asuapproaches 0, the first integral inEq. (10)approaches 0 and the second integral tends toNone[12] which is identically 0 forx greater than 1,Eq. (8); and the second term inEq. (10)numerically becomes almost 0 forx greater than 1 asu- greater than 0. Thus the concentration distribution given byEq. (9)approximately satisfies the condition of zero flux atx greater than 1, i.e., at the shroud. There is a singularity in (? c/? y)None=0at the pointx=1 for the case ofmu=2, becauseF(a,b,c;1) is divergent formu?2; nevertheless, the current, which is the integral of the flux over the disk area, is regular formu=2.

The intercepts of the curves at the vertical axis show the steady state current,phi(u- greater than ? ), formu=2 and 3, and they have the values 0.848 and 0.678, respectively; while from numerical simulation of the chronoamperometry at inlaid disk electrode [17,9],phi(u- greater than ? )=0.637 which corresponds to a steady state current ofi(t- greater than ? )=4nFDC0a.

Discontinue Bessel integral was used differently in chronoamperometry by Fleischman and Pons [5], their result is also shown inFig. 4, curve c.
