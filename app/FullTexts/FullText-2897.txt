Pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction is central to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. During the progression of obesity and insulin resistance, pancreatic islets of Langerhans initially increase beta-cell mass and overproduce insulin (1). The increase in biosynthetic demand induced by chronic hyperglycemia activates the unfolded protein response (UPR), while increases in circulating free fatty acids and cytokines lower endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium (Ca2+) stores (2,3), triggering ER stress and apoptosis if prolonged (4). The molecular mechanisms linking lipotoxicity and associated inflammation (5) to ER Ca2+stores are largely unknown. Sorcin (gene nameSRI) is a 22-kDa member of the penta-EF-hand family of calcium binding proteins that undergoes Ca2+-dependent conformational changes (6-10). Sorcin is highly conserved among mammals and strongly expressed in primary mouse islets (11). In extrapancreatic cells, notably cardiac myocytes, sorcin associates with the ryanodine receptor (RyR) (12), the pore-forming alpha1subunit of voltage-dependent L-type Ca2+channels (L-type VDCC) (13), and sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ATPase (SERCA) pumps (14) to modulate excitation-contraction coupling through changes in intracellular Ca2+homeostasis (12). Sorcin inhibits RyR activity (15) and plays a role in terminating Ca2+-induced Ca2+release (12), an inherently self-sustaining mechanism that, if unchecked, may deplete intracellular Ca2+stores (16). We have recently shown that siRNA-mediated knockdown of sorcin in MIN6 insulinoma beta-cells resulted in an apparent reduction in ER Ca2+stores, as judged by stimulation with an inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) mobilizing agonist, and an inhibition of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) (17). These data indicated that sorcin may be required to maintain intracellular Ca2+stores, possibly through its known capacity to inhibit RyRs (15) and activate SERCA pumps (14). Since we and others have demonstrated that elevated palmitate (2) and cytokine levels (18,19) cause ER stress and apoptosis in pancreatic beta-cells at least in part by decreasing ER Ca2+stores (3), it follows that sorcin overexpression might protect against ER stress induced by inflammation and lipotoxicity. Indeed, recent data regarding human islets showed a decrease in sorcin expression induced by TNFalpha (20). In the present report, we test this hypothesis using1) mice bearing null alleles of the sorcin gene (Sri-/-),2) transgenic mouse lines overexpressing sorcin in the pancreatic beta-cell, and3) adenovirus-mediated overexpression of sorcin in isolated human and murine islets. Murine sorcin cDNA (17) was inserted in pBI-L vector (PvuII-NotI sites), which contains a bidirectional Tet-responsive promoter driving the expression of both mSRI and firefly luciferase (21). After injection into the pronucleus of 0.5-day-old pure C57BL/6 fertilized oocytes (Embryonic Stem Cell and Transgenic Facility, Medical Research Council, London, U.K.), two founders, bearing 1 and 10 copies of the transgene (TetOn-Sri-1 and TetOn-Sri-10), were identified by PCR screening. beta-Cell selectivity was achieved using the Tet-on system and RIP7-rtTA mice, which express the reverse tetracycline transactivator (rtTA) under the control of the rat insulin 2 promoter (21). Hemizygous TetOn-Sri-1 or -10 mice were crossed with homozygous RIP7-rtTA mice to generate double hemizygous TetOn-Sri/RIP7-rtTA (hereafter named SRI-tg1 and SRI-tg10) and single hemizygous RIP7-rtTA as littermate controls. Doxycycline (0.5 g/L in drinking water) and a high-fat diet (HFD; 60% kcal as fat, mainly saturated) were administered from 4 weeks of age unless specified otherwise. Homozygous sorcin-null mice (SriNone) on a 129S1/SvImJ genetic background were generated by homologous recombination as previously described (22). In brief, the targeting construct was generated by flanking exon 3, present in both sorcin isoforms (accession no. NM_001080974.2 and NM_025618.3) withloxPsites for the Cre recombinase and inserting a phosphoglycerol kinase promoter-driven neomycin selection cassette flanked by an additionalloxPsite in the intron between exons 3 and 4. Mice were fasted overnight for 14 h. Glucose solution (20%d-glucose/water, weight for volume, 1-3 g/kg body weight) or human regular insulin solution (0.5 or 1 units/kg, catalog no. 19278; Sigma-Aldrich) was administrated intraperitoneally and blood glucose was measured from the tail vein at 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min using an ACCU-CHECK Aviva glucometer (Roche). Plasma insulin levels were measured using an ultrasensitive mouse insulin ELISA kit (Crystal Chem, Downers Grove, IL), and plasma glucose was assessed by Glucose Assay Kit (catalog no. 65333; Abcam) when above the glucometer detection limit. Plasmid pGL3-hG6PC2(-1075+124), containing the proximal promoter of the human glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit-2 (G6PC2) gene upstream of luciferase reporter gene, was generated by PCR using human genomic DNA and the following primers: forward 5'-ACACGGTACCATCCTAGACACAATCCAGCTCTCT-3' and reverse 5'-ACACAAGCTTTAAATGAAAAAGATATTCCTGGGG-3'. The resulting 1,220-bp fragment was subcloned into pCR2.1 by TA cloning, digested byKpnI-XhoI, and subcloned into pGL3basic. A nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) luciferase reporter containing three tandem repeats of a 30-bp fragment of the IL-2 promoter for analysis of NFAT activity was a gift from Dr. Toren Finkel (Laboratory of Molecular Biology, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health) (23). p5xATF6-GL3, containing five tandem repeats of ATF6 binding sites, was a gift from Ron Prywes (Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University) (24). Plasmids pLKO.1-shSc (scrambled), pLKO.1-shSRI144, and pLKO.1-shSRI457 were constructed using the pLKO.1-TRC cloning vector from Addgene (plasmid no. 10878, protocolhttp://www.addgene.org/tools/protocols/plko/) and the oligonucleotides presented inSupplementary Table 1. Plasmid pAd-hSRI was generated by subcloning the human sorcin cDNA (pDNR-LIB-SRI) in pAdTrackCMV (BglIII-HindIII sites). All the constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The adenovirus Ad-hSRI-GFP was subsequently produced as in Noordeen et al. (17). Ad-mSRI-GFP encoding the murine sorcin cDNA and Ad-Null-GFP (empty vector) were described in Noordeen et al. (17). MIN6 beta-cells were used between passages 24 and 39 as in Noordeen et al. (17). Human and rat beta-cell lines 1.1B4 and INS1(832/13) and HEK293 cells were cultured as in Noordeen et al. (25). Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 and Opti-Mem (Invitrogen), and luciferase assays were performed using a Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Human islets from normoglycaemic donors were cultured as in Hodson et al. (26). Donor characteristics are presented inSupplementary Table 2. Pancreatic mouse islets were isolated and cultured as previously described (27). Transgenic islets were cultured in the presence of 0.5 ug/mL doxycycline to sustain transgene expression. Human and WT mouse islets (10-week-old C57BL/6 mice) were transduced with Ad-hSRI-GFP, Ad-mSRI-GFP, or Ad-Null-GFP adenovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 100 for 48 h prior to total RNA extraction, GSIS, or intracellular Ca2+imaging. Total RNA was extracted, reversed transcribed, and analyzed as described in Sun et al. (28). Primers for SYBR Green assays are presented inSupplementary Table 3. Expression of each gene was normalized to beta-actin and fold change in mRNA expression versus controls calculated using the 2-DeltaCTmethod. Total RNA isolated from islets from 8-week-old, HFD-fed six SRI-tg10 male mice and six RIP7rtTA (littermate controls) was sent to the High Throughput Genomics Facility, Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford, and analyzed on Illumina MouseWG-6 v2 Expression BeadChips. Insulin secretion assays on murine and human islets were performed as previously described in Leclerc et al. (29). Secreted and total insulin contents were quantified using a homogenous time-resolved fluorescence kit (HTRF) insulin kit (Cisbio). Human islets were cultured for 72 h with either BSA or 0.5 mmol/L BSA-palmitate in 5.5 mmol/L glucose RPMI, and MIN6 cells were transduced with Ad-mSRI-GFP or Ad-Null-GFP adenoviruses for 24 h, prior to 48 h treatment with BSA or 0.5 mmol/L BSA-palmitate in 25 mmol/L glucose DMEM before total RNA extraction and qRT-PCR analysis. Western blotting was performed as in Leclerc et al. (29) using mouse monoclonal anti-sorcin (1:300, 25B3; Invitrogen) and mouse monoclonal anti-alpha-tubulin (1:10,000-20,000, catalog no. T5168; Sigma-Aldrich) antibodies. Imaging of free cytosolic Ca2+concentration ([Ca2+]cyt) in isolated islets was performed using the trappable intracellular fluorescent Ca2+dye Fura-2-AM (Invitrogen) (27). Imaging data were analyzed with ImageJ software using an in-house macro, and the fluorescence emission ratios were derived after subtracting background fluorescence. Clusters of isolated islets were transduced for 48 h with an adenovirus encoding the low-Ca2+-affinity sensor D4 addressed to the ER, Ad-RIP-D4ER, as in Ravier et al. (30). Prior to acquisitions, cells were preincubated in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate HEPES (KRBH) media (17) containing 3 mmol/L glucose for 1 h at 37 degrees C and were perifused with KRBH supplemented with 17 mmol/L glucose and 250 mumol/L diazoxide (Diaz) (catalog no. D9035; Sigma-Aldrich) with the subsequent consecutive additions of 100 mumol/L acetyl-choline (catalog no. A2661; Sigma-Aldrich) and 1 mumol/L thapsigargin (catalog no. 586005; Calbiochem). Image analysis was performed as above. Analyses were performed as described in Sun et al. (28). Data are presented as means +/- SEM. Significance was assessed by appropriate unpaired or paired two-tailed Studentttests or one- or two-way ANOVA as indicated, using GraphPad Prism 6.0 or Microsoft Excel. P less than 0.05 was considered significant. Studies involving human islets were approved by the National Research Ethics Committee London as detailed in Hodson et al. (26). All procedures involving animals received ethical approval and were compliant with the U.K. Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 or approved by the University Committee on Use and Care of Animals (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI). Animals were housed two to five per individually ventilated cage in a pathogen-free facility with a 12-h light-dark cycle and had free access to food and water. We previously reported that sorcin silencing in MIN6 cells leads to a complete abolition of ATP-evoked Ca2+release from intracellular stores and an inhibition of GSIS (17). These findings prompted us to investigate the roles of sorcin in beta-cell pathophysiology provoked by lipotoxicity, a condition known to trigger ER stress and beta-cell failure (2). In line with our findings in cell lines (17), sorcin-null mice (SriNone, standard chow [SD] fed) displayed decreased glucose tolerance compared with sex-, weight-, and age-matched wild-type (WT) controls during intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests (IPGTTs) (area under the curve [AUC], arbitrary units, WT vs.Sri-/-, 2 months old: 43.5 +/- 1.64 vs. 48.0 +/- 1.1,n= 6-10,P less than 0.05; 9 months old: 39.2 +/- 2.5 vs. 49.1 +/- 1.9,n =4-7,P less than 0.01) (Fig. 1NoneandNone). Sorcin deletion impairs glucose tolerance whereas sorcin overexpression in beta-cells improves glucose tolerance during HFD. IPGTTs (1 g glucose/kg) were performed in SD-fed 2-month-old (A) and 9-month-old (B)Sri-/-male mice and sex-, weight-, and aged-matched WT controls (n= 4-10). IPGTTs (1 g glucose/kg) were performed in HFD-fed SRI-tg1 (n= 8-9, 16 weeks old) (C) and SRI-tg10 (n =9-11, 8 weeks old) (D) male mice and littermate controls. Right panels represent AUC of blood glucose concentration during IPGTTs. IPITTs were performed in HFD-fed SRI-tg1 (n= 8-9, 17 weeks old, 1 unit insulin/kg) (E) and SRI-tg10 (n= 9-11, 9 weeks old, 0.5 units insulin/kg) (F) male mice and littermate controls. Right panels represent body weights for each group at the time of IPITTs. Values are means +/- SEM. *P less than 0.05; **P less than 0.01; ***P less than 0.001 (two-way ANOVA). CTRL, control. To determine whether sorcin overexpression might be protective against beta-cell stress, we generated transgenic mice overexpressing sorcin in the pancreatic beta-cell on the C57BL/6 genetic background, since males of this strain become glucose intolerant and insulin resistant under an HFD (31). Sorcin mRNA and protein levels were increased by at least twofold in isolated islets from SRI-tg1 and SRI-tg10 mice compared with those from littermate controls (Supplementary Fig. 1). Glucose tolerance was improved in HFD-fed SRI-tg1 and SRI-tg10 male mice compared with their littermate controls during IPGTTs (AUC, arbitrary units, controls vs. SRI-tg1: 128.7 +/- 6.1 vs. 101.2 +/- 8.1,n =7-8,P less than 0.05; controls vs. SRI-tg10: 95.8 +/- 5.4 vs. 73.0 +/- 2.4,n =9-13,P less than 0.001) (Fig. 1NoneandNone), despite similar insulin sensitivity as assessed by intraperitoneal insulin tolerance tests (IPITTs) (Fig. 1NoneandNone, left panels) and body weights (Fig. 1NoneandNone, right panels). Remarkably, the above phenotype was not apparent in vivo in the absence of beta-cell stress, i.e., during normal chow feeding (Supplementary Fig. 2). We next investigated whether the changes in glucose tolerance observed in SRI-tg andSri-/-mice were secondary to changes in insulin secretion. In vivo glucose-stimulated insulin release was assessed in SRI-tg10 andSri-/-mice by IPGTTs (3 g glucose/kg body weight). As shown inFig. 2None(top panel), plasma insulin concentrations were significantly higher at 30 min in SRI-tg10 compared with controls (plasma insulin, ng/mL, SRI-tg10 vs. controls, 30 min: 0.60 +/- 0.06 vs. 0.43 +/- 0.05,P less than 0.05,n =5-7), despite similar concomitant blood glucose values (Fig. 2None, bottom panel). Conversely,Sri-/-males showed a marked impairment of GSIS compared with WT controls, with plasma insulin concentrations barely rising during IPGTT (AUC insulin, WT vs.Sri-/-, arbitrary units: 1.01 +/- 0.23 vs. 0.53 +/- 0.10,n =4-6,P less than 0.05) (Fig. 2None, top panel), despite robust increases in associated blood glucose values (Fig. 2Nonebottom panel). Sorcin overexpression enhances GSIS without expansion of beta-cell mass, whereas sorcin deletion impairs GSIS. Plasma insulin concentration during 3 g glucose/kg IPGTTs were assessed in HFD-fed SRI-tg10 male mice (n =5-7, 11 weeks old) (A) and SD-fedSri-/-male mice (n =4-6, 9 months old) (B) and their respective controls. Top left panels represent plasma insulin values and bottom panels represent corresponding blood glucose measurements. Top right panels represent AUC of plasma insulin concentrations. C-F: Pancreatic beta-cell mass was evaluated in HFD-fed SRI-10 mice. Five consecutive pancreatic sections from 9-week-old SRI-tg10 and littermate control mice (n =3-4) were immunostained for insulin, glucagon, and DAPI (scale bars = 50 mum) (C) to quantify for mean pancreas and islet size (D), and individual beta-cell and alpha-cell area and beta-cell to alpha-cell ratio as described inNone(E). Ex vivo insulin secretion assays were performed in response to 3 or 17 mmol/L glucose (G3; G17) on isolated islets from HFD-fed transgenic (TG) SRI-tg10 male mice (n =3, 27 weeks old) (F), human cadaveric donors (n =3, seeSupplementary Table 2for donors characteristics) (G), and SD-fed WT C57BL/6 mice (n =4-5, 10 weeks old) (H) transduced with an adenovirus encoding sorcin-GFP or GFP only as indicated. *P less than 0.05 (in vivo GSIS/IPGTT: two-way ANOVA; beta-cell mass and ex vivo GSIS: two-tailed Studentttests). CTRL, control. We next explored whether the enhanced GSIS observed in SRI-tg10 islets might be secondary to an increase in beta-cell mass. As shown inFig. 2None-None, there were no significant changes in mean pancreas surface, islet size, individual beta-cell or alpha-cell mass, although there was a significant decrease in beta-cell to alpha-cell ratio. The sorcin-induced improvement in in vivo GSIS was also observed ex vivo in islets isolated from SRI-tg1/10 mice and from human and mouse islets transduced for 48 h with an adenovirus encoding sorcin. Indeed, when stimulated with 17 mmol/L glucose, SRI-tg10 islets secreted 55% more insulin compared with control islets (insulin, percent of total, controls vs. SRI-tg10: 0.372 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.577 +/- 0.07,n =3,P less than 0.05), without any changes in insulin secretion at 3 mmol/L glucose (Fig. 2None), whereas SRI-tg1 islets secreted 68% more insulin at high glucose than controls (Supplementary Fig. 3). Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of sorcin consistently increased GSIS in human (Fig. 2None) and mouse (Fig. 2None) islets at 17 mmol/L glucose compared with islets transduced with a null-GFP virus. We next assessed whether the enhanced GSIS observed after sorcin overexpression was associated with changes in intracellular Ca2+dynamics. Islets isolated from HFD-fed SRI-tg1 and SRI-tg10 mice were loaded with Fura-2 and perifused sequentially with low (3 mmol/L) and elevated (17 mmol/L) glucose concentrations. High glucose elicited a greater [Ca2+]cytresponse in sorcin-overexpressing islets compared with controls (AUC, arbitrary units, controls vs. SRI-tg1: 100.0 +/- 5.0 vs. 120.1 +/- 5.0,n =3,P less than 0.05 [Fig. 3None]; controls vs. SRI-tg10: 100.0 +/- 17.80 vs. 149.9 +/- 16.2,n =3,P less than 0.05 [Fig. 3None]). Likewise, transduction of dissociated human (Supplementary Fig. 4) or mouse (not shown) islets in vitro with sorcin-encoding adenoviruses significantly increased the number of islets displaying strong and high-amplitude [Ca2+]cytoscillations in response to 17 mmol/L glucose. Sorcin overexpression increases intracellular Ca2+fluxes and ER Ca2+stores. Cytosolic Ca2+levels ([Ca2+]c) were measured in isolated and dissociated islets loaded with Fura-2 from HFD-fed SRI-tg1 (n= 3-4, 14 weeks old) (A) and SRI-tg10 (n= 3, 9 weeks old) (B) male mice incubated sequentially with low (3 mmol/L, G3) and high (17 mmol/L, G17) glucose concentrations as indicated. Right panels represent AUC of [Ca2+]c. Acetylcholine (Ach)-induced ER Ca2+release was measured in clusters of dissociated islets from HFD-fed SRI-tg1 (n= 4, 14 weeks old) (C) and SRI-tg10 (n= 3, 9 weeks old) (D) male mice transduced with Ad-RIP-D4ER adenovirus to measure [Ca2+]ERas stated inNone. The islets were incubated in 17 mmol/L glucose in the presence of Diaz (Dz; 250 mumol/L) to prevent extracellular Ca2+influx. Left panels, representative calcium traces; right panels, quantification of the amplitude (?) of ER Ca2+depletion after treatment with Ach. *P less than 0.05; **P less than 0.01; ***P less than 0.001 ([Ca2+]c: two-way ANOVA; [Ca2+]ER? : two-tailed Studentttests). au, arbitrary units; CTRL, control. Free Ca2+in the ER ([Ca2+]ER) was measured in clusters of isolated islets from HFD-fed SRI-tg1, SRI-tg10, and their littermate controls, transduced for 48 h with an adenovirus encoding the low-Ca2+-affinity sensor D4 addressed to the ER under the control of the insulin promoter Ad-RIP-D4ER (30), and incubated in 17 mmol/L glucose with the addition of 250 mumol/L Diaz to fully open ATP-sensitive K+channels and prevent extracellular Ca2+influx (30). After acetylcholine-induced ER Ca2+release, transgenic islets experienced a larger fall in [Ca2+]ERthan control islets, indicating a higher initial [Ca2+]ERcontent (Fig. 3NoneandNone). We next fully depleted the ER Ca2+stores in islets isolated from HFD-fed SRI-tg10 male mice and littermate controls using the SERCA pump inhibitor cyclopiazonic acid (32,33) before measuring [Ca2+]cytin response to 17 mmol/L glucose. Under these conditions, the subsequent increase in [Ca2+]cytinduced by high glucose was no longer significantly different between sorcin-overexpressing islets and control islets (AUC [Ca2+]cyt, arbitrary units, controls vs. SRI-tg10: 100.0 +/- 13.5 vs. 104.6 +/- 10.3,n =3, NS) (Supplementary Fig. 5). Taken together, these results are consistent with a positive role for sorcin in GSIS and intracellular Ca2+homeostasis, corroborating our in vitro data in MIN6 insulinoma cells (17). To further explore the underlying mechanisms behind sorcin's actions, we performed a transcriptomic analysis of islets from HFD-fed SRI-tg10 mice and controls using oligonucleotide microarrays (GEO accession no. GSE72719) (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis presented inSupplementary Table 4). Interestingly,G6pc2,one of the most highly expressed genes in beta-cells (9), was strongly repressed in islets from SRI-tg10 mice. Subsequent qRT-PCR analysis in isolated islets from SRI-tg10, SRI-tg1, andSri-/-mice confirmed the inverse relationship betweenSriandG6pc2expression levels (Fig. 4None-None). Indeed, islets from SRI-tg1 and SRI-tg10 mice displayed 35 and 56% decreases, respectively, inG6pc2mRNA levels (Fig. 4NoneandNone), whereasSrimRNA levels were increased 20- and 42-fold, respectively (Fig. 4NoneandNone). In islets fromSri-/-mice, sorcin expression was reduced by greater than 90% and there was a 3.6-fold increase inG6pc2expression (Fig. 4NoneandNone). G6PC2 is an islet-specific isoform of glucose-6-phosphatase, which negatively regulates basal GSIS (9). G6PC2 is also a major determinant of fasting blood glucose in humans as revealed by genome-wide association studies (34). Accordingly, HFD-fed SRI-tg10 mice displayed lower fasting blood glucose throughout the study compared with controls (Fig. 4None). Sorcin regulatesG6pc2expression and decreases fasting blood glucose in vivo. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis ofSri(A-C) andG6pc2(D-F) expression was performed in isolated islets from HFD-fed SRI-tg1 male (n= 3 mice/genotype, 27 weeks old) (AandD), SRI-tg10 male (n= 5 mice/genotype, 8 weeks old) (BandE), and SD-fed SRI-/-male (n= 4-7 mice/genotype, 9 months old) (CandF) mice and their respective controls. G: Fasting blood glucose levels were measured in HFD-fed SRI-tg10 male and their littermate control mice aged 8, 16, and 24 weeks, as indicated (n= 9-11 mice per group, HFD from 4 weeks old). *P less than 0.05; **P less than 0.01; ***P less than 0.001 (two-tailed Studentttests). CTRL, control. We next overexpressed sorcin in human islets with an adenoviral vector and likewise observed a reduction inG6PC2mRNA levels, and in the levels of mRNA encoding the ER stress markers C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) and glucose-regulated protein 78/binding immunoglobulin protein (GRP78/BiP) (Fig. 5None). Lipotoxicity decreases endogeneous sorcin expression whereas sorcin overexpression prevents palmitate-induced G6PC2 and ER stress marker induction. A: Quantitative RT-PCR analysis ofSRI, G6PC2, CHOP, andGRP78/BiPexpression was performed on human islets (n= 3 donors) transduced for 48 h with either sorcin (GFP-SRI) or null (GFP) adenoviruses, as indicated. B: Quantitative RT-PCR analysis ofSriexpression was performed in isolated islets from chow or HFD-fed WT mice (n= 4-5, 19-week-old females, HFD from 5 weeks old). Quantitative RT-PCR analysis ofSRI, G6PC2, CHOP, and/orGRP78/BiPexpression was performed on human islets (n= 3 donors) treated for 72 h with 0.5 mmol/L BSA-conjugated palmitate or BSA only (C) or on MIN6 beta-cells transduced for 24 h with an adenovirus encoding GFP or sorcin-GFP followed by 48 h treatment with 0.5 mmol/L BSA-conjugated palmitate or BSA only (DandE). Values are mean +/- SEM. *P less than 0.05; **P less than 0.01; ***P less than 0.001 (two-tailed Studentttests). Given the apparent protection conferred by sorcin overexpression under lipotoxic conditions, we next investigated the regulation of endogenous sorcin during HFD in vivo and in human islets and MIN6 cells cultured in the presence of palmitate. Sorcin expression was downregulated in islets from HFD-fed C57BL/6 (Fig. 5None) and DBA2J mice (Supplementary Fig. 6) compared with chow-fed mice. Furthermore, human islets incubated for 72 h in the presence of palmitate and 5.5 mmol/L glucose showed a significant reduction in sorcin expression and an increase inG6PC2andCHOPexpression (Fig. 5None). Similarly, lipotoxicity experiments in MIN6 cells also demonstrated a profound suppression of sorcin expression accompanied by a robust increase inG6pc2,Chop, andGrp78/BiPmRNA after exposure to palmitate (Fig. 5None). Remarkably, adenovirus-mediated overexpression of sorcin during lipotoxic conditions in MIN6 cells prevented the increase inG6pc2,Chop, andGrp78/BiPexpression (Fig. 5None). We next determined whether the repressive effect of sorcin on G6PC2 expression was transcriptionally mediated. As shown inFig. 6None(DMSO, gray bar), overexpressed sorcin repressed the activity of a 1.2-kb proximal fragment of the humanG6PC2promoter (hG6PC2p) in MIN6 cells. Conversely, the activity of a reporter containing three tandem repeats of an NFAT binding site (3xNFATr) was significantly stimulated by sorcin (Fig. 6None, DMSO, gray bar), consistent with the increase in cytosolic [Ca2+] induced by sorcin (35). In order to confirm the roles of NFAT and [Ca2+]cytin mediating the inhibitory effect of sorcin on G6PC2 expression, we showed that NFAT cDNA cotransfection repressed hG6PC2p activity while robustly stimulating 3xNFATr (Fig. 6NoneandNone, DMSO, black bars). In silico TRANSFAC analysis revealed three putative NFAT binding sites onG6PC2promoter (not shown). We next added Diaz (100 mumol/L, inhibiting Ca2+influx) and cyclosporine A (CsA, 0.2 mumol/L, inhibiting NFAT nuclear translocation) in the culture medium. As expected, both agents prevented the inhibitory and stimulatory effects of sorcin on hG6PC2p and 3xNFATr, respectively (Fig. 6NoneandNone, Diaz and CsA, gray bars). Moreover, the addition of CsA stimulated the activity of hG6PC2p compared with DMSO, whereas Diaz inhibited it (Supplementary Fig. 7), confirming the repressive contribution of the NFAT signaling pathway. The suppressive effect of Diaz, however, implies additional [Ca2+]cyt-dependent stimulatory pathways. Intriguingly, the addition of Diaz and CsA (up 1 mumol/L, not shown) did not prevent the inhibitory effects of NFAT on hG6PC2p but prevented the stimulatory effect of NFAT on 3xNFATr (Fig. 6NoneandNone, Diaz and CsA, black bars). Sorcin inhibits G6PC2 promoter activity. Promoter luciferase reporter studies were performed in MIN6 beta-cells cotransfected with either GFP (control), sorcin (SRI), or NFAT-GFP cDNAs and -1075+124hG6PC2-Luci (A) or three tandem repeats of NFAT binding sites (3* NFAT-Luci) and pRL-CMV (B) and treated with DMSO (0.1%), Diaz (100 mumol/L), or CsA (0.2 mumol/L) for an additional 24 h before cell lysis, as indicated (n= 3-4 independent experiments). Values are mean +/- SEM. *P less than 0.05; **P less than 0.01; ***P less than 0.001 (two-tailed Studentttests). The inverse relationship between sorcin expression and the ER stress markersCHOPandGRP78/BiPprompted us to investigate the effect of sorcin on the UPR. To study the ATF6 branch (36), we chose a reporter assay containing five tandem repeats of ATF6 binding sites (24), since ATF6 is cleaved in the Golgi in response to ER stress before translocating to the nucleus (37). The activity of the ATF6 luciferase reporter was reproducibly stimulated by tunicamycin and thapsigargin, two ER stress inducers, and inhibited by the chemical chaperone 4-PBA, confirming its sensitivity to ER stress (Fig. 7None-None). Sorcin cotransfection increased the activity of the ATF6 luciferase reporter in three beta-cell lines, i.e., MIN6, 1.1B4, and INS1 (832/13), as well as in HEK293 cells, in basal (DMSO) and stimulated (thapsigargin and tunicamycin) conditions, but not in the presence of 4-PBA, compared with cotransfection with GFP (Fig. 7None-None). Conversely, sorcin silencing in MIN6 cells by short hairpin RNA decreased the activity of the ATF6 reporter (Fig. 7NoneandNone). Sorcin overexpression did not affect XBP-1 splicing, used as a surrogate of the IRE-1 branch, either in basal conditions or after thapsigargin treatment of MIN6 (Fig. 7G andNone) or HEK293 (not shown) cells, whereas CHOP repression indicated repression of the PERK branch. Sorcin (SRI) activates ATF6 transcriptional activity. Promoter luciferase reporter studies were performed in clonal beta-cell lines MIN6 (A), 1.1B4 (B), INS1(832/13) (C), and human embryonic kidney HEK cells (D). Cells were cotransfected with an artificial promoter containing five ATF6 binding sites (p5xATF6-GL3), pRL-CMV, and either GFP or SRI cDNA for 24 h and treated with DMSO (1%), 4-PBA (10 mmol/L), tunicamycin (10 mg/mL), or thapsigargin (10 mmol/L) for an additional 16-20 h before cell lysis and luciferase assay. a,P less than 0.005 for the effect of treatment vs. DMSO; b,P less than 0.05 for the effect of SRI overexpression (unpaired two-tailed Studentttests). E: Western blot showing the efficiency of two different SRI short hairpin RNA constructs (shSRI-144 and shSRI-457) after 3 and 5 days in culture in MIN6 cells. Cells were transfected with either pLKO.1-shScrambled, -shSRI144, or -shSRI457 and incubated with 1 mug/mL puromycin for 3 or 5 days before cell lysis and Western blotting using polyclonal anti-SRI (1:300) and monoclonal anti-tubulin (1:10,000). Dashed vertical white lines have been added for clarity. F: SRI silencing reduces the activity of an artificial promoter containing five ATF6 binding sites in MIN6 cells. MIN6 were cotransfected with p5xATF6-GL3, pRL-CMV, and either pLKO.1-shScrambled, -shSRI144, or -shSRI457 for 48 or 72 h before cell lysis and luciferase assay. Results are expressed as mean +/- SEM;n =3 independent experiments. *P less than 0.005, paired two-tailed Studentttests. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis ofSri(G) and spliced Xbp1:total Xbp1(H) was performed in MIN6 cells transduced for 24 h with adenoviruses encoding SRI-GFP or GFP only and treated with DMSO (0.1%) or thapsigargin (Thaps, 100 mumol/L) for an additional 24 h. Results are expressed as mean +/- SEM;n =3 independent experiments. *P less than 0.05; ***P less than 0.005 (paired two-tailed Studentttests). The findings herein indicate that sorcin lies on a pathway linking beta-cell lipotoxicity to ER calcium and ER stress, representing a mechanism for dysregulation of beta-cell function under conditions of metabolic stress (Fig. 8). Thus, we show that sorcin is downregulated in pancreatic beta-cells under conditions of lipotoxic stress (Fig. 5), whereas overexpression of sorcin is sufficient to protect against beta-cell failure and glucose intolerance during HFD (Fig. 1). Sorcin lies on a pathway linking beta-cell lipotoxicity to ER calcium and ER stress, representing a mechanism for dysregulation of beta-cell function under conditions of metabolic stress. A: In pancreatic beta-cells, sorcin is downregulated under conditions of lipotoxic stress such as exposure to HFD and palmitate or proinflammatory cytokines, as shown by others (20). The inverse relationship between sorcin andG6PC2expression levels observed in islets suggests that an important mechanism of action of sorcin is to regulateG6PC2expression to influence both ER stress and GSIS. B: Sorcin overexpression is sufficient to protect against beta-cell dysfunction during HFD. In stressed beta-cells, sorcin overexpression increases ER and cytosolic [Ca2+], decreasing G6PC2, through the NFAT signaling pathway, which would stimulate GSIS. By maintaining a high concentration of Ca2+in the ER lumen, sorcin prevents ER stress and maintains long-term capacities for GSIS during HFD. FFA, free fatty acid. Interestingly, in the absence of beta-cell stress, i.e., during normal chow feeding, the role of sorcin in pancreatic beta-cells was less prominent. Nonetheless, forced sorcin expression enhanced GSIS and [Ca2+]cytoscillations in human islets from normoglycemic donors as well as in islets from young chow-fed mice (Fig. 2andSupplementary Fig. 4). Importantly, the observed increase in GSIS in our transgenic models was not due to an increase in beta-cell mass. Rather, we observed a decrease in the beta-cell to alpha-cell ratio (Fig. 2), suggesting that the sorcin-overexpressing islets display enhanced function, and a possible resistance to HFD-induced hyperplasia (38). The improved GSIS observed in our HFD-fed SRI-tg1/10 mice is most likely secondary to the increases in glucose-induced intracellular Ca2+fluxes (Fig. 3andSupplementary Fig. 4). Although not tested here, the combined effects of RyR inhibition and SERCA activation by sorcin described in cardiomyocytes (14,15) might thus explain the increased capacity of ER Ca2+stores in SRI-tg1/10 islets (Fig. 3). In the rat heart, sorcin overexpression is associated with an increase in Ca2+transients and enhanced cardiac contractility, rescuing diabetic contractile dysfunction (39). In beta-cells, a role for RyR, in particular RyR2, has recently been supported by studies using "leaky" mutants, both in humans and in mice, which display glucose intolerance, decreased insulin secretion, and islet ER stress (40,41). One intriguing finding of the current study was the inverse relationship between sorcin andG6PC2expression in islets and beta-cells. G6PC2 acts by hydrolyzing glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) in the ER, thus opposing the action of the glucokinase (9,42). Islets fromG6pc2-/-mice display increased cytosolic [Ca2+] and enhanced GSIS (9). This suggests that an important mechanism of action of sorcin is to regulateG6PC2expression to influence calcium homeostasis, GSIS, and ER stress. Interestingly, others have found that glucose cycling and G6Pase activity were markedly enhanced in pancreatic islets of HFD-fed obese hyperglycemic mice, impairing GSIS (43). However, it is possible that G6PC2 also exerts effects beyond glucose cycling and glycolytic flux (44) and earlier studies have linked G6pase activity and G6P levels to cytosolic and ER Ca2+concentrations, both in the liver and in pancreatic beta-cells (45,46). Our study highlights several beneficial effects of sorcin in the beta-cell. For example, sorcin-induced increase in intracellular Ca2+activates NFAT signaling, which is fundamental for maintaining the islet beta-cell phenotype (47), and whose inhibition is responsible for posttransplantation diabetes caused by calcineurin inhibitors (48). Furthermore, sorcin overexpression under lipotoxic conditions prevented the induction of the ER stress markers CHOP and GRP78/BiP. Interestingly, ATF6 signaling was stimulated by sorcin, a change that, unlike the other two branches of the UPR, i.e., PERK and IRE-1, is not usually associated with apoptosis but with favorable outcomes (36,49). We note that our data may also have direct relevance for beta-cell failure in humans. Thus, analysis of unpublished results from the IMIDIA consortium (M. Solimena, A.M. Schulte, L. Marselli, F.

Froguel, M. von Bulow, M.I., P.M., unpublished data) from large sets of human donor islets indicates a significant positive correlation betweenSRImRNA levels and GSIS in both diabetic and nondiabetic islets, and a tendency toward lower sorcin levels in islets from patients with type 2 diabetes versus healthy islets. Thus, agents that increase sorcin expression or activity may increase insulin secretion while protecting against beta-cell exhaustion.
