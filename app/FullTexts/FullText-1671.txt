PALB2, a partner and localiser of BRCA2, is crucial for proficient homologous recombination repair of DNA double-strand breaks through its regulation of BRCA2 and its interaction with BRCA1 (XiaNone, 2006;SyNone, 2009;ZhangNone, 2009). Bi-allelic inactivating mutations inPALB2underlie Fanconi anaemia subtype N and have been shown to be associated with high risk of childhood cancers (ReidNone, 2007;XiaNone, 2007). Heterozygous germline loss-of-function mutations inPALB2have been associated with increased risk of breast cancer (RahmanNone, 2007). The first study that reported an association betweenPALB2mutations and breast cancer risk involved familial breast cancer cases and unaffected controls from the United Kingdom. Using only some information obtained from just 10 families, and under strong modelling assumptions, the average relative risk associated with 5 protein-truncatingPALB2mutations was estimated indirectly to be 2.3-fold (95% confidence interval (CI)=1.4-3.9) (RahmanNone, 2007). Subsequent population-based studies estimated the risk associated withPALB2mutations to be higher (ErkkoNone, 2008;SoutheyNone, 2010). For example,PALB2c.1592delT was identified in 18 out of 1918 (0.9%) Finnish breast cancer cases unselected for family history compared with 6 out of 2501 (0.2%) unaffected controls (odds ratio (OR)=3.94; 95% CI=1.5-12.1). Using the family histories of the case carriers,PALB2c.1592delT was estimated to be associated with a 40% (95% CI=17-77%) risk of breast cancer to the age of 70 years (ErkkoNone, 2008). Similarly,PALB2c.3113G greater than A was identified in 5 out of 1403 (0.4%) unselected Australian breast cancer cases and 0 out of 764 (0%) unaffected controls (SoutheyNone, 2010). Using the family histories of the five carrier cases, the estimated cumulative risk forPALB2c.3113G greater than A was 91% (95% CI=44-100%) to the age of 70 years. Therefore, population-based studies of breast cancer that have directly used the family history data have estimated that at least somePALB2mutations are associated with a breast cancer risk (penetrance) comparable to that of the average pathogenic mutation inBRCA2: 45% (95% CI=31-56%) (AntoniouNone, 2003). Mutations inPALB2are rare (varying from 0.1% to 1.5% depending upon the population) (FoulkesNone, 2007;RahmanNone, 2007;TischkowitzNone, 2007;Dansonka-MieszkowskaNone, 2010;PapiNone, 2010;SoutheyNone, 2010;BogdanovaNone, 2011;CasadeiNone, 2011;DingNone, 2011;HellebrandNone, 2011;TeoNone, 2013a,2013b) but for women carrying them, and their relatives who might also be mutation carriers, knowing their mutation status has the potential to be clinically important as carriers are at high risk of breast cancer. Identified mutation carriers could be informed of optimal, risk appropriate clinical screening and treatment. Potential therapies could include those that target homologous DNA repair dysfunction (BuissonNone, 2010). AsPALB2mutations have also been associated with increased risk of developing a second breast cancer (TischkowitzNone, 2012), risk reducing surgery and treatment might also be considered byPALB2mutation carriers. The integration ofPALB2mutation testing into clinical practice is still in progress and strategies that effectively identify potentialPALB2mutation carriers could help facilitate this important process. Characterisation of the morphology of breast cancers arising inPALB2mutation carriers and non-carriers offers the possibility of identifying tumour morphological features predictive of an underlying germlinePALB2mutation, as they have been shown for underlyingBRCA1mutations (LakhaniNone, 1998;SoutheyNone, 2011;HopperNone, 2012). This could be conducted at the time of diagnosis and therefore, be used to facilitate personalised treatment strategies, as well as enabling identification of those relatives who have also inherited a similar high breast cancer risk. Breast cancer tumour morphology can be suggestive of underlying familial, if not heritable, risk. We recently reported that, in a population-based sample of 375 women with early-onset breast cancer cases with no known high-risk mutation in a breast cancer susceptibility gene, minimal sclerosis, presence of circumscribed growth, extensive intraductal carcinoma and lobular growth patterns were independent predictors of increased breast cancer risk for their first-degree female relatives (2.0-fold to 3.3-fold increased risk for relatives,P less than 0.02 for all listed features). Relatives of the 128 (34%) index cases with none of these 4 features were at population risk (standardised incidence ratio=1.03, 95% CI=0.57-1.85), while relatives of the 37 (10%) index cases with two or more features were at high risk (standardised incidence ratio=5.18, 95% CI=3.22-8.33) (DiteNone, 2012). Breast cancer morphological features can also be used to identify women most likely to carry germline mutations in breast cancer susceptibility genes. It has been known for some time that some morphological features are more common in cancers arising inBRCA1mutation carriers (LakhaniNone, 1998). These features have been identified by studying carriers across a wide range of ages at diagnosis and ascertained either because of their strong family cancer history or through population-based sampling. Lack of oestrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) expression has also been reported to improve prediction ofBRCA1mutation status based on family history (LakhaniNone, 2002;JamesNone, 2006;MavaddatNone, 2010). Using a population-based sample of 452 young women with breast cancer, we found that just two breast tumour morphological features (trabecular growth pattern and high mitotic index) were sufficient to identify 28 of the 29BRCA1mutation carriers in the study (SoutheyNone, 2011). Moreover, prediction of mutation status using these two features was more sensitive and specific than using family history alone, and when combined, the area under the receiver operator curve was in excess of 0.9. A detailed analysis of the morphological features ofPALB2mutation-associated breast cancers has not been previously conducted. Some information about the general morphology of breast tumours arising inPALB2mutation carriers is available from work studying breast tumours carrying the Finnish founder mutationPALB2c.1592delT. Mutation carriers with a family history of breast cancer were more likely to have 'triple negative' tumours (negative for ER, PR, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression) when compared with familial non-PALB2mutation-associated breast cancers (54.5% and 12.2%, respectively;P less than 0.0001). ThePALB2c.1592delT-associated tumours were reported to be more often of higher grade and to have greater expression of Ki67, which is a cellular marker for proliferation than tumours arising in non-carriers of the mutation. Carrying thisPALB2mutation was also reported to be associated with reduced survival; comparing affectedPALB2mutation carriers, negative for HER2 expression, with a family history of breast cancer with affected non-carriers ofBRCA1,BRCA2, orPALB2mutations, the hazard ratio was estimated to be 4.57 (95% CI=1.96-10.64;P=0.0004) (HeikkinenNone, 2009). In this study, we conducted a standardised pathology review of 28 invasive breast cancers arising in women who carry a germline loss-of-functionPALB2mutation. The morphological characteristics of these 28 tumours were compared with those of a population-based sample of 770 unselected breast tumours that had undergone the same standard pathology review. The women in this study were participants in three breast cancer research resources: the Breast Cancer Family Registry (BCFR) (JohnNone, 2004), in particular the Australian BCFR; the Victorian Familial Breast Cancer Cohort (VFBCC) (SawyerNone, 2012); and the Kathleen Cuningham Foundation Consortium for Research into Familial Breast Cancer (kConFab) (MannNone, 2006). All participants provided written informed consent to participate in these research programs that were approved by the relevant ethics committees, including the Cancer Council Victoria and the New South Wales Cancer Council, and all participating sites/centres of the BCFR, kConFab, and the VFBCC. This study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of The University of Melbourne. A total of 28 women with invasive breast cancers who had been found to carry aPALB2germline mutation were included in this study. This included 24 women who carriedPALB2c.3113G greater than A (5 from the Australian BCFR, 2 from the Ontario BCFR, 1 from the Utah BCFR, 5 from the VFBCC, and 11 from kConFab). The remaining four women were from kConFab; one was a carrier ofPALB2c.196C greater than T, another carriedPALB2c.1947_1948insA, and two were carriers ofPALB2c.2982_2983insT. ThePALB2mutation carriers in the Australian BCFR, kConFab, and the VFBCC have been reported previously (SoutheyNone, 2010;TeoNone, 2013a,2013b). ThePALB2c.3113G greater than A carriers in the Ontario BCFR and Utah BCFR were identified via Taqman assay as described inSoutheyNone(2010)andTeoNone(2013a)by screening 1831 and 68 probands from these BCFRs, respectively. Probands from the California (n=2052), New York (n=849), and Philadelphia (n=403) BCFRs had also been genotyped forPALB2c.3113G greater than A using Taqman assay but no carriers were identified. The 28PALB2mutation carriers were from 21 participating families as described inTable 1. The diagnostic haematoxylin and eosin pathology slides, blocks, or digital images of the haematoxylin and eosin sections for each of the 28PALB2mutation carriers were retrieved from the diagnostic centres. A pathology review was conducted by an expert breast pathologist (EP) using a standardised pathology review tool (described below). Data on ER, PR, and HER2 status of thePALB2mutation-associated tumours were collected, if available, from diagnostic laboratories and pathology reports. The HER2 status was considered to be positive if immunohistochemical test results were ranked 3+ (higher than normal amount of HER2 protein was present) or if tested as positive via fluorescencein situhybridisation. An immunohistochemical test result of 1+ (normal amount of HER2 protein was present) was classified as negative for HER2 expression while an immunohistochemical test result of 2+ (moderate amount of HER2 protein was present) without a confirmatory fluorescencein situhybridisation test was classified as equivocal. The Australian BCFR used population-based sampling to recruit 1485 population-based probands between 1993 and 1999. The DNA derived from the Australian BCFR probands diagnosed before the age of 40 years (n=692) was screened for genetic mutations in the coding and flanking intronic regions ofPALB2using high-resolution melt analysis (SoutheyNone, 2010). The Australian BCFR probands diagnosed at ages 40 or older (n=793) were genotyped forPALB2c.3113G greater than A using Taqman assay (SoutheyNone, 2010). First, primary invasive breast tumours from 836 (56%) of these probands were retrieved from diagnostic centres and systematically reviewed by pathologists as described below and elsewhere (JohnNone, 2004;SoutheyNone, 2011;DiteNone, 2012). Among the breast tumours that were reviewed, 40 (5%) were fromBRCA1mutation carriers, 18 (2%) were fromBRCA2mutation carriers, 1 (0.1%) was from a carrier ofATMc.7271T greater than G and 4 (0.5%) were fromTP53mutation carriers (SoutheyNone, 1999;AndrulisNone, 2002;Chenevix-TrenchNone, 2002;ApicellaNone, 2003;DiteNone, 2003;BernsteinNone, 2006;SmithNone, 2007;NeuhausenNone, 2009;MouchawarNone, 2010;DiteNone, 2012). Three breast tumours were fromPALB2mutation carriers (SoutheyNone, 2010) and were included in thePALB2mutation carrier group (Table 1). The remaining 770 (93%) tumours were from women not found to carry a mutation inBRCA1,BRCA2,ATM,PALB2, orTP53after extensive screening (SoutheyNone, 1999;DiteNone, 2003;MouchawarNone, 2010). The haematoxylin and eosin-stained breast tumour tissue was reviewed and scored for morphology features by one or more trained pathologists using a standardised tool as previously applied (ArmesNone, 1998;SoutheyNone, 2011;DiteNone, 2012) and validated (LongacreNone, 2006). Briefly, tumour grade was scored using the modified system of Bloom-Richardson by assessing mitotic rate, nuclear pleomorphism, and tubular differentiation (ElstonNone, 1999). Tumours were typed into primary growth pattern (representing 75% or more of the tumour or ?60% of the tumour if a secondary pattern was present) and secondary pattern (representing ?40% of the tumour) using the World Health Organization breast carcinoma classification with minor modifications (PageNone, 1987). The carcinomas were categorised into 17 histological types: infiltrating ductal not otherwise specified, tubular, cribriform, micropapillary, mucinous (colloid), secretory, medullary (classical), medullary (atypical), adenoid cystic, metaplastic, lobular (classical), lobular (trabecular), lobular (alveolar), lobular (solid), tubulo (lobular), pleomorphic lobular, or other. Tumours were classified as having a primary histological type with no secondary type if greater than 70% of the tumour presented with features characteristic of the histological type. Tumours were also classified as having both a primary (60%) and a secondary histological type (40%) if the tumour presented with features characteristic of two histological types. Sclerosis of the tumour was defined as fibrosis composed of fibroblasts and/or collagen that is devoid of tumour cells (Van den EyndenNone, 2008;DiteNone, 2012). The presence of extensive sclerosis is similar to a fibrotic focus as defined by Van den Endenet al(2008), which has been shown to be easily assessable and reproducible morphological feature in breast cancer (Van den EyndenNone, 2007). A tumour was defined to have minimal sclerosis if ?20% of the tumour volume contained sclerosis and defined to contain extensive sclerosis if greater than 20% of the tumour volume consisted of sclerosis. Information of the remaining tumour features from the pathology reviews was extracted as 'present' or 'absent' for statistical analysis as presented inTable 2. The ER and PR status were obtained from immunohistochemical testing of tumour tissues or from histopathology reports held by cancer registries (ArmesNone, 1999) or diagnostic laboratories (McCredieNone, 2003). The ER and PR status were available for ?90% of the retrieved tumours of non-carriers ofPALB2mutations (746 and 745 tumours, respectively). Missing data for tumour morphology features (average 4 (0.5%) missing per feature) were estimated using multiple imputation, made possible by the correlations between different morphological features (seeSoutheyNone, 2011andDiteNone, 2012). Multiple linear logistic regression was used to estimate the OR and 95% CI for associations between each of the morphological features and carrier status (PALB2mutation carriersvsnon-carriers of high-risk mutations,PALB2mutation carriersvs BRCA1mutation carriers andPALB2mutation carriersvs BRCA2mutation carriers), after adjusting for the number of affected first-degree relatives, number of affected second-degree relatives and age at diagnosis. These adjustments were necessary given that sampling of some carriers was from cases selected specifically because they had a family history and/or an early age at diagnosis. For the multivariate models, the best-fitting model was identified by stepwise selection, starting with the most significant variable and testing the addition of each of the remaining variables. All analyses were performed with Stata Version 11 (StataCorp, 2009). Following convention, all statistical tests were two-sided andP-values less than 0.05 were considered as nominally statistically significant. The positive and negative predictive values of a morphological feature forunselected caseswere calculated based on the prevalence ofPALB2c.3113G greater than A affected carriers in a population-based study (0.36%) (SoutheyNone, 2010) and the prevalence of the morphological feature in the Australian BCFR breast cancer cases recruited by population-based sampling. Table 3shows that having minimal sclerosis was associated withPALB2mutation status (OR=19.7; 95% CI=6.0-64.6;P=5 * 10-7). This association of minimal sclerosis remains strongly significant even after correcting for multiple comparisons (Bonferroni correction). There was marginal evidence for an association betweenPALB2mutation status and having minimal tubule formation (OR=5.6; 95% CI=1.3-24.2;P=0.02), having lobular carcinomain situ(OR=5.7; 95% CI=1.1-29.4;P=0.04), having circumscribed growth (OR=2.9; 95% CI=1.0-8.5;P=0.05), and being ER positive (OR=3.9; 95% CI=0.95-16.3;P=0.06). There was no evidence that any of the other tumour morphological features was associated withPALB2mutation status. Figure 1shows examples of tumours with and without sclerosis, circumscribed growth, and tubule formation. After adjusting for having minimal sclerosis, no other feature was significantly associated withPALB2mutation status. With respect to the immunohistochemistry of tumours arising inPALB2mutation carriers, information on ER and PR expression was available for 19PALB2mutation carriers; 11 (58%) were ER+/PR+, 6 (32%) were ER+/PR-, and only 2 (11%) were ER-/PR-. This distribution was different to that for non-carriers from the Australian BCFR (P=0.002). Of the non-carriers from the Australian BCFR with information available on ER and PR expression, 387 (56%) were ER+/PR+, 56 (8%) were ER+/PR-, 78 (11%) were ER-/PR+, and 167 (24%) were ER-/PR-. Expression status of HER2 was available for fivePALB2mutation-associated tumours (data not shown), and only one of these tumours had the triple negative (ER-/PR-/HER2-) phenotype. The Australian BCFR does not currently have data on HER2 expression. Forunselected cases, the positive and negative predictive values of minimal sclerosis as a predictive feature of the carrier status ofPALB2c.3113G greater than A were 2.5% and 99.9%, respectively. Table 4presents the individual associations of minimal sclerosis withPALB2,BRCA1, andBRCA2mutation-associated tumours when compared with tumours of non-carriers of high-risk mutations. When compared with tumours arising inPALB2mutation carriers, those arising inBRCA1mutation carriers were more likely to have a high mitotic count ( greater than 50;P=0.004), extensive sclerosis (OR=0.21; 95% CI=0.05-0.99,P=0.05), and necrosis (P=0.01), be ER negative (P=0.001) and PR negative (P=0.03), and less likely to have a lobular growth pattern (P=0.02). When compared with tumours arising inPALB2mutation carriers, those arising inBRCA2mutation carriers were more likely to have extensive sclerosis (OR=0.06, 95% CI=0.004-0.88,P=0.04). This report brings together several lines of evidence that support the relevance of genetic information aboutPALB2to breast cancer clinical genetics services. Is it now time for this information to be made available to women who are seeking advice and explanation for their person and family history of breast cancer? The appropriate translation of new genetic information requires clear evidence and cost-benefit analysis. In the specific example ofPALB2,there are several characterised genetic epidemiological features of the mutation spectrum that need to be considered and managed in the process of translation. First, is information aboutPALB2mutation status clinically relevant? Several reports now provide evidence that the risk of breast cancer associated with at least somePALB2mutations is of the same magnitude as that associated with 'high-risk' mutations in other cancer susceptibility genes such asBRCA2andMSH2(AntoniouNone, 2003;ErkkoNone, 2008;SoutheyNone, 2010;WinNone, 2012). Risks of this magnitude support the relevance of this information to clinical genetic services, but what use is this information to women who might be carriers of mutations inPALB2and at high risk of cancer? For affected women, and especially those identified as carriers ofPALB2mutations at the time of diagnosis, there is the potential for treatment that target homologous DNA repair dysfunction (BuissonNone, 2010). There is also the importance of advising on and managing the high risk of breast cancer that could involve risk reducing surgery (for both affected and unaffected carriers) and the potential for gene-specific medical risk reduction. Second, mutations inPALB2are very rare and thus, without additional information, application of traditional genetic counselling and testing regimes would be costly and identify very few carriers. We estimated that the positive predictive value of minimal sclerosis for unselected cases would be about 2.5%, but this estimate has a wide CI due to the lack of precise knowledge about the prevalence ofPALB2mutations in such cases. It should be noted, however, that given the high penetrance ofPALB2mutations, they will be more common in cases with a family history of breast cancer, as areBRCA1andBRCA2mutations. Therefore, it would be expected that the positive predictive value of minimal sclerosis will be substantially greater for cases with a family history. In the Australian and other settings, there is also the potential to consider testing for specific mutations inPALB2that are found more commonly in these populations (RahmanNone, 2007;ErkkoNone, 2008;SoutheyNone, 2010;TeoNone, 2013a,2013b). At present, this might represent some cost saving at the level of genetic testing at the laboratory bench. The increasing introduction of massively parallel sequencing into the diagnostic testing laboratory continues to reduce the cost of testing and expand the genetic distance that can be covered in single instrument runs. This advancement in technology could result in making the detection ofPALB2mutations a natural part of clinical genetic testing, even in contexts other than breast cancer. Third, this study provides important information that could help translation of genetic information aboutPALB2into clinical use. Similar to the way that pathology has been used to facilitate the identification of women who carry germline mutations inBRCA1and the identification of carriers of mismatch repair genes (SoutheyNone, 2005,2011;HopperNone, 2012), the new information presented here could be used to facilitate the identification of carriers ofPALB2mutations at the time of diagnosis, even irrespective of family history. It is also of note that the key feature associated with carrying aPALB2mutation (minimal sclerosis in the breast tumour) is also a feature that distinguishesPALB2mutation carriers fromBRCA1(P=0.05) andBRCA2(P=0.04) mutation carriers. Moreover, we have previously shown that, even without knowledge of germlinePALB2mutation status, minimal sclerosis is associated with about a five-fold increased risk for relatives of women with early-onset breast cancer (DiteNone, 2012). The presence of central sclerosis is more frequently identified in basal-like breast cancers, and has been associated with a worse prognosis (FulfordNone, 2006;MargineanNone, 2010). Therefore, inclusion of this feature in standard pathology review, particularly for early-onset cases, could help identify families carrying high-risk genetic mutations through means other than conventional approaches based on family cancer history. Despite the key interactions of PALB2 with both BRCA1 and BRCA2 in the same complex during homologous recombination repair, our results, overall, do not provide evidence of similarities in tumour morphological features between tumours arising inPALB2,BRCA2, orBRCA1mutation carriers. However, it is interesting that we observed five lobular or pleomorphic lobular carcinomas (observed as primary or as secondary histological type) in women withPALB2mutations that were diagnosed before the age of 50 years (ranging from 37 years to 47 years) and to note that in a population-based study of early-onset breast cancer (diagnosis under the age of 40 years), tumours arising inBRCA2mutation carriers were more frequently pleomorphic lobular carcinomas compared with those arising in non-carriers ofBRCA1orBRCA2mutations (ArmesNone, 1998). There has also been consistent evidence that the proportion of ER-negative breast tumours increases with age at diagnosis forBRCA2mutation carriers (P=1.2 * 10-5andP=0.02 reported byMavaddatNone, 2010andEerolaNone, 2005, respectively). It is important to note that the majority of tumours (24 out of 28) that have undergone pathology review in this study have been derived from carriers of thePALB2c.3113G greater than A mutation. Therefore, it is unclear whether the predictive value of having minimal sclerosis is specific toPALB2c.3113G greater than A or whether it could be extended to allPALB2mutations. Due to the rarity ofPALB2loss-of-function mutations, an international effort to combine data for a large number of carriers ofPALB2loss-of-function mutations is required to validate tumour morphological features associated withPALB2mutation status observed in this study. A larger study would also allow for the data to be stratified by age at diagnosis to examine the potential for age-dependent associations with tumour morphology (as is evident forBRCA1mutation carriers;HopperNone, 2012) and for somePALB2mutations to be associated with triple negative breast cancer (HeikkinenNone, 2009;Tischkowitz Xia, 2010). Note, however, that our study has found no evidence that the tumours ofPALB2mutation carriers are more likely to be triple negative, and instead found that if anything they might be less likely.
