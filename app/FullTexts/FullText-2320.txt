NoneNoneNoneNoneRequest a flexible sigmoidoscopyRequest a colonoscopyRequest a CT pneumocolonThis patient has iron deficiency anaemia associated with a change in bowel habit and blood in the stool. The most important possible diagnosis is carcinoma of the colon. A colonoscope is a flexible camera which can visualise the whole colon. Up to 1.4% per cent of patients with colon cancer have more than one lesion in the bowel (synchronous lesions). NoneNoneNoneFlexible sigmoidoscopy would be inadequate as the whole colon needs to be visualized, not just the left hand side. It is not possible to take biopsies during a CT pneumocolon. An endoscopy would still need to be done to confirm a diagnosis. A recent Cochrane review found that faecal occult blood test screening is likely to avoid approximately 1 in 6 colorectal cancer deaths. NoneNo ethical approval required for this study.
