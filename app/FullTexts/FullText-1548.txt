Brassica napus(2n=38, AACC) is one of the most important oilseed crops worldwide. Increasing oil yield is the foremost objective ofB. napusbreeding programmes. InB. napus, the oil yield is simultaneously determined by seed yield and oil content. Much effort has focused on identifying a germplasm and hybrid cross with higher seed oil content. A remarkable advancement was the development of yellow-seededB. napus, which has a significantly thinner seed coat, lower husk proportion, higher oil content, and much lower crude oil pigment content than the black-seeded type (Olsson, 1960;StringamNone, 1974;TangNone, 1997;MengNone, 1998). However, the genetic mechanism underlying seed coat colour formation inB. napusis not well understood, and 1-4 genes are thought to be involved in this process (SomersNone, 2001;LiuNone, 2005;XiaoNone, 2007;ZhangNone, 2011). The seed coat colour ofB. napusis determined by the content of phenolic compounds cyanidin and procyanidins (Marles and Gruber, 2004;AkhovNone, 2009;NesiNone, 2009). Flavonoids possess diverse chemical structures with a common C6-C3-C6body. According to the linkage position of the aromatic ring, the saturation level, and the oxidation degree of the C-ring, flavonoids are classified into flavonols, anthocyanins, phlobaphenes, isoflavones, and proanthocyanidins (PAs) (Winkel-Shirley, 2001). Both cyanidin and procyanidins are phenolic compounds belonging to the PA class of flavonoids. InB. napus, the coats of the black-seeded variety have a higher flavonol and procyanidin content than do those of the yellow-seeded variety (AkhovNone, 2009). In matureB. napusseeds, the coat is usually dark brown to black (FuNone, 2007). A previous study reported that the seed coats ofB. napusaccumulate high amounts of insoluble PAs (in-PAs), which are difficult to quantify. AugerNone(2010)further demonstrated that soluble PA starts to accumulate early in embryogenesis in the micropyle-chalaza area and continues to collect during mid to late embryogenesis in the seed body. The flavonols present inBrassicaseeds are kaempferol derivatives, quercetin derivatives, isorhamnetin derivatives, and epicatechin glucoside, and flavonols were also detected in the vegetative parts and inflorescences ofBrassicaspp. (RomaniNone, 2006;Lin and Harnly, 2009,2010). The phenylpropanoid and flavonoid pathway synthesizes a large array of secondary metabolites and has now been well characterized by the identification and functional analysis of severalArabidopsis thalianamutants (Winkel-Shirley, 2002;Bharti and Khurana, 2003;GachonNone, 2005). Research inArabidopsishas shown that the pathway starts with the conversion ofl-phenylalanine intotrans-cinnamic acid by phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) (Supplementary Fig. S1available atJXBonline). Trans-cinnamic acid is hydroxylated by cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H) to formp-coumaric acid (Russell, 1971), and 4-coumarate:CoA ligase (4CL) then convertsp-coumaric acid into its coenzyme-A ester, which is the precursor of various phenylpropanoid derivatives, including flavonoids, lignins, and isoflavonoids (Winkel-Shirley, 2002). The formation of tetrahydroxychalcone, the precursor of all flavonoids, is catalysed by chalcone synthase (CHS), which is encoded byTRANSPARENT TESTA 4(TT4) (Burbulis and Winkel-Shirley, 1999). This is the first dedicated step of flavonoid biosynthesis in higher plants, and is thus critical for many important flavonoid-related characteristics, such as seed coat colour, flower colour, and pigmentation of the stem and leaf surface (HoffmannNone, 2006;KasaiNone, 2007). Chalcone is converted into naringenin by chalcone isomerase (CHI), which is encoded byTT5. Subsequently, naringenin is converted into dihydrokaempferol and dihydroquercetin by flavone 3-hydroxylase (F3H; also known as TT6) and flavone 3'-hydroxylase (F3'H; also known as TT7) (Holton and Cornish, 1995;Pelletier and Shirley, 1996;WismanNone, 1998;SchoenbohmNone, 2000;Grotewold, 2006). Then, the products are further metabolized via two biosynthetic branches (Supplementary Fig. S1). On one branch, dihydrokaempferol and dihydroquercetin are converted into leucocyanidin and leucopelargonidin, respectively, by DFR (TT3). Leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase (LODX) then catalyses the conversion of leucocyanidin and leucopelargonidin into cyanidin and pelargonidin, respectively (AbrahamsNone, 2003). In the last step, cyanidin is converted into epicatechin by anthocyanidin reductase (ANR; also called BAN). On the other branch, dihydrokaempferol and dihydroquercetin are converted by flavonol synthase (FLS) to flavonols, such as kaempferol and quercetin. Quercetin can be converted into isorhamnetin byO-methyl transferase (OMT). These products are believed to be synthesized in the cytoplasm and transported to the vacuole by some transporters, such as TT12 (MarinovaNone, 2007;Zhao and Dixon, 2009). In addition,TT19(SunNone, 2012) was shown to encode a GST (glutathioneS-transferase) protein related to flavonoid transport to the vacuole. Kaempferol, quercetin, and isorhamnetin are colourless or pale yellow, while cyanidin and pelargonidin are pink-red in the cytoplasm and pink-purple in the vacuole. Epicatechin units are polymerized to procyanidin oligomers and then oxidized to form insoluble procyanidins by TT10 (PourcelNone, 2005;ZhaoNone, 2010). BANencodes one anthocyanidin reductase and is involved in plant flavonoid biosynthesis (AlbertNone, 1997;DevicNone, 1999;XieNone, 2003;BaudryNone, 2004). The expression of the underlying biosynthetic genes is regulated by a set of transcription factors and regulatory genes, such asTT2,TT8,TT1,TTG1, andTTG2(NesiNone, 2000,2001;ChiuNone, 2010). In this study, cDNAs for phenylpropanoid biosynthetic genes (PAL,C4HA, andC4HB), flavonoid biosynthetic genes (CHS,CHI,F3H,F3'H,DFR,LDOX,LAR,TT12,BAN, andTT10), and regulatory genes (TT2,TTG1,TTG2, andTT8) were isolated from the seeds ofB. napus. Differential transcriptional profiles of these genes in the black-seeded coat parent ZY821 and the yellow-seeded coat parent GH06 were analysed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) at seven different seed developmental stages. In parallel, the spatiotemporal accumulation of polyphenol compounds in different development stages of ZY821 and GH06 was analysed using toluidine blue O (TBO). Moreover, the accumulation of flavonols, PAs, and in-PAs in the seed coat was also quantified by HPLC-DAD-MS (high-performance liquid chromatography with diode-array detection and mass spectrometry). The results suggest that the differential expression of flavonoid biosynthetic genes plays a crucial role in determining the seed coat pigmentation patterns of black- and yellow-seededB. napus. Inbred lines of GH06 and ZY821 were used to represent typical yellow- and black-seeded genotypes ofB. napus, respectively. ZY821 is a major variety of rapeseed that has been cultivated in China since the 1980s and has a 39.69% oil content, 29.81% protein content, and 19.75% fibre content (Supplementary Fig. S2A,C,EatJXBonline). GH06 is a yellow-seeded rape that is used as one of the breeding parents in the Chongqing Rapeseed Technology Research Center (CRTRC) and has a 44.57% oil content, 33.65% protein content, and 14.57% fibre content (Supplementary Fig. S2B,D,F). The plants were grown under normal field conditions at the CRTRC in 2010. Field management essentially followed normal agronomic procedures. Seeds of the two parental lines (i.e. GH06 and ZY821) were harvested and used for total RNA isolation at seven developmental stages, namely 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, and 49 days after pollination (DAP). Brassica napusseeds were harvested at 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, and 49 DAP and immediately fixed for 24h at 4 degrees C in a fixation solution containing 5% acetic acid, 5% formaldehyde, and 50% ethanol. Following fixation, seeds were dehydrated at 60min intervals through a 20% step-graded series of ethanol-water mixtures, ending at 100% ethanol. Then, the seeds were processed at 60min intevals through a 30% step-graded series of ethanol-TBA (tert-butyl alcohol) mixtures, ending at 100% TBA. Seeds were subsequently infiltrated over a 24h period with saturated paraffin-TBA mixtures, and then embedded over a 48h period in paraffin. Blocks were completely polymerized at 4 degrees C.Semi-thin (5-8 mum thick) sections were cut with a microtome blade R-35 (Feather Safety Razor Co., Ltd Medical Division, Japan) and viewed under a stereo microscope (SZX12, Olympus, Japan). Three blocks were sectioned for each time point, and a minimum of 60 sections were collected for each block. Sections were stained with TBO and observed with a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope (Nikon Instruments, Japan). Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) solvents were from Fisher Scientific (Rockford, IL, USA); ultra-pure water was obtained using a model MilliQ Plus system from Millipore (Billerica, MA, USA). Flavonoid standards were from Indofine (Somerville, NJ, USA), Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO, USA), and Chromax (Irvine, CA, USA). Frozen fresh seed material (100mg fresh weight) was homogenized in 80% methanol (1ml), and the suspension was placed in an ultrasonic bath for 1h. The extract was centrifuged (13 000rpm, 20min) and the supernatant was filtered. The samples were immediately subjected to LC-UV-MS analysis. The in-PA measurement method was followed as previously described byLiangNone(2006). Plant extracts were analysed with an Agilent 1100 HPLC system (Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, CA, USA) combined with an iron trap mass spectrometer and a Bruker Esquire 3000 (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen Germany). Instrument analyses were carried out using a Grace column (20*250mm, grain diameter 4.6 mum). UV spectra were obtained by scanning from 200nm to 600nm. The mobile phase consisted of (A) water containing 0.1% formic acid (v/v) and (B) acetonitrile, using the following binary gradient: 0-5min, isocratic 95% A and 5% B; 5-10min, isocratic 10% B; 10-17min, isocratic 17% B; 17-25min, isocratic 25% B; 25-30min, isocratic 30% B; 30-55min, isocratic 55% B; 55-65min, isocratic 70% B; 65-70min, isocratic 5% B; and 70-75min, isocratic 95% A and 5% B. The flow rate was 0.8ml min-1and the temperature of the column was maintained at 25 degrees C. Negative-ion electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectra was employed, using an ion source voltage of 3.5kV, a counter current nitrogen flow set at a pressure of 12 psi, and a capillary temperature of 350 degrees C. Mass spectra were recorded over the range 50-2200m/z. The Bruker ion-trap mass spectrometer (ITMS) was operated using an ion current control (ICC) of ~10 000 with a maximum acquisition time of 100ms. Tandem mass spectra were obtained in manual mode for targeted masses using an isolation width of 2.0, fragmentation amplitude of 2.2, and threshold set at 6000. Total RNA was extracted using the Plant RNA Mini Kit (Watson Biotechnologies, Inc., China). RNA aliquots were treated with RNase-free DNase I (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) to remove any DNA contamination. The quality and concentration of total RNA samples were assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis and spectrophotometry. Primers for amplifying partial sequences of the genes involved in the phenylpropanoid (PALandC4H) and flavonoid biosynthesis pathways and of those encoding transcription factors involved in these pathways were designed from conserved nucleotide regions identified by multiple alignments of sequences (Supplementary file 1atJXBonline) fromArabidopsisandB. napusobtained from public databases at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/) and the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (http://www.arabidopsis.org/). Gene sequences ofB. rapaandB. oleraceawere obtained from public databases at the Brassica database (BRAD;http://brassicadb.org/brad/) and The Brassica oleracea Genome Database (Bolbase;http://www.ocri-genomics.org/bolbase/). Primer sequences used for the qRT-PCR are listed inSupplementary Table S1. First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 mug of each RNA sample in a 20 mul reaction volume with Oligo dT-Adaptor Primer using the RNA PCR Kit (AMV) Ver. 3.0 (TaKaRa). Brassica napus 26S rRNAwas used as the internal control to monitor sample uniformity of initial RNA input and reverse transcription efficiency. The specific primers were F26S (5'-CACAATGATAGGAAGAGCCGAC-3') and R26S (5'-CAAGGGAACGGGCTTGGCAGAATC-3'). The amplification protocol used for Bn26S was 94 degrees C for 2min, followed by 21 cycles of amplification (94 degrees C for 45 s, 60 degrees C for 45 s, and 72 degrees C for 1min), and then 72 degrees C for 10min. Real-time PCR was conducted using SYBR(r)Premix Ex TaqTM II (Perfect Real Time) (TaKaRa) in a typical 20 mul PCR mixture that included 10 mul of SYBR(r)Premix Ex TaqTM II, 1-5 mul of template cDNA, and 0.4 muM of each PCR primer. Cycling conditions were 95 degrees C for 2min, followed by 40 cycles at 95 degrees C for 20 s, 56 degrees C for 1min, and 72 degrees C for 30 s, and samples were run on the Stratagene Mx3000P Real-Time PCR System (Stratagene) as described previously (FrickerNone, 2007). To determine the cellular distribution of polyphenol compounds in developing seeds of black- (ZY821) and yellow-seeded (GH06)B. napus, a histochemical analysis of seeds harvested at different developmental stages was performed. TBO staining of transverse sections of developing seeds revealed that seed coats lacked polymeric phenolic compounds at 7 DAP (Fig. 1A,H), and that these compounds began to accumulate in the hilum of seeds at 14 DAP (Fig. 1B,I). At these early time points, staining was similar in ZY821 and GH06. At 21 DAP, ZY821 stained more intensely than GH06, indicating that more polymeric phenolic compounds had accumulated in ZY821 (Fig. 1C,J). The distribution of polymeric phenolic compounds was significantly different at 28 DAP. Whereas these compounds were mainly distributed to the palisade and pigment layers of the seed coat in ZY821 (Fig. 1D), they accumulated in the hilum of GH06 seeds (Fig. 1K). At 35 DAP, polymeric phenolic compound accumulation had increased more significantly in the palisade and pigment layers of ZY821 seed coats than in those of GH06 (Fig. 1E,L). However, the pigment layer of GH06 seeds accumulated more polymeric phenolic compounds near the hilum than did that of ZY821 (Fig. 1L). During late developmental stages (42 and 49 DAP), significant differences in polymeric phenolic compounds were particularly obvious in the palisade and pigment layers of the ZY821 and GH06 seed coats (Fig. 1F,G,M,N).

Black arrows, accumulation site for polymeric phenolic compounds; nu, nucleus; v, vacuole; e, epidermis; s, subepidermis; pal, palisade layer; pig, pigment layer; hi, hilum; em, embryo; co, cotyledon. These data show that polymeric phenolic compounds localize mainly to the palisade and pigment layers of the seed coat of black-seeded ZY821. In contrast, these compounds were mainly distributed near the hilum of the pigment layer of yellow-seeded GH06 seed coats (Fig. 1). PA and polyphenol compounds gradually increase during seed maturation and show significant differences in the seed coats of ZY821 and GH06. Moreover, the PA and polyphenol compounds were more abundant in the black-seeded than the yellow-seeded variety ofB. napus(Fig. 1). To determine which phenolic compounds accumulated in the seed coats of ZY821 and GH06, seed coats were isolated from seeds of different developmental stages and analysed using LC-UV-MS. Thirty-five phenolic compounds were detected in the flavonoid extracts from both ZY821 and GH06 seed coats. Interestingly, 13 and two compounds were unique to ZY821 and GH06, respectively (Table 1). Three types of flavonol derivatives, including quercetin, isorhamnetin, and kaempferol, and some epicatechin derivatives, were identified. Epicatechin derivatives were only detected in the seed coat extracts of ZY821 (Table 1,Fig. 2).

The concentration of epicatechin, quercetin, isorhametin, and kaempferol derivatives in the coats of ZY821 and GH06 seeds was determined (Fig. 2). It was found that the amount of all four flavonol derivatives increased during seed maturation. The total amount of flavonol derivatives peaked at 42 DAP, and declined thereafter. Epicatechin derivatives, which are reported to be an important type of flavonol in the synthesis of the seed coat ofArabidopsisandMedicago(MarinovaNone, 2007;Zhao and Dixon, 2009), were not detected in the seed coats of GH06 at any stage of seed development. Additionally, the levels of in-PAs were measured by subjecting the pellet remaining after solvent extraction directly to oxidative cleavage under hot acidic butanol. The seed coat began to accumulate in-PAs at 28 DAP (Fig. 3). A maximum level of 2.0+/-0.1 mug mg-1of seed coat (fresh weight) was detected during late seed maturation (49 DAP) (Fig. 3). The seed coats of ZY821 exhibited a much higher in-PA content than did those of GH06 (Fig. 3). In-PA content in ZY821 and GH06B. napusseed coats during seed development using BuOH-HCl assays.

The phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway is one of the most important secondary metabolism pathways in higher plants. A variety of key phytochemicals, including lignins, stilbenes, coumarins, salicylates, sinapateesters, and flavonoids, are synthesized in this pathway. InArabidopsis, several key genes in this pathway have been cloned and their functions identified (AlbertNone, 1997;NesiNone, 2000,2001;BaudryNone, 2004). Homologous genes inB. napushave also been cloned and characterized to some extent (ChenNone, 2007;WeiNone, 2007;XuNone, 2007;LuNone, 2008;AkhovNone, 2009;AugerNone, 2009). To study the expression of flavonoid genes in the seed coats of the ZY821 and GH06 varieties ofB. napus, expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences of genes involved in this biosynthetic pathway were searched for by blasting the EST sequences of the corresponding genes fromArabidopsisagainst the NCBI database. These gene sequences cloned from ZY821 and GH06 showed a high level of nucleotide similarity with phenylpropanoid and flavonoid genes from otherBrassicaspecies (Supplementary file 1atJXBonline). All currentBrassicaceaeplants are derived from the same postulatedBrassicaceaeancestry by triplicate genomes. In theB. rapagenome, the mesohexaploidy event started between 5 and 9 million years ago (WangNone, 2011). TheBrassicamesohexaploidy provides a chance to study gene retention in triplicated genomes. In fact, the substantial gene loss is typical after polyploidy formation in eukaryotes. All copies of TT genes were identified in theB. rapaandB. oleraceagenome (Supplementary Table S2atJXBonline) and each of the orthologous blocks corresponding to ancestral blocks was identified using collinearity between orthologues on the genome ofB. rapaandB. oleraceaand theA. thalianagenome (Table 2). Five copies of C4H were identified and distributed in LF, MF1, MF2, and non-genome triplication in the genome ofB. rapaandB. oleracea, respectively. However, TT7, TT3, TT12, TT8, TTG1, and TT2 were only identified in one copy in the genome ofB. rapaandB. oleracea, respectively. All copies per gene were conserved based on alignment of the DNA sequence (Suppplementary file 1). The different copies of TT genes in the B. rapa and B. oleracea genome. NoneLF indicates the least fractionated blocks. NoneMF1 indicates the medium fractionated blocks. NoneMF2 indicated the most fractionated blocks. NoneNon-genome triplication indicates that these copies are not triplicated genome segments. BnPAL, which encodes a protein that connects primary and secondary metabolism and transfers phenylalanine totrans-cinnamic acid, a precursor of other phenolic compounds (OhlNone, 1990), is a key gene in phenylpropanoid synthesis inB. napus. It was found that the expression level ofBnPALwas much higher in ZY821 than in GH06, and that expression peaked at 42 and 49 DAP, respectively (Fig. 4A). BnTT4 (BnCHS), which converts three molecules of malonyl-CoA and one molecule of 4-coumaroyl-CoA into nargingenin chalcone, catalyses the first committed step of the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway (LiNone, 1993;Shirley, 1998). All flavonoids and isoflavonoids are derived from the nargingenin chalcone generated by this first enzyme. During both early (7, 14, and 21 DAP) and late (42 and 49 DAP) development stages,BnTT4was expressed at the same level in the seed coats of ZY821 and GH06. Only during the middle development stages (28 and 35 DAP) was the expression ofBnTT4significantly higher in ZY821 than in GH06 (Fig. 4D,E). BnTT5 (BnCHI) stereospecifically directs and greatly accelerates the spontaneous cyclization of chalcones to form the flavonoid core. Since the activity of this enzyme is closely related to BnCHS activity, the gene encoding BnCHS exhibited an expression pattern similar to that ofBnTT4andBnTT5. However, the expression ofBnTT5peaked after that ofBnTT4(Fig. 4F). Moreover,BnTT6,BnTT7,BnTT3, andBnTT18had expression patterns and levels similar to those ofBnTT4andBnTT5, but they peaked at different development stages. WhereasBnTT5,BnTT6, andBnTT7expression peaked at 35 DAP (Fig. 4G,H), that ofBnTT3andBnTT18peaked only at 42 DAP (Fig. 4I,J). Furthermore, these genes were expressed at higher levels in ZY821 than in GH06. Analysis of the expression levels of genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis during seed coat development of ZY821 and GH06 by qRT-PCR (A-O). Seed coat development was divided into seven developmental stages (7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, and 49 DAP). Values represent the average +/-SD of three biological replicates with three technical replicates of each development stage. Relative gene expression levels were normalized according to the expression values of 7 in ZY821. In addition, ZY821 and GH06 contain two copies ofBnTT12, which peak at 28 DAP, and then decline. BnTT12was expressed more strongly in ZY821 than in GH06 (Fig. 4K,L). TT10encodes an enzyme that oxidizes procyanidins to yield PAs in the Arabidopsis seed coat (PourcelNone, 2005). In addition to its role in flavonoid biosynthesis,TT10also regulates lignin biosynthesis (LiangNone, 2006). The expression ofBnTT10peaks at 42 DAP (Fig. 4M). However, there was no significant difference in the expression ofBnTT10between ZY821 and GH06, except at 28 and 42 DAP. BnUGT2encodes an epicatechin-specific glucosyltransferase that is involved in the production of epicatechin 3'-O-glucoside in the seed coat (PangNone, 2008). In both ZY821 and GH06 seed coats,BnUGT2expression peaked at 35 DAP (Fig. 4N), suggesting that most anthocyanin precursors are synthesized at this stage. The visible function of anthocyanin is to promote colour formation in plant organs (SparvoliNone, 1994), which supports the hypothesis that anthocyanin accumulation plays an important role in the formation of seed coat colour inB. napusThe flavonoid pathway inArabidopsisis known to be regulated not only by structural genes, but also by regulatory genes, such asTT1,TTG1,TT2,TTG2, andTT8(WalkerNone, 1999;NesiNone, 2000,2001;JohnsonNone, 2002;SagasserNone, 2002). In this study,BnTTG1andBnTT2were found to possess a similar expression pattern and showed the highest levels of expression at 35 DAP in the seed coat of ZY821. However, the expression ofBnTT2peaked sooner in the seed coat of GH06 (Fig. 4P,Q). The expression ofBnTT8andBnTTG2was enhanced at the early stages of seed development (21 and 21 DAP), decreased during the middle stages (35 and 28 DAP), and increased again at the late stages (49 and 42 DAP) (Fig. 4O,R). During most development stages, the expression ofBnTTG1,BnTT8, andBnTTG2was stronger in ZY821 than in GH06, and the expression ofBnTT2was higher in GH06 than in ZY821 at 21 and 28 DAP. Flavonoids are secondary metabolites that accumulate in vascular plants and, to a lesser extent, in mosses. They promote seed and pollen dispersal by contributing to colour formation in fruits and flowers. Previously, researchers showed that epicatechin derivatives (MarinovaNone, 2007;Zhao and Dixon, 2009) and a PA monomer (Holton and Cornish, 1995;Grotewold, 2006) are important flavonols in the synthesis of the seed coat ofArabidopsisandMedicago. Recently, much research has focused on deciphering the genetic mechanisms underlying colour formation inB. napusseeds, and great progress has been made in this regard. However, there was no consensus on the inheritance model of the seed coat colour trait inB. napus. TheanderNone(1977)reported that the main factor contributing to seed colour is soluble anthocyanin. Subsequent research showed that the colour of immature seeds is determined by anthocyanidin, polyphenols, and flavonoid, but that the colour of mature seeds is controlled by melanin (Wang and Liu, 1996). PA accumulation contributes to the differences inB. juncea(Sharma and Dixon, 2005). InArabidopsis, PAs are synthesized as colourless polymers during the early developmental stages, and are then oxidized into brown complexes that cross-link within the cell during seed maturation. These modifications account for the typical brown colour of theArabidopsiswild-type testa (Stafford, 1988;KitamuraNone, 2004;PourcelNone, 2005). InB. napus, PAs accumulated strongly in the black-seeded line, but weakly in the yellow-seeded line. The flavonol content, however, did not differ much between these two lines (AkhovNone, 2009). In agreement with these findings,Marles and Gruber (2004)found that PA was deposited over the entire seed coat of the dark-seeded germplasm and in patches in some yellow-seeded germplasms. However, the correlation between total flavonoid content and seed colour was comparatively weak (LipsaNone, 2007). In this study, it was shown that flavonoid and its derivatives, including epicatechin, quercetin, isorhametin, and kaempferol, mainly accumulated in the black-seeded variety. In addition, 35 phenolic compounds were detected in the flavonoid extracts from both ZY821 and GH06 seed coats according to the retention time analysis of LC-UV-MS. Interestingly, 13 and two compounds could be detected only in ZY821 and GH06, respectively (Table 1). Moreover, epicatechin derivatives were not detected in the seed coat extracts of GH06 (Table 1,Fig. 2). Large differences were also found in the polyphenol composition of seed coats from the black- and yellow-seeded lines. The cytological analysis showed that polymeric phenol compounds began to accumulate in the hilum of seeds during the early developmental stages, and were mainly confined to the palisade and pigment layers of the seed coat during the middle to late stages of development. Moreover, PA and polyphenol content were higher in ZY821 than in GH06 seed coats (Fig. 1). In addition, the in-PAs were not detected during the early developmental stages ofB. napus, but accumulated during the middle to late stages, and the in-PA content of the black-seeded variety was much higher than that of the yellow-seeded line. It was also found that in-PAs accumulated in the seed coats of GH06, but did not vary much during development (Fig. 3A). The differences in in-PA content may be due to differences in the synthesis of epicatechin, as epicatechin is thought to be the major precursor of in-PAs inArabidopsisseed coats (LepiniecNone, 2006). These results suggest that the differences in seed coat colour observed inB. napusare largely attributable to differences in the content of epicatechin and its derivatives and of in-PAs. Several key genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis have been cloned and their functions identified by analysing various mutants inArabidopsis(AlbertNone, 1997;NesiNone, 2000,2001;BaudryNone, 2004;ArsovskiNone, 2010;LeNone, 2010) and other species (PangNone, 2004,2008;GallardoNone, 2007;Jiang and Deyholos, 2010). Homologous genes in theB. napuspathway have also been cloned and characterized (ChenNone, 2007;WeiNone, 2007;XuNone, 2007;LuNone, 2008;AkhovNone, 2009;AugerNone, 2009). InB. napus, BnPAL and BnC4H are the key enzymes of the phenylpropanoid pathway, which synthesizes primary and secondary metabolites and converts phenylalanine intotrans-cinnamic acid, which is a precursor of other phenolic compounds (OhlNone, 1990). Blount and co-workers reported that PAL activity was reduced by the antisense-mediated silencing ofC4H, and concluded thatC4Hwas involved in regulating the expression ofPAL(BlountNone, 2000). In a previous study, using three pairs of near isogenic lines ofB. napus, it was found that the enzyme activity of BnPAL was much higher in the black-seeded lines than in the yellow-seeded lines, and differed significantly among the lines. Moreover, it was found that cinnamic acid accumulated robustly andp-coumaric acid weakly in the young seed coats of yellow-seeded lines, but conversely during the middle to late stages of seed development (Liang and Li, 2004). In this study, the expression level ofBnPALin ZY821 was found to be much higher than in GH06, and expression in ZY821 was strongest at 42 DAP, which was also 7 d earlier than in GH06 (Fig. 4A). These results are consistent with the PAL activity and expression inB. napus, and confirm that the activity of BnPAL is closely related to the expression pattern ofBnPAL. Furthermore, the expression level ofBnC4Hwas much higher in ZY821 than in GH06 during the middle developmental stages, and the expression ofBnC4Hpeaked 7 d before that ofBnPAL(Fig. 4A-C). This result supports the hypothesis that flux into the phenylpropanoid pathway is controlled, at least in part, by feedback regulation of PAL sensed through the production of cinnamic acid (BlountNone, 2000). In addition, it also confirmed the previous results that showed that cinnamic acid accumulated robustly andp-coumaric acid weakly in the young seed coats of yellow-seeded lines, but conversely during the middle to late stages of seed development (Liang and Li, 2004). UGT2encodes an epicatechin-specific glucosyltransferase involved in the production of epicatechin 3'-O-glucoside in the seed coat (PangNone, 2008). TT12is an ABC transporter that is responsible for epicatechin 3'-O-glucoside and anthocyanin cyanidin-3-O-glucoside uptake inMedicagoandArabidopsis, respectively (DebeaujonNone, 2001;MarinovaNone, 2007;ChaiNone, 2009;Zhao and Dixon, 2009). Moreover, ANR converts cyanidin into epicatechin. Epicatechin is one of the precursors for biosynthesis of PA (AlbertNone, 1997;DevicNone, 1999;XieNone, 2003;BaudryNone, 2004). In this study, the expression ofBnUGT2andBnTT12was found to be higher in ZY821 than in GH06; however, both genes were expressed throughout the development of GH06 seed coats (Fig. 4N,K,L). This result also indicates that epicatechin, which was not detected at any stage of seed coat development in GH06, contributes to seed coat colour formation (Fig. 2). It was shown here that the expression of genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis varied throughout seed development, and that the genes had different expression patterns in the black- and yellow-seeded lines. The genes were classified according to the time at which their expression peaked. The expression of the first group of genes, includingBnTT4,BnTT8, andBnTT12, peaked at the early stages of seed development in black-seeded ZY821. Another group of genes (BnC4H,BnTT5,BnTT6,BnTT7,BnUGT2 BnPAL,BnTT3,BnTT18, andBnTT10) showed the highest expression levels at 35 and 42 DAP, respectively. Thus, these genes could play important roles in flavonoid biosynthesis during the middle to late stages of seed coat development (Fig. 4). In addition,BnTT6,BnTT7,BnTT3, andBnTT18exhibited similar expression patterns between the black- and yellow-seeded varieties ofB. napus. In contrast, the expression ofBnTT7,BnTT18, andBnTT10peaked earlier in GH06 than in ZY821 (Fig. 4H,J,M). Furthermore, there were no significant differences in the expression level ofBnPAL,BnC4H,BnTT4, andBnTT6between the different stages of seed development in GH06. The differences in the expression patterns of genes revealed genetic differences in the synthesis of pigments between the black- and yellow-seeded varieties ofB. napus. These results suggested thatBnPAL,BnC4H,BnTT4, andBnTT6are the key genes underlying differences in seed coat pigmentation inB. napus, and that the expression of these genes may be inhibited in the yellow-seeded line ofB. napus. The inheritance of seed coat colour inB. napusis quite complicated, and the regulatory mechanisms underlying the biosynthesis of the relevant genes were hitherto unknown. In this study, the expression level of genes involved in pigment biosynthesis was found to vary greatly between the yellow- and black-seeded lines ofB. napus. However, all of these genes were also expressed in the yellow-seeded lines. These data indicate that the absence of pigment synthesis in the yellow-seeded line ofB. napusinvolves the down-regulation, but not the complete inactivation, of several key genes. In addition, the seed coat colour ofB. napuswas affected by environmental factors, such as temperature and light (DeynzeNone, 1993). Future research should aim to decipher the mechanisms that down-regulate the expression of genes involved in pigment synthesis in yellow-seededB. napus. For the reasons mentioned above, this study has almost certainly analysed the metabolic networks underlying pigment formation, investigated the laws of variation in the accumulation of flavonol and phenolic compounds using histochemical and LC-UV-MS methods, and monitored the differential expression of the main structural genes and transcription factors involved in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway (Fig. 5). The findings illuminate the mechanisms underlying colour formation inB. napusseed coats. Proposed model for the molecular mechanisms underlying seed coat colour inB. napus.
