Serine, cysteine and metalloproteases can signal to cells by cleaving protease-activated receptors (PARs), a family of four G-protein coupled receptors (PAR1-4) (Ossovskaya and Bunnett,2004; Hollenberget al.,2014; Zhaoet al.,2014b). PAR2 is expressed by epithelial, endothelial and smooth muscle cells, as well as by cells of the immune and nervous systems (Nystedtet al.,1995,1994; Bohmet al.,1996). Proteases that activate PAR2 in primary sensory neurons stimulate the release of substance P and CGRP in peripheral tissues, leading to neurogenic inflammation (Steinhoffet al.,2000). PAR2 can also sensitize and activate transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels in primary sensory neurons, including TRP vanilloid 1 and 4 (TRPV1 and TRPV4) and ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) (Amadesiet al.,2004; Daiet al.,2007; Grantet al.,2007), which results in central transmission, neuropeptide release in the spinal cord and nociceptive transmission (Vergnolleet al.,2001). Proteases that activate PAR2 on epithelial cells can promote disassembly of tight junctions (Jacobet al.,2005), induce cyclooxygenase 2 (Wanget al.,2008) and stimulate release of proinflammatory cytokines (Wanget al.,2010). PAR2 deletion ameliorates inflammatory and painful disorders of the airways, joints, colon and skin (Lindneret al.,2000; Schmidlinet al.,2002; Ferrellet al.,2003; Shichijoet al.,2006; Cottrellet al.,2007; Cattaruzzaet al.,2011). These observations suggest that PAR2 is an important target for inflammatory and painful disorders. However, the development of therapeutically useful antagonists has been hampered by the unusual mechanism of PAR2 auto-activation. The canonical mechanism by which trypsin and mast cell tryptase activate PAR2 involves hydrolysis of Arg36?Ser37and exposure of the tethered ligand S37LIGKV- (human PAR2), which binds to and activates the cleaved receptor (Nystedtet al.,1994; Bohmet al.,1996). Synthetic peptides that mimic the tethered ligand can directly activate PAR2 and are useful tools to probe receptor function. Trypsin-activated PAR2 couples to Galphaqand phospholipase Cbeta, leading to mobilization of intracellular calcium and activation of PKC and D (Amadesiet al.,2006; Amadesiet al.,2009). Trypsin-activated PAR2 also recruits G protein receptor kinase 2 and beta-arrestins, which mediate PAR2 endocytosis and ERK1/2 signalling from endosomes (Deryet al.,1999; DeFeaet al.,2000; Ayoub and Pin,2013; Jensenet al.,2013). The development of PAR2 antagonists is complicated by this mechanism of intramolecular receptor activation by a proteolytically exposed tethered ligand. Another complication is the existence of divergent mechanisms of proteolytic activation (Hollenberget al.,2014; Zhaoet al.,2014b). Proteases that cleave PAR2 distal to the canonical cleavage site can disarm the receptor by removing the trypsin-activation site. For example, neutrophil/leukocyte elastase cleaves PAR2 at Ser67?Val68, which removes the trypsin cleavage site and thereby blocks the capacity of trypsin to activate the receptor (Dulonet al.,2003). However, proteases that cleave PAR2 at different sites within theN-terminal domain can create different tethered ligands or stabilize unique receptor conformations and thereby can act as biased agonists that promote PAR2 coupling to divergent signalling pathways. Cathepsin-S, a cysteine protease secreted by antigen-presenting cells, cleaves PAR2 at Glu56?Thr57, to reveal a different tethered ligand that promotes PAR2 coupling to Galphas, adenylyl cyclase, cAMP and PKA, but not to Galphaqand beta-arrestins (Zhaoet al.,2014a). Cathepsin-S can also cleave PAR2 at Gly41?Lys42(Elmariahet al.,2014). Elastase is also a biased agonist that promotes PAR2 coupling to Galphas, adenylyl cyclase, cAMP and PKA, but not to Galphaqand beta-arrestins, although elastase does not activate PAR2 by a tethered ligand mechanism (Ramachandranet al.,2011; Zhaoet al.,2015). Despite these divergent mechanisms of PAR2 activation, both canonical and biased protease agonists cause PAR2- and TRPV4-dependent inflammation and pain (Grantet al.,2007; Pooleet al.,2013; Zhaoet al.,2014a,2015). Thus, therapeutically useful antagonists may need to disrupt the capacity of diverse proteases to activate PAR2 at different sites by canonical and biased mechanisms. Although antibodies that target the canonical PAR2 cleavage site have efficacy in preclinical models of inflammatory disease (Kelsoet al.,2006; Yauet al.,2013), it is uncertain whether they can block activation of the receptor by biased proteases that cleave at distant sites. The small molecule PAR2 antagonist ENMD-1068 and peptidomimetic antagonists based on the canonical tethered ligand domain, including K-14585 and C391, can also inhibit PAR2-mediated inflammation and pain, but their ability to suppress biased mechanisms of PAR2 activation has not been reported (Kelsoet al.,2006; Gohet al.,2009; Yauet al.,2013; Boitanoet al.,2015). GB83 and GB88 are small molecules that can inhibit PAR2 activation by trypsin, tryptase and tethered ligand-derived agonists and are efficacious in preclinical models of inflammatory diseases (Barryet al.,2010; Suenet al.,2012; Lohmanet al.,2012a,2012b). However, it has not yet been reported whether GB88 can antagonize the actions of canonical and biased agonists of PAR2 on nociceptor activity and nociception. We examined the effects of GB88 on the capacity of canonical and biased proteases to activate rodent nociceptors and induce pain and inflammation. Animal studies are reported in compliance with the ARRIVE guidelines (Kilkennyet al.,2010; McGrath Lilley,2015).The Animal Ethics Committee of Monash University approved procedures using animals. Male C57BL/6,par2Noneandpar2Nonemice littermates (Lindneret al.,2000) (8-12 weeks-old), and male Sprague Dawley rats (7-8 weeks-old) were studied. Animals were maintained under temperature (22 +/- 4 degrees C) and light-controlled (12 h light/dark cycle) conditions with free access to food and water. Mice were placed in individual cylinders on a mesh stand. They were acclimatized to the experimental room, restraint apparatus and investigator for 2 h periods on two successive days before experiments. To assess mechanical pain, paw withdrawal in response to stimulation of the plantar surface of the hindpaw with graded von Frey filaments (0.078, 0.196, 0.392, 0.686, 1.569, 3.922, 5.882, 9.804, 13.725 and 19.608 mN) was determined using the 'up-and-down' paradigm (Chaplanet al.,1994). In this analysis, an increase in the filament stiffness required to induce paw withdrawal indicates mechanical analgesia, whereas a decrease in the filament stiffness required to induce withdrawal indicates mechanical hyperalgesia. On the day before the study, von Frey scores were measured in triplicate to establish a baseline for each animal. To assess inflammatory oedema of the paw, hind paw thickness was measured using digital callipers before and after treatments (Zhaoet al.,2014a,2015). For studies of thermal hyperalgesia, paw withdrawal latencies to thermal stimulation of the plantar surface of the hind paw were measured in unrestrained mice using Hargreaves' apparatus (Amadesiet al.,2006). Mice were placed in plastic chambers on a glass surface (25 degrees C) and acclimatized for 1 h before baseline readings were collected. A radiant heat source was applied to the hind paw, and latency of the paw withdrawal was taken as the average of three trials per animal. A cut-off latency was set at 20 s to avoid tissue damage. In this analysis, an increase in latency indicates thermal analgesia, whereas a decrease in latency indicates thermal hyperalgesia. Investigators were blinded to the experimental treatments. GB88 (10 mg.kg-1in olive oil) or vehicle (control and olive oil) was administered by gavage (150 muL) 2 h before intraplantar injections. For intraplantar injections, mice were sedated with 5% isoflurane. Trypsin (140 nM, 0.04 U.muL-1), elastase (1.18 muM, 0.03 U.muL-1), cathepsin-S (2.5 muM, 0.06 U.muL-1), 2-furoyl-LIGRLO-NH2(64 muM, 50 ng.muL-1), AC264613 (250 muM, 100 ng.muL-1), capsaicin (1.6 muM, 0.5 ng.muL-1) or vehicle (0.9% NaCl) was injected s.c. into the plantar surface of the left hind paw (10 muL). Mechanical hyperalgesia, paw thickness and thermal hyperalgesia were measured hourly for 4 h.cDNAs for mouse and rat PAR2 were amplified by using RNA from mouse or rat colon. The following forward and reverse primers were used: mouse PAR2, CACCGGGACGCAACAACAGTAAAG (mPar2_F199) andGAATTCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGATATGCAGCTGTTGAGGGTCGACAG (mPar2_R1136_T7); rat PAR2, GAATGCACCGGGACCCAACAGTAA (rPAR2_F165) andGAATTCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGATGGAGGTGAGCGATATCTGCATGC (rPAR2_R1216_T7). The design of the reverse primers included the T7 promoter sequence (underlined), which allowed the PCR products to be used directly for the generation of digoxigenin (DIG)-labelled antisense cRNA probes byin vitrotranscription with T7 RNA polymerase (Roche Products, Dee Why, NSW, Australia). Sections (12 mum) of mouse and rat dorsal root ganglia (DRG, lumbar) or trigeminal ganglia were processed for combinedin situhybridization and immunofluorescence as described previously (Bronet al.,2014; Lieuet al.,2014). The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit anti-CGRP (Sigma #C8198; 1:2000), mouse anti-heavy chain neurofilament (NF200, Sigma; #N0142; 1000). Biotinylated isolectin B4 (IB4) was from Sigma (#L2140). Secondary antibodies used were donkey anti-mouse-Alexa-488 (1:500), donkey anti-rabbit-Alexa568 (1:1000) and streptavidin-Alexa647 (1:500) (Thermofisher Scientific, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Sections were imaged using 10* or 20* objective magnification on a Zeiss Axioskope.Z1 fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Oberkocken, Germany). Images were processed using the Zeiss Zen software and exported as TIFF files to Adobe Photoshop for figure preparation. DRG were collected from Sprague Dawley rats. Neurons were dispersed as described previously with modifications (Zhaoet al.,2014a;2015). Briefly, DRG from all levels were incubated with collagenase IV (2 mg.mL-1), dispase II (2 mg.mL-1) and DNase I (100 mug.mL-1) for 40 min at 37 degrees C. Cells were centrifuged (500 g, 5 min), re-suspended in HBSS and filtered through a 40 mum nylon mesh. Filtered cells were centrifuged, re-suspended in 1 mL of HBSS and layered onto a 20% Percoll gradient in Leibovitz's L-15 medium. The gradient was centrifuged (800 g, 9 min). The supernatant was removed, and the cell pellet was washed with L-15 medium. Neurons were placed in 96 well plates coated with laminin (0.004 mg.mL-1) and poly-l-lysine (0.1 mg.mL-1). Neurons were cultured in L-15 medium containing 10% FCS, with penicillin and streptomycin for 16 h at 37 degrees C.Neurons were loaded with Fura2-AM (2 muM, 1.5 h, 37 degrees C). Neurons were incubated in calcium buffer (150 mM NaCl, 2.6 mM KCl, 0.1 mM CaCl2, 1.18 mM MgCl2, 10 mM D-glucose, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) at 37 degrees C on the stage of a Leica DMI6000B microscope equipped with a PL APO * 20 NA 0.75 objective (Leica Microsystems, North Ryde, NSW, Australia). Fluorescence was measured at 340 and 380 nm excitation with 530 nm emission using an Andor iXon 887 camera (Andor Technology, Belfast, UK) andmetafluorversion 7.8.0 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) (Zhaoet al.,2014a; Zhaoet al.,2015). Neurons were challenged sequentially with trypsin (10 nM, 2.85 mU.muL-1), elastase (100 nM, 2.54 mU.muL-1) or cathepsin-S (100 nM, 2.4 mU.muL-1), followed by capsaicin (1 muM) and KCl (50 mM). In some experiments, neurons were incubated with GB88 (10 muM) or vehicle (control) (30 min pre-incubation and inclusion throughout). Images were analysed using a custom journal inmetamorphsoftware version 7.8.2 (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). A maximum intensity image was generated and projected through time to generate an image of all cells. Cells were segmented and binarized from this image using the Multi Wavelength Cell Scoring module on the basis of size and fluorescence intensity. Neurons of interest ( less than 25 mum diameter) were selected. Results are expressed as the proportion of capsaicin- and KCl-responsive neurons that also responded to proteases. GB88 (10 muM) was pre-incubated with the appropriate fluorogenic substrate (50 muM): trypsin, H-D-Ala-Leu-Lys-AMC; elastase, MeOSuc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-AMC, cathepsin-S: Boc-Val-Leu-Lys-AMC. Proteases were added to give final concentrations of 10 nM trypsin, 100 nM elastase or 100 nM cathepsin-S. Substrate cleavage was assessed by measuring fluorescence during the initial 60-120 s (ex/em 360/440 nm). The slope was determined in the linear range and presented as % of the control. Recombinant proteases (100 ng) were diluted in 20 muL PBS containing GB88 (0, 1 or 10 muM) and DMSO (1%) and were incubated for 30 min at 37 degrees C. The appropriate activity-based probes were added: trypsin, PK-DPP (1 muM); elastase, V-DPP (1 muM), cathepsin-S, BMV109 (100 nM) (Panet al.,2006; Gilmoreet al.,2009; Verdoeset al.,2013). Proteases were incubated with activity-based probes for 5 min at 37 degrees C, solubilized with sample buffer, boiled and separated on a 15% SDS-PAGE gel. Probe labelling was detected by scanning gels for Cy5 fluorescence using a Typhoon FLA 7000 Scanner (GE Healthcare, Parramatta, NSW, Australia). The data and statistical analysis comply with the recommendations on experimental design and analysis in pharmacology (Curtiset al.,2015). Results are expressed as mean +/- SEM. Data were analysed ingraphpadprism6.0 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA) using Student'st-test or ANOVA followed by Dunnett'spost hoctest. Post hoctests were used only ifFachievedP less than 0.05 and there was no significant variance in homogeneity. Differences between means with aP-value less than 0.05 were considered significant at the 95% confidence level. GB88 (N-[(2S)-3-cyclohexyl-1-[[(2S,3R)-3-methyl-1-oxo-1-spiro[indene-1,4'-piperidine]-1'-ylpentan-2-yl]amino]-1-oxopropan-2-yl]-1,2-oxazole-5-carboxamide) was prepared as described previously (Barryet al.,2010; Suenet al.,2012). The PAR2 agonists 2-furoyl-LIGRLO-NH2was from American Peptide Company Inc. (Sunnyvale, CA, USA) and AC264613 was from Tocris Biosciences (Bristol, UK). Human pancreatic trypsin (100 000 U.mL-1) was from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Human cathepsin-S (0.4 U.mL-1) was a gift from Medivir AB (Huddinge, Sweden) and has been described previously (Zhaoet al.,2014a). Human sputum elastase (864 U.mg-1) was from Elastin Products Company (Owensville, MO, USA). Fluorogenic protease substrates were from Bachem AG (Budendorf, Switzerland): trypsin, H-D-Ala-Leu-Lys-AMC; elastase, MeOSuc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-AMC; cathepsin-S, Bock-Val-Leu-Lys-AMC. The activity-based protease probes Cy5-ProLys-diphenyl phosphonate (PK-DPP), Cy5-Val-diphenyl phosphonate (V-DPP) and BMV109 were synthesized as described previously (Panet al.,2006; Gilmoreet al.,2009; Verdoeset al.,2013). Unless otherwise indicated, other reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Proteases that cleave PAR2 at different sites within the extracellularN-terminal domain can activate canonical or biased signalling pathways (Hollenberget al.,2014; Zhaoet al.,2014b). Although PAR2 deletion attenuates the pronociceptive and proinflammatory actions of trypsin, tryptase, elastase and cathepsin-S (Vergnolleet al.,2001; Zhaoet al.,2014a; Zhaoet al.,2015), a pharmacological inhibitor of pain and inflammation induced by biased protease agonists of PAR2 has not been identified. We evaluated whether GB88 inhibits trypsin-, elastase- and cathepsin-S-evoked inflammation and nociception in mice. Intraplantar injection of trypsin stimulated a 12% increase in paw thickness within 1 h that was sustained for 4 h, indicative of oedema (Figure 1A). Trypsin caused a significant reduction in von Frey responses between 2-4 h, consistent with mechanical hyperalgesia (Figure 1B), and decreased the latency of paw withdrawal to heat from 3 to 4 h, indicating thermal hyperalgesia (Figure 1C). P.o. administration of GB88 (10 mg.kg-1) 2 h before injection of trypsin reduced the effects of trypsin on paw thickness by ~50% and prevented trypsin-induced mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia (Figure 1A-C). Effects of GB88 on protease-evoked inflammation and nociception. Mice were treated with GB88 (10 mg.kg-1p.o.) or vehicle 2 h before intraplantar injections of trypsin (A-C; 30 ng), cathepsin-S (Cat-S, D-F; 14 mug), elastase (G-I; 290 ng) or vehicle. Paw thickness (A, D and G), paw withdrawal to mechanical stimulation (B, E and H) and paw withdrawal to thermal stimulation (C, F and I) were measured. *P less than 0.05 compared with vehicle/vehicle control. Variablenindicates mouse number. Intraplantar injection of cathepsin-S caused a 16% increase in paw thickness within 1 h, which was sustained for 4 h (Figure 1D). Cathepsin-S reduced the von Frey response from 1 to 4 h (Figure 1E) and decreased latency time to paw withdrawal from heat at 2-4 h (Figure 1F). GB88 abolished cathepsin-S-induced oedema and attenuated cathepsin-S-stimulated mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia (Figure 1D-F). Intraplantar injection of elastase caused a 9% increase in paw thickness at 1 h that was sustained for 4 h (Figure 1G). Elastase reduced the von Frey response from 2 to 3 h, consistent with mechanical hyperalgesia (Figure 1H). In contrast to trypsin and cathepsin-S, elastase did not cause significant thermal hyperalgesia (Figure 1I). GB88 attenuated elastase-induced oedema and mechanical hyperalgesia (Figure 1G-I). Intraplantar injection of vehicle did not induce oedema or mechanical hypersensitivity, and GB88 did not affect baseline paw thickness (Figure 2A) or mechanical sensitivity (Figure 2B). Effects of GB88 on basal inflammation and nociception. Mice were treated with GB88 (10 mg.kg-1p.o.) or vehicle 2 h before intraplantar injection of vehicle. Paw thickness (A) and paw withdrawal to mechanical stimulation (B) were measured hourly for 4 h. Variablenindicates mouse number. Thus, GB88 inhibits the proinflammatory and pronociceptive actions of proteases that activate PAR2 by canonical and biased mechanisms. Synthetic peptides that mimic the trypsin-exposed tethered ligand can directly activate PAR2. Like trypsin, these activating peptides induce PAR2 coupling to Galphaqand beta-arrestins, sensitize TRP channels, and cause inflammation and pain (Amadesiet al.,2004; Daiet al.,2004; Grantet al.,2007). We investigated whether GB88 inhibited the proinflammatory and pronociceptive actions of 2-furoyl-LIGRLO-NH2, an analogue of the tethered ligand domain (Kankeet al.,2005), and AC264613, a small molecule agonist of PAR2 that elicits thermal hyperalgesia and oedema (Gardellet al.,2008). Intraplantar injection of 2-furoyl-LIGRLO-NH2caused a 21% increase in paw thickness at 1 h, which was sustained for 4 h (Figure 3A). 2-furoyl-LIGRLO-NH2reduced the von Frey withdrawal response from 2 to 4 h, indicative of mechanical hyperalgesia (Figure 3B). GB88 inhibited oedema induced by 2-furoyl-LIGRLO-NH2and reduced mechanical hyperalgesia by 30% (Figure 3A, B). Intraplantar injection of AC264613 induced a 10% increase in paw thickness at 1 h that persisted for 4 h (Figure 3C). AC264613 also evoked a robust mechanical hyperalgesia from 1 to 4 h (Figure 3D). GB88 prevented the proinflammatory and pronociceptive effects of AC264613 (Figure 3C, D). Thus, GB88 inhibits mouse paw inflammation and nociception caused by small molecule synthetic agonists of PAR2. Effects of GB88 on PAR2 agonist-evoked inflammation and nociception. Mice were treated with GB88 (10 mg.kg-1p.o.) or vehicle 2 h before intraplantar injections of 2-furoyl-LIGRLO-NH2(2F) (A and B; 500 ng) or AC264613 (C and D; 1 mug). Paw thickness (A and C) and paw withdrawal to mechanical stimulation (B and D) were measured hourly for 4 h. *P less than 0.05 compared with vehicle/vehicle control. Variablenindicates mouse number. The capacity of GB88 to inhibit protease- and PAR2-evoked inflammation and nociception could be due to antagonism of PAR2 or downstream mediators, such as TRP channels. TRPV1 is a downstream target of PAR2 that contributes to the effects of proteases on inflammation and nociception (Amadesiet al.,2004). Capsaicin directly activates TRPV1 on primary sensory neurons to cause neurogenic inflammation and nociception (Caterinaet al.,1997). We examined whether GB88 affected capsaicin-induced inflammation and nociception. Intraplantar injection of capsaicin evoked a 55% increase in paw thickness within 1 h that persisted for 4 h (Figure 4A). Capsaicin also induced a robust mechanical hyperalgesia at 1 h that was sustained for 4 h (Figure 4B). GB88 had no effect on capsaicin-stimulated oedema and mechanical hyperalgesia (Figure 4A, B). Thus, the anti-inflammatory and analgesic actions of GB88 are not due to antagonism of TRPV1, because the proinflammatory and nociceptive effects of capsaicin were unaffected. Effects of GB88 on capsaicin-evoked inflammation and nociception. Mice were treated with GB88 (10 mg.kg-1p.o.) or vehicle 2 h before intraplantar injection of capsaicin (Cap, 5 mug). Paw thickness (A) and paw withdrawal to mechanical stimulation (B) were measured hourly for 4 h. *P less than 0.05 compared with vehicle/Cat-S control. Variablenindicates mouse number. Deletion ofparNoneattenuates the capacity of trypsin, cathepsin-S and elastase to induce oedema and hyperalgesia (Vergnolleet al.,2001; Zhaoet al.,2014a; Zhaoet al.,2015). BecauseparNonedeletion does not completely inhibit cathepsin-S-induced inflammation and nociception (Zhaoet al.,2014a), we examined whether GB88 had residual actions inparNoneNonemice, consistent with PAR2-independent effects. In wild-type mice, cathepsin-S evoked a 19% increase in paw thickness (Figure 5A) and a sustained mechanical hyperalgesia (Figure 5B). GB88 inhibited cathepsin-S-induced oedema and hyperalgesia. ParNonedeletion also inhibited cathepsin-S-induced oedema and hyperalgesia, and GB88 had no additional inhibitory actions inparNoneNonemice. The inability of GB88 to exert additional anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive effects inparNoneNonemice suggests that the actions of GB88 are mediated by antagonism of PAR2. Effects of GB88 on inflammation and nociception in PAR2 deficient mice. Par2None(wild-type, WT) orpar2None(knockout, KO) mice were treated with GB88 (10 mg.kg-1p.o.) or vehicle 2 h before intraplantar injection of Cat-S (14 mug). Paw thickness (A) and paw withdrawal to mechanical stimulation (B) were measured hourly for 4 h. *P less than 0.05 compared with vehicle/vehicle control. Variablenindicates mouse number. Proteases can induce neurogenic inflammation and nociception directly by activating PAR2 on primary sensory neurons (Steinhoffet al.,2000) or indirectly by releasing stimulants from keratinocytes, which express high levels of PAR2 (Steinhoffet al.,1999). We usedin situhybridization to examine the expression of PAR2 mRNA by primary sensory neurons in dorsal root and trigeminal ganglia of rat and mouse. In mice, PAR2 was detected at low levels in DRG neurons (data not shown), but was more prominently expressed in trigeminal neurons (Figure 6A). In rats, PAR2 mRNA was readily detected in DRG neurons (Figure 6B, C). PAR2-positive neurons were of small diameter and included peptidergic neurons expressing immunoreactive CGRP and non-peptidergic neurons that bound IB4 (Figure 6C-G). PAR2-positive neurons did not express NF200, a marker for large diameter neurons. Thus, PAR2 mRNA is abundantly expressed in rat nociceptors. Localization of PAR2 mRNA in DRG. In situhybridization on sections of mouse trigeminal ganglia (A) or rat DRG (B). (C-G) The inset shows an inverted image of PAR2in situhybridization (ISH; C), immunoreactive CGRP (D), immunoreactive neurofilament 200 (NF200; E), IB4 (F) and a merged image (G). Arrowheads show expression of PAR2 in small diameter neurons that expressed CGRP or bound IB4. Scale is 20 mum. To determine whether GB88 can attenuate nociceptor activation by proteases that are canonical and biased agonists of PAR2, we examined protease-induced Ca2+signalling in DRG neurons. We studied neurons from rats, rather than mice, due to the higher expression of PAR2 mRNA in rat nociceptors (Figure 6) and because PAR2 agonists generated larger signals in a higher proportion of DRG neurons from rats than mice (not shown). We have previously reported that canonical (trypsin, tryptase) and biased (cathepsin-S, elastase) proteolytic activators can induce PAR2-dependent Ca2+signals in DRG neurons (Steinhoffet al.,2000; Zhaoet al.,2014a;2015). Whereas canonical proteases evoke PAR2 coupling to Galphaq, and mobilization of intracellular Ca2+, cathepsin-S- and elastase-activated PAR2 does not couple to Galphaq, and instead causes Galphas-, adenylyl cyclase- and PKA-mediated activation of TRPV4, which permits influx of Ca2+ions from the extracellular fluid (Zhaoet al.,2014a,2015). Trypsin induced a rapid but transient increase in [Ca2+]ithat was maximal at 2 min and returned to baseline after 5 min, consistent with mobilization of Ca2+ions from intracellular stores (Figure 7A). Cathepsin-S and elastase caused a gradual and sustained increase in [Ca2+]ithat was maintained for at least 5 min, consistent with activation of TRPV4 and influx of extracellular Ca2+ions (Figure 7C, F). GB88 markedly inhibited the magnitude of responses to trypsin, cathepsin-S and elastase. Of all the capsaicin- and KCl-responsive neurons, 52 +/- 5% responded to trypsin, 49 +/- 7% responded to cathepsin-S and 57 +/- 10% responded to elastase. GB88 reduced the proportion of responsive neurons by greater than 60% (Figure 7G). In contrast, GB88 neither affected the magnitude of the Ca2+response to capsaicin nor the proportion of capsaicin-responsive neurons, consistent with its inability to inhibit capsaicin-evoked inflammation and nociception. The results suggest that GB88 inhibits proteolytic activation of nociceptive neurons, which has been shown to depend in a large part on PAR2 (Zhaoet al.,2014a,2015). Effects of GB88 on protease-induced Ca2+signalling in DRG neurons. Rat DRG neurons were challenged with trypsin (A and B; 10 nM), elastase (C and D; 100 nM) or Cat-S (E and F; 100 nM) in the presence of GB88 (10 muM) or vehicle (control). (A, C and E) Representative traces of kinetics of Ca2+responses. (B, D and F) AUC from 50 to 250 s. (G) Effects of GB88 on the proportion of protease-responsive neurons that also responded to capsaicin. *P less than 0.05;n = 4-6 rats, greater than 100 neurons analysed from each rat. To eliminate the possibility that the anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive effects of GB88 were mediated by protease inhibition rather than PAR2 antagonism, we studied the ability of GB88 to prevent proteolytic activity. Using fluorogenic substrates, we monitored the activity of recombinant proteases upon initial interaction with GB88, mimicking the conditions that were used in the studies of DRG neurons. GB88 (1 or 10 muM) did not affect the activity of trypsin, elastase of cathepsin-S (Figure 8A). We also tested the ability of GB88 to inhibit the covalent binding of proteases to activity-based probes. In this assay, GB88 was incubated with the enzyme for 30 min. Trypsin activity was not affected at any concentration of GB88 tested (1, 10 muM) (Figure 8B, C). Cathepsin-S and elastase activities were modestly affected at 10 muM ( less than 25% inhibition). Hence, GB88 can directly inhibit proteases activity, but only at high concentrations that are unlikely to be achievedin vivo. Thus, the effects of GB88 on nociceptor activation, inflammation and nociception are unlikely to be due to direct effects on protease activity, but rather through antagonism of PAR2. Effects of GB88 on protease activity. (A) Effects of GB88 on protease cleavage of fluorogenic substrates. GB88 (10 muM) was mixed with substrates (50 muM). Proteases were added (final concentrations: trypsin, 10 nM; Cat-S, 100 nM; elastase, 100 nM), and fluorescence was monitored. The slope of the reaction was measured during the initial 60-120 s (in the linear range). (B and C) Effects of GB88 on protease labelling by fluorescent activity-based probes. Recombinant proteases were pretreated with GB88 (1, 10 muM) in 1% DMSO. Residual activity was determined by labelling with activity-based probes and analysis by fluorescent SDS-PAGE.

GB88 inhibited the proinflammatory and pronociceptive actions of proteases that are either canonical or biased agonists of PAR2. Trypsin, cathepsin-S and elastase exert proinflammatory and pronociceptive effects that are attenuated bypar2deletion (Vergnolleet al.,2001; Zhaoet al.,2014a; Zhaoet al.,2015). However, these proteases all cleave PAR2 at different sites and induce receptor coupling to distinct G proteins and signalling pathways. Trypsin causes PKC- and PKA-dependent sensitization of TRP channels and nociceptors, whereas cathepsin-S and elastase activate TRP channels and nociceptors solelyviaPKA (Amadesiet al.,2006; Zhaoet al.,2014a; Zhaoet al.,2015). Despite these differences, we found that GB88 inhibited the proinflammatory and pronociceptive actions of trypsin, cathepsin-S and elastase, consistent with the observation thatParNonedeletion inhibits trypsin-, cathepsin-S- and elastase-induced inflammation and nociception (Vergnolleet al.,2001; Zhaoet al.,2014a; Zhaoet al.,2015). GB88 did not affect capsaicin-evoked and TRPV1-mediated inflammation and nociception and had no additional anti-inflammatory or antinociceptive actions inpar2-deficient mice, consistent with PAR2 being the primary target of GB88in vivo. GB88 inhibited the proinflammatory and pronociceptive actions of the synthetic PAR2 agonists 2-furoyl-LIGRLO-NH2and AC264613. 2-furoyl-LIGRLO-NH2and AC264613 are selective for PAR2 over other PARs and induce oedema and hyperalgesia after intraplantar injection to mice (Kankeet al.,2005; Gardellet al.,2008; Suenet al.,2012). These results are consistent with GB88 inhibiting protease-induced inflammation and pain and support the view that GB88 exerts anti-inflammatory and analgesic actions by antagonism of PAR2. Trypsin, cathepsin-S and elastase each caused a sustained paw oedema and mechanical hyperalgesia in mice. Trypsin and cathepsin-S, but not elastase, also caused thermal hyperalgesia. The reason for the differences in the tendency of proteases to cause thermal hyperalgesia is unknown, but may relate to the activation of different signalling processes that differentially sensitize thermo-sensitive TRP channels. Although trypsin, cathepsin-S and elastase induced PAR2-dependent activation of TRPV4 (Zhaoet al.,2014a; Zhaoet al.,2015), trypsin can also sensitize TRPV1 and TRPA1 (Amadesiet al.,2004; Daiet al.,2007). Further studies are required to ascertain whether cathepsin-S and elastase can sensitize TRPV1 and TRPA1. GB88 blocked the capacity of trypsin, cathepsin-S and elastase to activate nociceptors. DRG neurons expressing PAR2 mRNA were of small diameter and included peptidergic and non-peptidergic neurons with the characteristics of nociceptors. Our findings support other reports of prominent expression of PARs by nociceptors (Steinhoffet al.,2000; Vellaniet al.,2010). Consistent with these findings, trypsin, cathepsin-S and elastase induced robust increases in [Ca2+]iin a substantial proportion of small diameter, capsaicin-sensitive rat DRG neurons. Whereas trypsin stimulated a rapid and transient increase in [Ca2+]i, consistent with mobilization of intracellular calcium stores, cathepsin-S and elastase induced a gradual and sustained increase in [Ca2+]i, which suggests activation of a plasma membrane channel and influx of extracellular Ca2+ions. Regardless of the mechanism, GB88 inhibited the magnitude of protease-evoked signals and the proportion of neurons with detectable responses. Thus, PAR2 is a prominent mediator of protease signalling to nociceptive neurons. Residual responses in GB88-treated neurons may be attributed to activation of other receptors or channels. Elastase can also activate PAR1, and cathepsin-S activates MrgprC11, which are expressed in nociceptors (Vellaniet al.,2010; Miharaet al.,2013; Reddyet al.,2015). GB88 can antagonize mouse, rat and human PAR2, consistent with the high degree of PAR2 homology in these species (Ossovskaya and Bunnett,2004). We observed that GB88 antagonizes mouse and rat PAR2, in agreement with reports that GB88 inhibits protease- and PAR2-mediated inflammation in rats (Barryet al.,2010; Suenet al.,2012; Lohmanet al.,2012a,2012b). GB88 also inhibits the effects of trypsin and synthetic PAR2 agonists on Ca2+signalling in multiple human cell lines (Suenet al.,2012; Lohmanet al.,2012a). The molecular mechanism by which GB88 antagonizes PAR2 is not fully understood. GB88 is a competitive antagonist of SLIGRL-NH2and 2fLIGRLO-NH2, surmountable and PAR2-selective (Suenet al.,2012), displaying antagonism of Galphaqsignalling but activation of other G-protein coupled signalling pathways (Suenet al.,2014). However, it has not been reported yet whether GB88 binds at the same (orthosteric) site as the tethered ligand. We found that GB88 antagonizes the activation of PAR2 by multiple proteases and synthetic agonists. Trypsin and cathepsin-S cleave PAR2 at different sites to reveal distinctly different tethered ligands, whereas elastase activates PAR2 by a non-tethered ligand mechanism (Zhaoet al.,2014a,2015). Although the trypsin-exposed tethered ligand interacts with the second extracellular loop of PAR2 (Ossovskaya and Bunnett,2004), the binding site of the cathepsin-S-revealed tethered ligand is unknown. Thus, GB88 likely antagonizes PAR2 by stabilizing an inactive conformation because it does not inhibit cleavage nor binding of a specific tethered ligand, rather it inhibits activation by multiple proteases, multiple peptide agonists and also nonpeptide agonists. Further studies are required to define the mechanisms by which GB88 specifically inhibits cathepsin-S and elastase activation of PAR2. TRP channels are downstream targets of PAR2. PAR2 can sensitize TRPV1, and TRPV1 deletion or antagonism inhibits PAR2-dependent hyperalgesia (Amadesiet al.,2004). We found that GB88 did not affect capsaicin-evoked calcium signals in nociceptors, consistent with its inability to inhibit the proinflammatory and hyperalgesic actions of capsaicin. These findings support the conclusion that GB88 prevents protease activation of nociceptors, inflammation and pain by antagonism of PAR2 rather than TRPV1. To confirm that the effects of GB88 were not due to protease inhibition, we examined whether GB88 inhibits protease activity. By using a fluorogenic assay to mimic conditions of protease signalling to nociceptors in culture, we found that GB88 (10 muM) did not affect trypsin or elastase activity and had a modest effect on cathepsin-S activity. When pre-incubated with activity-based probes, GB88 did not affect trypsin, cathepsin-S or elastase binding. Thus, the effects of GB88 on inflammation and pain are more likely due to antagonism of PAR2 rather than inhibition of protease activity. Multiple proteases become activated during injury and inflammation. The activity of these proteases is regulated by a large number of endogenous protease inhibitors. Thus, the balance between protease activation and inhibition is likely to be of crucial importance for the control of inflammatory and neuropathic pain. For example, cathepsin-S is activated in macrophages and spinal microglial cells during colitis and in neuropathic pain states (Clarket al.,2007; Cattaruzzaet al.,2011), and mast cell tryptase is elevated in patients with visceral pain (Barbaraet al.,2004). Elastase released from leukocytes within sensory ganglia can contribute to neuropathic pain, which is exacerbated by deficiency in the elastase inhibitor serpinA3N (Vicunaet al.,2015). Thus, the finding that GB88 inhibits the pronociceptive actions of diverse proteases suggests a potential to suppress different forms of inflammatory and neuropathic pain that are associated with the differential activation of proteases. The findings reported here support the usefulness of GB88 and potentially other PAR2 antagonists to inhibit inflammatory and painful conditions. T.M.L. and E.S. analysed nociception and inflammation.
