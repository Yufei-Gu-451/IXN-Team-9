Repeated, extreme, or traumatic stressors can elicit pathological effects leading to many negative physical and psychological outcomes. Stressors can precipitate the onset of psychiatric diseases, or exacerbate pre-existing disorders including various anxiety and mood disorders. As stressors can negatively impact human psychiatric health, it is essential to identify neurochemicals that may confer protection from the negative sequelae of repeated or extreme stress exposure. Elucidating the neurobiological underpinnings of stress resilience will enhance our ability to promote resilience to, or recovery from, stress-related psychiatric disease. Herein, we will review the evidence for neuropeptide Y as an endogenous mediator of resilience and its potential relevance for the treatment of stress-related psychiatric diseases. Overview of neuropeptide Y and receptor subtypes in the central nervous system. Alterations of neuropeptide Y in human stress-related psychiatric disorders. Evidence for neuropeptide Y in resilience to stress-related emotionality in rodent behavioral models. Pharmacotherapeutic implications for neuropeptide Y in the treatment of stress-related psychiatric disorders.
