Thickening of mitral leaflets, endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), and activated myofibroblast-like interstitial cells have been observed in ischemic mitral valve regurgitation. We set out to determine if interactions between mitral valve endothelial cells (VEC) and interstitial cells (VIC) might affect these alterations. We used in vitro co-culture in TranswellTM inserts to test the hypothesis that VIC secrete factors that inhibit EndMT and conversely, that VEC secrete factors that mitigate the activation of VIC to a myofibroblast-like, activated phenotype. Primary cultures and clonal populations of ovine mitral VIC and VEC were used. Western blot, quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qPCR) and functional assays were used to assess changes in cell phenotype and behavior. VIC or conditioned media from VIC inhibited transforming growth factorbeta (TGFbeta)-induced EndMT in VEC, as indicated by reduced expression of EndMT markers alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), Slug, Snai1 and MMP-2 and maintained ability of VEC to mediate leukocyte adhesion, an important endothelial function. VEC or conditioned media from VEC reversed the spontaneous cell culture-induced change in VIC to an activated phenotype, as indicated by reduced expression of alpha-SMA and type I collagen, increased expression chondromodulin-1 (Chm1), and reduced contractile activity. These results demonstrate that mitral VEC and VIC secrete soluble factors that can reduce VIC activation and inhibit TGFbeta-driven EndMT, respectively. These findings suggest that the endothelium of the mitral valve is critical for the maintenance of a quiescent VIC phenotype and that, in turn, VIC prevent EndMT. We speculate that disturbance of the ongoing reciprocal interactions between VEC and VICs
