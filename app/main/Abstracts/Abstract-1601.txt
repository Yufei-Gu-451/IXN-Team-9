Mitotic phosphorylation of Exo84 disrupts the assembly of the exocyst complex, thereby inhibiting exocytosis of select secreted cargoes and cell surface expansion. The rate of eukaryotic cell growth is tightly controlled for proper progression through each cell cycle stage and is important for cell size homeostasis. It was previously shown that cell growth is inhibited during mitosis when cells are preparing for division. However, the mechanism for growth arrest at this stage is unknown. Here we demonstrate that exocytosis of a select group of cargoes was inhibited before the metaphase-anaphase transition in the budding yeast
