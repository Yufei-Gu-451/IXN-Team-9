To evaluate the intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility of Hawkins' classification for fractures of the neck of the talus. 20 random cases of fracture of the talus were selected, to be defined according to the classification of types by eight orthopedic surgeons, 13 orthopedic residents and 15 radiology residents. Using the statistical test of Landis and Koch, measurements of 0.627 and 0.668 were obtained in the first and second evaluations, respectively. These values define a satisfactory agreement for Hawkins' classification. We conclude that this classification is reproducible between observers, with better values for the more experienced observers.
