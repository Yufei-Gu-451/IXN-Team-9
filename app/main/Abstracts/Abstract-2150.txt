Persons with diabetes have accelerated muscle loss compared with their counterparts. The relationship of hyperglycemia per se to declines in muscle function has not been explored yet has implications for developing appropriate intervention strategies to prevent muscle loss. We examined 984 participants aged 25-96 years in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (2003-2011) with HbAMuscle strength and quality were significantly lower across HbAHyperglycemia is associated with persistently lower muscle strength with aging, but this effect may be mediated, at least in part, by peripheral neuropathy. Future studies should explore if better glycemic control can preserve muscle function in diabetes.
