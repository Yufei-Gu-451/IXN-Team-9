Management of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) ankylosis is challenging for the oral and maxillofacial surgeon because it involves the mouth opening, dentofacial deformity, diet problem, and quality of life. Although surgical techniques to treat TMJ ankylosis have improved, reankylosis is a persistent problem. The temporalis myofascial flap provides good material for interpositional arthroplasty, because of its good vascular supply, anatomic proximity, and adequate thickness. This case report examines the efficacy of submandibular anchorage to prevent reankylosis by inhibiting flap dislocation.
