Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are highly prevalent in obese youth. Herein, we aimed to study the association between hepatic fat accumulation as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging and circulating levels of cytokeratin-18 (CK-18) fragments, a robust NASH biomarker, and to explore the impact on this association of ethnicity, insulin resistance, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with steatosis (rs738409 in theTwo-hundred twenty-nine obese youths (87 Caucasians, 61 African Americans, and 81 Hispanics; mean age, 12.8 +/- 2.9 years; mean BMI, 31.4 +/- 7.4) underwent magnetic resonance imaging, oral glucose tolerance test, and CK-18 levels measurement; 12 subjects underwent liver biopsy. African Americans showed lower CK-18 levels than Hispanics (African Americans have lower levels of CK-18 than Caucasians and Hispanics irrespective of HFF% and insulin resistance. Moreover, SNPs in the
