Direct40 randomly selected patients (mean age 41 +/- 15 years) were enrolled in this study. 39 patients underwent a conventional clinical assessment, dental bitewing X-ray and a dental MRI investigation comprising a conventional turbo-spin echo (TSE) and a dedicated UTE scan. One patient had to be excluded owing to claustrophobia. In four patients, the clinical treatment of the lesions was documented by intraoral pictures, and the resulting volume of the cavity after excavation was documented by dental imprints and compared with the MRI findings. In total, 161 lesions were identified. 157 (97%) were visible in the UTE images, 27 (17%) in the conventional TSE images and 137 (85%) in the X-ray images. In total, 14 teeth could not be analysed by MR owing to artefacts caused by dental fillings. All lesions appear significantly larger in the UTE images as compared with the X-ray and TSE images. The presented data provide evidence that UTE MR imaging can be applied for the identification of caries lesions. Although the current data suggest an even higher sensitivity of UTE MRI, some limitations must be expected from dental fillings.
