Retrospective evaluation of cases of limb replantation after avulsion injuries. Evaluation of the techniques and tactics used, that contributed to success and good functional results. Forty-three patients' records were assessed. All the cases had been submitted to limb replantation after avulsion injuries. The majority of the cases were young men. The most common injury was to the thumbs. The surgical techniques and tactics used were: nerve grafting, vein grafting, transposition of the digital vessels, limb shortening, and heterotopic replantation. The most commonly used technique was vein graft. The limb survival rate was high (93%), as was patient satisfaction. Replantation after avulsion injury depends on the correct diagnosis of the limb viability and the use of appropriate surgical techniques and tactics for each case. The experience of the team of surgeons and a good hospital structure are essential for good results. There are few articles in medical literature about the indications, techniques and results of limb replantation after avulsion injuries. We believe that this retrospective evaluation can bring new information and contributions to the correct management of this highly complex situation.
