Although we previously demonstrated that MIBG imaging might be useful in monitoring the response to chemotherapy in patients with neuroblastoma[None], no studies have been performed to assess chemotherapy efficacy in patients with malignant pheochromocytoma by MIBG or PET imaging. Imaging with radiolabeled MIBG is able to detect adrenal and extra-adrenal tumor masses, such as pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma; in particular, tumor lesions that concentrate MIBG can be benign or malignant and the ability to detect tumors on MIBG scans depends on both tumor size and differentiation[None]. The aim of this study was to investigate the usefulness of molecular imaging with MIBG for evaluating the effects of combination chemotherapy on individual tumor lesions by monitoring MIBG uptake changes after treatment in patients with malignant pheochromocytoma. The results of the present study show that successful combination chemotherapy of malignant pheochromocytoma leads to a reduction in catecholamine production and MIBG uptake by these tumors. In the present study, we propose that serial MIBG imaging can be useful in monitoring patients with malignant pheochromocytoma who are receiving chemotherapy. [None]demonstrated that FDG-PET is a useful method for evaluating the effect of [131I]MIBG therapy in patients with malignant pheochromocytoma. Previous studies have demonstrated, by measuring urinary catecholamine and metanephrine levels or RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) criteria, that combination chemotherapy can be effective for advanced malignant pheochromocytomas[None]. In the follow-up evaluation of neoplastic disease, differentiation of viable tumor from fibrosis is of fundamental importance and often requires needle biopsy; for this purpose, another way to non-invasively monitor the effects of chemotherapy is to assess the viability of a tumor using molecular imaging modalities; in this regard, the role of nuclear medicine techniques has been previously suggested[None,None]. In particular, this patient had 37 sites of disease identified by MIBG imaging; after 4.1 months of chemotherapy, MIBG uptake decreased in 13 lesions and disappeared in another 12. This summed value represented the total abnormal MIBG uptake and was used to compare pre- and post-chemotherapy MIBG scans in each patient.
