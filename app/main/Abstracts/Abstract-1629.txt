Bone is a load-bearing tissue and physical forces play key roles in the development and maintenance of its structure. Mechanical cues can stimulate the expression of an osteogenic phenotype, enhance matrix and mineral deposition, and influence tissue organization to improve the functional outcome of engineered bone grafts. In recent years, a number of studies have investigated the effects of biophysical forces on the bone formation properties of osteoprogenitor cells. The application of physiologically relevant stimuli to tissue-engineered bone may be determined through observation and understanding of forces to which osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and osteocytes are exposed in native bone. Subsequently, these cues may be parameterized and their effects studied in well-defined
