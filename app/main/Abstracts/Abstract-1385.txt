Survival rates following traumatic cardiac arrest (TCA) are known to be poor but resuscitation is not universally futile. There are a number of potentially reversible causes to TCA and a well-defined group of survivors. There are distinct differences in the pathophysiology between medical cardiac arrests and TCA. The authors present some of the key differences and evidence related to resuscitation in TCA, and suggest a separate algorithm for the management of out-of-hospital TCA attended by a highly trained physician and paramedic team.
