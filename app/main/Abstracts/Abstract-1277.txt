In adults, 1-h glucose during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) predicts the development of type 2 diabetes independent of fasting and 2-h glucose concentrations. The purpose of the current investigation was to examine the utility of elevated 1-h glucose levels to prospectively predict deterioration in beta-cell function and the development of prediabetes in high-risk youth. Obese Latino youth with a family history of type 2 diabetes (133 male and 100 female; age 11.1 +/- 1.7 years) completed a baseline OGTT and were divided into two groups based upon a 1-h glucose threshold of 155 mg/dL ( less than 155 mg/dL,Over time, the =155 mg/dL group exhibited a significantly greater decline in beta-cell function compared with youth with a 1-h glucose 155 mg/dL (beta = -327.8 +/- 126.2,These data suggest that a 1-h glucose greater than =155 mg/dL during an OGTT is an independent predictor of beta-cell deterioration and progression to prediabetes among obese Latino youth.
