Predicting physical and functional links between cellular components is a fundamental challenge of biology and network science. Yet, correlations, a ubiquitous input for biological link prediction, are affected by both direct and indirect effects, confounding our ability to identify true pairwise interactions. Here we exploit the fundamental properties of dynamical correlations in networks to develop a method to silence indirect effects. The method receives as input the observed correlations between node pairs and uses a matrix transformation to turn the correlation matrix into a highly discriminative silenced matrix, which enhances only the terms associated with direct causal links. Achieving perfect accuracy in model systems, we test the method against empirical data collected for the
