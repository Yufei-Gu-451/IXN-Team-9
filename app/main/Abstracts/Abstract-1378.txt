Steroid receptor coactivator 3 (SRC3) is an important coactivator of a number of transcription factors and is associated with a poor outcome in numerous tumours. Steroid receptor coactivator 3 is amplified in 25% of epithelial ovarian cancers (EOCs) and its expression is higher in EOCs compared with non-malignant tissue. No data is currently available with regard to the expression of SRC-3 in EOC and its influence on outcome or the efficacy of treatment. Immunohistochemistry was performed for SRC3, oestrogen receptor-Steroid receptor coactivator 3 expression was significantly associated with advanced stage and was an independent prognostic marker. High expression of SRC3 identified patients who have a significantly poorer survival with single-agent carboplatin chemotherapy, while with carboplatin/paclitaxel treatment such a difference was not seen. Steroid receptor coactivator 3 is a poor prognostic factor in EOCs and appears to identify a population of patients who would benefit from the addition of taxanes to their chemotherapy regimen, due to intrinsic resistance to platinum therapy.
