Despite its eradication over 30 years ago, smallpox (as well as other orthopoxviruses) remains a pathogen of interest both in terms of biodefense and for its use as a vector for vaccines and immunotherapies. Here we describe the application of mRNA-Seq transcriptome profiling to understanding immune responses in smallpox vaccine recipients. Contrary to other studies examining gene expression in virally infected cell lines, we utilized a mixed population of PBMCs in order to capture the essential intercellular interactions that occur
