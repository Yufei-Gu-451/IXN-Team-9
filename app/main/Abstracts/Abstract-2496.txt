Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is a powerful prognostic biomarker in a subset of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, specifically oropharyngeal cancers. However, the role of HPV in non-oropharyngeal sites, such as the larynx, remains unconfirmed. We evaluated a cohort of 324 laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) patients for the expression of p16Of 307 patients assessable for p16 IHC, 20 (6.5%) were p16 positive. Females and node-positive patients were more likely to be p16 positive (p16 overexpression is infrequent in LSCC and the proportion of cases with high-risk HPV transcripts is even lower. There are no statistically significant correlations between p16 IHC or HPV RNA ISH status and OS or disease outcomes.
