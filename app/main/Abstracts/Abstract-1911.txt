T cell receptors (TCRs) pair in millions of combinations to create complex and personally unique T cell repertoires. Using tetramers to analyze CD1b-reactive TCRs, we detected T cells with highly stereotyped TCR alpha chains present among genetically unrelated tuberculosis patients. These germline-encoded mycolyl-reactive (GEM) T cells were defined by CD4 expression and rearrangement of TRAV1-2 to TRAJ9 with few N-region additions. TCR analysis by high throughput sequencing, binding and crystallography showed linkage of TCR alpha sequence motifs to high affinity antigen recognition. Thus, the CD1-reactive TCR repertoire is composed of at least two compartments, high affinity GEM TCRs and more diverse TCRs with low affinity for CD1b-lipid complexes. These data demonstrate high inter-donor conservation of TCRs, which likely results from selection by a non-polymorphic antigen presenting molecule and an immunodominant antigen.
