Obesity and inflammation are both risk factors for a variety of cancers including breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Intake of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3 PUFAs) decreases the risk of breast cancer, and also reduces obesity-associated inflammation and insulin resistance, but whether the two effects are related is currently unknown. We tested this hypothesis in a postmenopausal breast cancer model using ovariectomized (OVX), immune-competent female mice with orthotopically injected with Py230 mammary tumor cells. Obesity, whether triggered genetically or by high-fat diet (HFD) feeding, increased inflammation in the mammary fat pad and promoted mammary tumorigenesis. The presence of tumor cells in the mammary fat pad further enhanced the local inflammatory milieu. TNF-alpha was the most highly up-regulated cytokine in the obese mammary fat pad, and we observed that TNF-alpha dose-dependently stimulated Py230 cell growth
