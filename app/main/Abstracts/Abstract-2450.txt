Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of the cavo-tricuspid isthmus (CTI) is one of the most frequently performed procedures in electrophysiology. Despite a high success rate, ablation of the CTI can be unusually difficult in some cases. Multiple tools like angiography, 3D mapping, remote navigation and intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) have been introduced to facilitate typical flutter ablation. This review article summarizes the clinical value of different strategies and tools used for CTI ablation focusing on the importance of approaches utilizing ICE.
