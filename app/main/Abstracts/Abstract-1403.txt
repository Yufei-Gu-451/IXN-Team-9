Telomeres are specialized chromatin structures essential for maintenance of chromosomal integrity and stability. Obesity has been proposed to be associated with telomere shortening; however, epidemiologic evidence has been conflicting. We conducted a study to evaluate the associations of telomere length with various anthropometric indices of general and abdominal obesity, as well as weight change. The study included 2,912 Chinese women ages 40-70 years. Monochrome multiplex quantitative PCR was applied to measure relative telomere length. ANOVA and the Dunnett test were used to compare log-transformed relative telomere length. Tests for linear trend were performed by entering the ordinal exposure as continuous parameters in the models. There is an inverse association between telomere length and body mass index (BMI) (Our findings provide strong evidence supporting the hypothesis that telomere shortening is associated with obesity and that maintaining body weight within a normal range helps maintain telomere length.
