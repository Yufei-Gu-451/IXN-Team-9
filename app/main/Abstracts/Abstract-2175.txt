To examine the tracking and significance of beverage consumption in infancy and childhood. Among 1163 children in Project Viva, we examined associations of fruit juice and water intake at 1 year (0 oz, 1-7 oz [small], 8-15 oz [medium], and greater than =16 oz [large]) with juice and sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) intake and BMI z-score during early (median 3.1 years) and mid-childhood (median 7.7 years). In covariate adjusted models, juice intake at one year was associated with greater juice and sugar sweetened beverages intake during early and mid-childhood and also greater adiposity. Children who drank medium and large amounts of juice at 1 year had higher BMI z-scores during both early (Medium: beta=0.16 [95%CI=0.01, 0.32]; Large: beta=0.28 [95%CI=0.01, 0.56]) and mid-childhood (Medium: beta=0.23 [95%CI=0.07, 0.39]; Large: beta=0.36 [95%CI=0.08, 0.64]). After covariate adjustment, associations between water intake at 1 year and beverage intake and adiposity later in childhood were null. Higher juice intake at 1 year was associated with higher juice intake, sugar sweetened beverage intake, and BMI z-score during early and mid-childhood. Assessing juice intake during infancy could provide clinicians important data regarding future unhealthy beverage habits and excess adiposity during childhood.
