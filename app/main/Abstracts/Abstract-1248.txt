Genetic and immunological screening for type 1 diabetes has led to the possibility of preventing disease in susceptible individuals. Here, we show that human mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (hMSCs) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha-stimulated gene 6 (TSG-6), a protein produced by hMSCs in response to signals from injured tissues, delayed the onset of spontaneous autoimmune diabetes in NOD mice by inhibiting insulitis and augmenting regulatory T cells (Tregs) within the pancreas. Importantly, hMSCs with a knockdown of
