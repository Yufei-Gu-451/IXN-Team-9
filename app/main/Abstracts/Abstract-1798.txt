Evaluate incidence of Magerl's A and B group in thoracolumbar burst fracture (Denis) according to independent examiners. According to the posterior spinous process split on the anterior posterior radiography, three independent examiners have analyzed the patients admitted from 2000 to 2009 with thoracolumbar burst fractures (according to Denis) to differentiate between Magerl's type A3 and B1.2. Statistical evaluation was descriptive and by using Kappa's method. From the 72 patients, 11 patients compose the Magerl's type B group according to examiner 1; 10 according to examiner 2; and 17 according to examiner 3. Posterior lesion concordance was satisfactory (good, kappa=0.7) between the examiners. 14 to 24% patients with thoracolumbar fractures show posterior lesion (B1.2) by using radiographic criteria.
