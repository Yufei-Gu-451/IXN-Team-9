To study the difference of post-op patellofemoral pain, clunk and crepitus in patients with/without resurfacing at 5 years who had pre-op patellofemoral pain. To study the incidence of post-operative patellofemoral pain, clunk and crepitus following patelloplasty in both the groups. Retrospective review of 765 patients who had total knee replacement with/without resurfacing.Patients were asked about both pre-operative pain and also post-operative pain 5 years after the operation. Patients were examined by a specialist nurse at 5 years post-operatively to check for any patellofemoral clunk/crepitus. In patients with pre-op PF pain, there is significant (p less than 0.005) higher incidence of post-op clunk in the R group. In patients without pre-op PF pain, there is significantly (p less than 0.005) higher incidence of post-op crepitus in the R group. In patients with/without pre-op PF pain, the incidence of post-op PF pain, clunk and crepitus is lower than in patients who underwent patelloplasty when compared to the other members of the NR group (statistically significant p less than 0.005).
