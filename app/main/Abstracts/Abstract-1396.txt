The optimal target blood pressure in septic shock is still unknown. Therefore, in a long-term, resuscitated porcine model of fecal peritonitis-induced septic shock, Correa and colleagues tested whether different titrations of mean arterial pressure (50 to 60 and 75 to 85 mm Hg) would produce different effects on sepsis-related organ dysfunction. The higher blood pressure window was associated with increased needs for fluid resuscitation and norepinephrine support. However, titrating the lower blood pressure range coincided with an increased incidence of acute kidney injury. In contrast, neither the inflammatory response nor tissue mitochondrial activity showed any difference. This research paper in a clinically relevant model elegantly demonstrates that any standard resuscitation strategy may be a double-edged sword with respect to various therapeutic endpoints. Furthermore, it adds an important piece to the puzzle of the complex pathophysiology of sepsis-related acute kidney injury.
