Protein acetylation of lysine epsilon-amino groups is abundant in cells, particularly within mitochondria. The contribution of enzyme-catalyzed and nonenzymatic acetylation in mitochondria remains unresolved. Here, we utilize a newly developed approach to measure site-specific, nonenzymatic acetylation rates for 90 sites in eight native purified proteins. Lysine reactivity (as second-order rate constants) with acetyl-phosphate and acetyl-CoA ranged over 3 orders of magnitude, and higher chemical reactivity tracked with likelihood of dynamic modification
