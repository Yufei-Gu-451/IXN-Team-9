In 2 studies, decrease in hepatic perfusion was cited as a reason because decreased liver perfusion fraction was observed in the cirrhotic liver, measured using multiplebvalue DW-MRI and analysed using the principles of intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM)[None,None]. In patients with colorectal hepatic metastases, mean lesional ADC values have been shown to increase in response to chemotherapy in those patients showing at least a partial response[None,None], reflecting a reduction in tissue cellular density and barriers to water movement. Improvement in lesion detection with DW-MRI can be explained by improved lesion to background image contrast using lowbvalue (or black-blood) images, which helps to differentiate small metastases from intrahepatic vasculature[None]. Of the benign solid lesions, hepatic haemangiomas have the highest ADC value, typically higher than the adjacent liver parenchyma, which can be ascribed to the T2 shine-through effect (Fig. Application of a small diffusion weighting (b less than 50-150 s mm-2) nulls the intrahepatic vascular signal resulting in black-blood images that improve the detection of focal liver lesions while maintaining a high SNR (Fig. From these studies, the mean ADC values measured on DW-MRI seem to have a limited range to distinguish early stages of fibrosis (e.g. The use of higherbvalues ( greater than 500 s mm-2) facilitates liver lesion characterization, helping to distinguish between cystic and solid lesions[None,None]. However, differentiation between different solid lesions is difficult based on visual assessment because these lesions, whether benign or malignant, demonstrate impeded diffusion on the highbvalue images. Quantitative ADC measurements can be used to aid focal liver lesion characterization, but it may be difficult to confidently describe a lesion as benign or malignant based on ADC values alone, due to the considerable overlap between groups of hepatic pathologies. These studies (Table 3) demonstrated that DW-MRI has a high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of liver metastases[None,None]. For example, studies have shown that using IVIM analysis, cirrhotic liver shows a lower perfusion fraction and pseudodiffusion coefficient. [None]assessed hepatic entropy ADC values in addition to mean ADC values in patients with chronic hepatitis C. The entropy ADC provides information related to variation in the volume histogram of ADC and has previously been applied in the neurologic system[None,None]. When DW-MRI was performed after the administration of superparamagnetic iron oxide contrast medium, lesion detection was also improved by suppression of background liver signal[None]. However, an earlier study found no correlation between ADC values and hepatic fat fraction, although MR spectroscopy and dual-echo chemical shift imaging in the same population showed good correlation with hepatic fat fraction[None]. As a non-contrast-enhanced technique, DW-MRI is particularly useful in patients with severe renal dysfunction at risk of developing nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) after administration of gadolinium-based contrast medium[None]. However, to enable meaningful interpretation and for confidence in ascribing an observed ADC change to real treatment effects rather than to biological, instrumental or observer variations, it is important to establish the ADC measurement reproducibility of the scanner system[None]. Compared with T2-weighted MRI, the use of lowbvalues to generate black-blood images has been shown to result in comparable image quality but improved lesion detection[None,None,None], particularly for lesions less than or equal to 1 cm in diameter[None], for lesions lying adjacent to blood vessels and for those located in the right hepatic lobe[None]. In addition, recent studies have found that combining DW-MRI with conventional contrast-enhanced MRI can improve the detection of HCC, compared with contrast-enhanced MRI on its own[None](Fig. One probable explanation for this observation is that protons associated with intra- and extracellular fat have reduced diffusivity, thus resulting in a lower ADC compared with normal parenchyma[None]. Studies have been carried out on both primary and metastatic hepatic lesions to assess treatment-related DW-MRI changes.
