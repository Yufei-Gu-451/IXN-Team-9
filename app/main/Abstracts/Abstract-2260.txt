Iron salts and N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands is a highly effective combination in catalysis, with observed catalytic activities being highly dependent on the nature of the NHC ligand. Detailed spectroscopic and electronic structure studies have been performed on both three- and four-coordinate iron(
