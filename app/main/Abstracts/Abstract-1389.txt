To test the hypothesis that DrotAA, as compared with placebo, would reduce mortality in patients with septic shock. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial, conducted from March 2008 through August 2011. Patients were followed until either 90 days or death. Patients were enrolled from 208 sights in Europe, North and South America, Australia, New Zealand, and India. Subjects included 1,697 patients with infection, systemic inflammation, and shock who were receiving fluids and vasopressors above a threshold dose for 4 hours. DrotAA (at a dose of 24 mug per kilogram of body weight per hour) or placebo for 96 hours. Death from any cause 28 days after randomization. At 28 days, 223 of 846 patients (26.4%) in the DrotAA group and 202 of 834 (24.2%) in the placebo group had died (relative risk in the DrotAA group, 1.09; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.92 to 1.28;DrotAA did not significantly reduce mortality at 28 or 90 days, as compared with placebo, in patients with septic shock.
