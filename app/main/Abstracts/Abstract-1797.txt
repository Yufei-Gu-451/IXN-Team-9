To compare the static postural balance between women suffering from chronic low back pain and healthy subjects, by moving the center of pressure. The study included 15 women with low back pain (LBP group) and 15 healthy women (healthy group). They were instructed to remain in standing on the force platform for 30 seconds. We analyzed the area and the speed of displacement of center of pressure of both groups. Data analysis was performed using the Student's t-test, with significance of 5%. Individuals with chronic low back pain showed a larger area of displacement of the center of pressure relative to the healthy ones but there was no significant difference in the speed of displacement of the center of pressure. Individuals with chronic low back pain had alterations in static balance with respect to healthy ones.
