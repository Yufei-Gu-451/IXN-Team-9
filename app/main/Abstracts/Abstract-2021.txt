Endovaginal MRI (evMRI) at 3.0-T with T2-weighted (T2-W) and ZOnal Oblique Multislice (ZOOM)-diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) potentially improves the detection of stage Ia/Ib1 cervical cancer. We aimed to determine its sensitivity/specificity, document tumour-to-stromal contrast and establish the effect of imaging on surgical management. Following ethical approval and written informed consent, 57 consecutive patients with suspected stage Ia/Ib1 cervical cancer underwent evMRI at 3.0-T using T2-W and ZOOM-DWI. Sensitivity/specificity were calculated against histopathology for two independent observers. Tumour-to-stromal contrast was determined on T2-W, and diffusion-weighted (b=800 s mmSensitivity/specificity for detecting tumour was the following: reporting read 88.0/81.8%, anonymised read 92.0/81.8% (observer 1); 84.0/72.7% (observer2; median tumour volume=1.7 cmT2-W+ZOOM-DWI evMRI has high sensitivity/specificity for detecting stage Ia/Ib1 cervical tumours; in patients due for RVT, the surgical management was altered in ?39%.
