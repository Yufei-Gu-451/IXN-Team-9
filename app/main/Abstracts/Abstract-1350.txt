Clinical outcome of high-risk melanoma patients is not reliably predicted from histopathological analyses of primary tumours and is often adjusted during disease progression. Our study aimed at extending our previous findings in skin metastases to evaluate the prognostic value of tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TYRP1) in lymph node metastases of stages III and IV melanoma patients. TYRP1 mRNA expression in 104 lymph node metastases was quantified by real-time PCR and normalised to S100 calcium-binding protein B (S100B) mRNA expression to correct for tumour load. TYRP1/S100B ratios were calculated and median was used as cutoff value. TYRP1/S100B mRNA values were correlated to clinical follow-up and histopathological characteristics of the primary lesion. A high TYRP1/S100B mRNA ratio significantly correlated with reduced disease-free (DFS) and overall survival (OS; Cox regression analysis,High TYRP1/S100B mRNA expression in lymph node metastases from melanoma patients is associated with unfavourable clinical outcome. Its evaluation in lymph node metastases may refine initial prognosis for metastatic patients, may define prognosis for those with unknown or non-evaluable primary lesions and may allow different management of the two groups of patients.
