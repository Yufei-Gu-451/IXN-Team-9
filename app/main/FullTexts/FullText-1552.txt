Plants mount elaborate defence mechanisms to protect themselves from various environmental stresses (Hutcheson, 1998). Programmed cell death is one key defence mechanism in plants, and is an important process involved in development and defence responses against biotic and abiotic stresses (DanglNone, 1996). In plant-microbe interactions, programmed cell death occurs during the hypersensitive response (HR) to avirulent pathogens, as well as in response to an attack by a virulent pathogen (Greenberg, 1997). As a typical resistant response, HR is characterized as a rapid and localized cell death that occurs at or around the infection sites that are caused by avirulent pathogens, and its purpose is to protect plants from further pathogen colonization. HR is triggered by the recognition of a plantresistance(R) gene product and a pathogenavirulence(Avr) gene product in a gene-for-gene manner (GreenbergNone, 2000). In addition to the HR-induced cell death, a class of lesion-mimic (Les/les) mutants is ubiquitous in plants, characterized by misregulated cell death phenotypes that mimic the HR. Unlike the HR, theLes/lesmutant spontaneously forms lesions in the absence of any injuries, stresses, or pathogen infections (Neuffer and Calvert, 1975;WalbotNone, 1983). A large number of lesion-mimic mutants have been isolated in higher plants, and some have been characterized in detail. Lesion mimics are sometimes associated with enhanced disease resistance, including elevated expression of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes and other markers that are indicative of defence system activation (WolterNone, 1993;DietrichNone, 1994). So far, many genes that are responsible for lesion-mimic phenotypes have been identified. Some of these genes encode enzymes that are involved in chlorophyll metabolism. Maize mutants deficient inles22, which encodes a key enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway of chlorophyll and heme, develop minute necrotic spots on leaves from the accumulation of photo-excitable uroporphyrin (HuNone, 1998). In addition to the chlorophyll synthesis mutants, theArabidopsis acd2mutant defective in the red chlorophyll catabolite reductase (RCCR), which can break down red chlorophyll catabolites (RCCs)in vitro, exhibits a light-dependent lesion phenotype due to the excessive accumulation of phototoxic RCCs (MatileNone, 1999;MachNone, 2001). Pheophorbideaoxygenase (PaO) catalyses the oxygenation of pheophorbidea. It is an important chlorophyll breakdown enzyme. PaO was first cloned from maize under the nameZmLls1with two conserved motifs, namely a Rieske-type centre and a mononuclear non-heme Fe-binding site, which make it resemble aromatic ring-hydroylating dioxygenases (GrayNone, 1997,2002). The absence ofZmLls1in maize resulted in a chloroplast-mediated cell death phenotype (GrayNone, 1997,2002) that was influenced by light (CloseNone, 1995), physical wounding (YangNone, 2004), and pathogen attack (ObanniNone, 1994). Furthermore, the maizells1mutant exhibited elevated resistance to fungal pathogens at the leaf epidermis by reducing the lesion ratio and/or causing fungal sterility. Meanwhile, plants withlls1-type lesions accumulate high levels of PR1 and chitinase proteins (SimmonsNone, 1998). Cell death is more likely to be triggered in thells1mutant through the accumulation of phototoxic pheophorbideathan by interfering with the cell death suppression mechanism (GrayNone, 1997). TheArabidopsisaccelerated cell death 1 (ACD1) gene, which is similar to PaO, is involved in the oxygenation of pheophorbideaand breaks down chlorophyll (PruzinskaNone, 2003). In comparison with thells1mutant, an excessive amount of pheophorbideais accumulated when chlorophyll breakdown occurs in transgenicArabidopsisAs-ACD1plants, and cell death is induced under both darkness and illumination. Therefore, it appears that the accumulation of pheophorbideanot only enhances the oxidation of cellular components but also functions as a signal molecule or is able to inhibit a specific enzyme that induces cell death (HirashimaNone, 2009). In addition to PaO mutants in maize andArabidopsis, knockdown ofOsPAOin rice results in the accumulation of pheophorbideaand triggers cell death in rice seedlings. OsPAOis constitutively expressed in rice plants but induced by natural senescence and physical wounding (TangNone, 2011). PaO has been shown to be a suppressor of cell death in plants as a consequence of its catalytic activity in chlorophyll degradation, but the exact mechanism of cell death as regulated by PaO remains elusive. In this study, we isolated one wheat PaO homologue and characterized its function in cell death and disease resistance toPuccinia striiformisf.sp. tritici(Pst). We showed that the wheatlethal leaf-spot 1gene,TaLls1, was wound inducible. In theTaLls1-knockdown lines, silencing ofTaLls1led to leaf cell death, suggesting a cell death suppressor role ofTaLls1. Meanwhile, cell death was triggered inTaLls1-overexpressed wheat and tobacco leaves, which further proved a positive correlation of cell death and TaLls1 accumulation. Thereby, we presumed a rheostat role ofTaLls1in cell death regulation with a delicate threshold to maintain cell homeostasis in adaption to various stress. Deletion mutant analyses revealed that the conserved Rieske domain in the TaLls1 protein was essential for the cell death induction in overexpressing leaves. Furthermore, during the wheat-Pstinteraction,TaLls1-knockdown plants exhibited reduced susceptibility to virulent stripe rust fungus. Our results demonstrated a negative regulation ofTaLls1in wheat resistance toPstand provide new insight for a role ofTaLls1in cell death regulation, not only as a cell death suppressor. A Suwon 11 wheat genotype containingYrSu,Puccinia striiformisf.sp. tritici(Pst) pathotype CYR23 (avirulent) and thePstpathotype CYR31 (virulent) were used in the wheat-Pstinteraction study. The plant growth conditions and inoculation ofPstwere operated as described byKang and Li (1984). To studyTaLls1expression levels in wheat leaves that were infected byPstCYR31 or CYR23, leaf tissues were sampled at 0, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 120h post-inoculation (p.i.). Parallel mock-inoculated control plants were brushed with sterile water. Three biological replicates were used for each assay. Nicotiana benthamianaplants used for transient overexpression ofTaLls1by particle bombardment were grown at an ambient temperature of 25 degrees C and light conditions of 16h light/8h dark. Chemical treatments were performed as described byWangNone(2012None).To cause wounding, the first leaves were mechanically scraped with a needle. For the cold treatment, leaves of the same developmental stage were kept at 4 degrees C. Leaves that were treated with various chemicals and stress elicitors along with the control plants were harvested at 0, 2, 6, 12, 24, and 48h post-treatment (p.t.). All samples were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 degrees C. Three biological replications were performed independently for each time point. Total RNA from wheat leaves treated with exogenous hormones, challenged by abiotic stresses, infected with stripe rust, and derived from different wheat organs was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Two micrograms of total RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA with an oligo(dT)18primer using an RT-PCR system (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The expression pattern ofTaLls1under the different conditions as described above were detected by qRT-PCR following the procedure described byWangNone(2009)using a 7500 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The wheat elongation factorTaEF-1agene (GenBank accession no. Q03033) was used as the internal reference for each qRT-PCR. All reactions were performed in triplicate, and reactions with non-template were used as negative controls. The comparative 2-DeltaDeltaCTmethod was used to quantify relative gene expression (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001). The primers used for qRT-PCR are listed inSupplementary Table S1atJXBonline. Following the known sequence of the partial 3' end of the cDNA fragment, a set of Race-5R primers that were geared towards the 5' end was designed. 5' RACE was performed using a SMART RACE cDNA Amplification Kit (Clontech, Mountain view, CA, USA). The full-length sequence ofTaLls1was assembled using the CAP3 Sequence Assembly Program. The conserved motifs and domain structure of TaLls1 protein were analysed using InterPro Scan. TMpred was used for transmembrane analysis and the signal peptide was predicted using TargetIP. Multiple sequence alignments were carried out using DNAMAN software, and polygenetic relationships were inferred using the neighbour-joining method. A barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) gammaRNA-based vector was constructed as previously described byHolzbergNone(2002). cDNA fragments derived from the coding sequence and the 3' untranslated region (150bp, nt 1512-1661) and from the coding sequence (360bp, nt 729-1088) were used to construct the recombinant TaLls1-as and TaLls1-as1 plasmids, respectively. To guarantee the specificity of gene silencing, fragments that showed the highest polymorphism within the gene family and the lowest sequence similarities with other genes using a BLASTN search in the NCBI database were chosen for constructing their gammaRNA-based derivative plasmids. The plasmids that were used in the transient expression ofTaLls1were constructed as described byDouNone(2008). pUCTaLls1 was obtained by insertion of the entireTaLls1coding sequence into theXmaI- andKpnI-digested pUCBAX plasmid. pUCTaLls11-178and pUCTaLls1212-397constructs were made in a similar manner, containing the amino acid sequence of TaLls1 from positions 1 to 178 and 212 to 397, respectively. Primers for all plasmid constructions are documented inSupplementary Table 1. Infectious BSMV RNAs were prepared from each linearized plasmid byin vitrotranscription using a high-yield capped RNA transcription kit (mMESSAGE mMACHINE; Ambion). A total of 2.5 mul of each transcript, including the BSMV RNAs alpha, beta and genetically modified gamma, were combined with 42.5 mul of FES buffer (PogueNone, 1998) and inoculated into the second leaves of wheat plants by gently rubbing the surface with a gloved finger at the two-leaf stage (ScofieldNone, 2005). BSMV:TaPDS and BSMV:00 were used as controls for the BSMV infection. Mock inoculations were carried out using 1* FES buffer. Each assay consisted of 18 seedlings and was conducted at least three times. BSMV-infected wheat plants were kept in a growth chamber at 25+/-2 degrees C. The fourth leaves were further inoculated with fresh urediniospores ofPstCYR23 or CYR31 at 9 d after virus inoculation, and the plants were then maintained as described above. The phenotypes of the fourth leaves were observed and photographed 14 d after pathogen inoculation. To determine whether the silencing ofTaLls1could result in lesion mimicking, the phenotype of the BSMV-infected wheat plants withoutPstinoculation was continually observed until 6 weeks after virus inoculation. Segments of the fourth wheat leaves infected with BSMV were detached and stained with 0.5% Evans blue (Sigma Chemicals Co., St. Louis, MO, USA) as described byWangNone(2007)to identify the dead cells. Plants inoculated with BSMV:00 were used as controls. Eighteen seedlings were examined for each assay. Ten fields of view for each assay were observed, and three biological replications were performed. The cell death areas in each field were calculated with DP-BSW software, and Tukey's test was used for statistical analysis. The fourth leaves inoculated with BSMV:00, BSMV:TaLls1-as, or BSMV:TaLls1-as1 were collected at 0, 24, 48, and 120h p.i with CYR23 or CYR31 separately in addition to the mock-inoculated leaves. qRT-PCR was performed to determine the silencing efficiency ofTaLls1for each assay. The relative transcript levels of the PR protein genes (PR1, AAK60565; PR2, DQ090946; and PR5, FG618781), reactive oxygen species-related genes (catalase,TaCAT, X94352; class III superoxidase,TaPOD, TC303653), and secondary metabolite genes (TaPAL, TC294834) were also confirmed using qRT-PCR. During the interaction between the stripe rust fungus and theTaLls1-knockdown plants, fungal development and host response were observed microscopically. Wheat leaves infected with BSMV were sampled at 0, 24, 48, and 120h p.i. with stripe rust fungus. The staining and fixing of specimens were performed as described byWangNone(2007). The hyphal length of both the virulent and avirulent stripe rust pathogen during infection were viewed under differential interference contrast optics and measured using DP-BSW software, as well as the spread of the fungal growth. The autofluorescence of attacked mesophyll cells was observed to determine the necrotic cell area using a fluorescence microscope (excitation filter 485nm, dichromic mirror 510nm, barrier filter 520nm) and measured with DP-BSW software. The percentage of infection sites displaying host cell necrosis was recorded in the compatible interaction. All microscopic examinations were performed with an Olympus BX-51 microscope (Olympus Corporation, Japan). Observations of 50 infection sites on each of five randomly selected leaf segments per treatment were carried out. H2O2production was studied inTaLls1-knockdown leaves at 24h p.i. with either the virulent or avirulentPstusing 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB; Amresco, Solon, OH, USA) staining (WangNone, 2007). Standard deviations were determined and Tukey's test was used for statistical analysis. Particle bombardment assays were performed using a Bio-Rad He/1000 particle delivery system with a double-barrelled extension for overexpression ofTaLls1in tobacco leaves (DouNone, 2008). The leaves of 5-7-week-oldN. benthamianaplants were used. For the bombardment, 9mg of M-10 tungsten particles (Bio-Rad) was combined with 50 mug of empty vector and 50 mug of beta-glucuronidase (GUS) plasmid (pUCGUS) or a mixture of 50 mug of plasmids encoding the TaLls1 protein (pUCTaLls1) and 50 mug pUCGUS. The mixed tungsten particles and plasmids were prepared for 30 shots. In each shot, a mixture of 1.67 mug of empty vector and 1.67 mug of pUCGUS or 1.67 mug of pUCTaLls1 and 1.67 mug of pUCGUS were delivered into the host cell side by side via the double-barrelled gene gun. The bombarded leaves were incubated for 3 d at 28 degrees C in darkness, and subsequently stained and destained as described byDouNone(2008). For each paired shot (GUS+TaLls1 DNA versus GUS+control DNA), the log ratio number for the fusion protein was calculated for comparison with that of the control using the Wilcoxon signed-ranks test, and at least 16 pairs of shots were performedFor the particle bombardment assay in wheat leaves, the first leaves of 7-d-old Suwon 11 wheat were used. During the bombardment, the leaves were tightly placed in dishes and shot with a Bio-Rad He/1000 single-barrelled particle delivery system according to a protocol described previously (SchweizerNone, 2000;DouchkovNone, 2005;WangNone, 2012None). All of the plasmids were prepared at approximately 1 mug mul-1. Seven micrograms of GUS plasmid (pUCGUS) and 7 mug of empty vector or 7 mug pUCTaLls1 were mixed with 26.7 mul of 90mg ml-1of tungsten particles in a 1.5ml Eppendorf tube. The DNA-tungsten mixtures were prepared as described byWangNone(2012None) and 4 mul of the mixture was used for each shot. The leaves were kept at 28 degrees C in darkness for 2 d and then stained as described above for 16h and destained in 100% ethanol. Each assay consisted of seven shots and was conducted at least twice. The significant differences between the treatments were analysed with a paired samplet-test using SPSS software. The two truncated TaLls1 constructs pUCTaLls11-178and pUCTaLls1212-397, which contained the conserved Rieske [2Fe-2S] motif and the mononuclear iron-binding site, were tested individually in tobacco and wheat, as well as pUCTaLls1. The fourth leaves of the BSMV-infected plants were sampled 14 d after inoculation and pheophorbideawas extracted according to the method described byPruzinskaNone(2005). Following the procedure as described (RocaNone, 2004;JiangNone, 2007), pheophorbideawas determined by reverse-phase HPLC (HPLC/Waters 600 controller) equipped with a Diamonsil C18 5 mum (150 mm*4.6mm) column and Waters 2487 dual lambda absorbance detector. The RCCs of theTaLls1-overexpressing wheat leaves by particle bombardment were extracted according to the method described byPruzinskaNone(2007). Analysis of variance and Tukey's test for statistical analysis were performed using SAS software 9.13. A fragment of 669bp from a wheat-Pstincompatible interaction cDNA library was isolated. BLASTX analysis revealed a 669bp 3'-end cDNA fragment with high similarity to theZea mays lethal leaf-spot 1gene (ZmLls1, GenBank Accession No. AAC49676.1). Subsequently a 1633bp 5'-end cDNA fragment was amplified by 5'-RACE and a full-length 1926bp cDNA fragment in size was obtained using the CAP3 Sequence Assembly Program and was designatedTaLls1. TargetP analysis indicated a chloroplast-targeting peptide at the N terminus, which was cleaved between aa 47 and 48 (R/V). In addition, a transmembrane helix from aa 490 to 511 was predicted by the TMpred program. The structural analysis of TaLls1 revealed a conserved Rieske [2Fe-2S] iron-sulphur motif, a mononuclear non-heme iron-binding motif, and a C-terminal CxxC motif. Alignment of TaLls1 with the Lls1 homologue from other species indicated that Lls1 proteins are conserved in mono- and dicotyledonous plants although residues at the N terminus were highly polymorphic (Fig. 1A). Multi-sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis of TaLls1 and other members of the PaO family. (A) Multiple alignment of amino acids. Identical and similar amino acid residues are shaded in black and light grey, respectively. The arrow indicates the cleavage site of the chloroplast peptide; Motif A, indicated by a single line, is the Rieske iron-binding motif; Motif B, indicated by a double line, is the mononuclear iron-binding site; Motif C, indicated by a dashed line, is the conserved CxxC sequence.

Phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1B) revealed that TaLls1 homologous proteins from monocotyledonous plants were assembled in a large clade in which TaLls1 and BdPao were tightly clustered and OsPaO and ZmLls1 were assembled into the other tight cluster. Homologous proteins from dicotyledonous plants were clustered into another two large groups. The close relationship between TaLls1, OsPao, and ZmLls1 suggested a similar function for these genes. To determine the expression profiles ofTaLls1, we examined the transcript ofTaLls1in different wheat tissues. qRT-PCR analyses revealed its abundance in green leaf, and showed that the level was twofold lower in the stem and flower than in the leaves (Fig. 2). TaLls1expression was also detectable in wheat seeds and roots although at relatively low levels, about 15 and 49 times lower than that in the leaf. Expression pattern ofTaLls1in different wheat tissues. Samples were collected from leaves, stems, roots, seeds, and flowers. Three independent biological replications were performed. Expression levels were normalized toTaEF-1a. Asterisks indicate a significant difference (P less than 0.05) from the leaf using Student'st-test. We further examined the expression level ofTaLls1in response to various abiotic and biotic stresses. The transcript level ofTaLls1increased twofold 6h after wounding treatment and reached a maximum of about threefold higher than that of the control at 12h (Fig. 3A). Under cold treatments, the expression ofTaLls1significantly decreased from 6 to 12h and then increased again to a normal level (Fig. 3A). Expression profiles ofTaLls1in response to abiotic stresses (A), exogenous hormones (B), and pathogen attack (C). Expression levels were normalized to the wheat elongation factorTaEF-1agene. Results are shown as means +/-standard deviation of three biological replications. Asterisks indicate a significant difference (P less than 0.05) from 0h p.t. or 0h p.i. using Student'st-test. ABA, abscisic acid; SA, salicylic acid; ETH, ethylene; MeJA, methyl jasmonate. We also assayedTaLls1expression in wheat leaves treated the exogenous hormones salicylic acid, ethylene, methyl jasmonate, and abscisic acid. As shown inFig. 3B,TaLls1transcription was transiently upregulated twofold at 6h p.t., with a gradual decrease from 12 to 24h p.t., and finally returned to a normal level at 48h p.t. following abscisic acid treatment. In contrast, salicylic acid, ethylene, and methyl jasmonate treatments did not cause significant changes in the expression level ofTaLls1(Fig. 3B). During the wheat-Pstinteractions, the transcription level ofTaLls1was sharply induced at 12h p.i. in wheat leaves challenged by the avirulentPstrace CYR23, reaching a level that was threefold higher than that of the control plants (Fig. 3C). In wheat leaves challenged by the virulentPstrace CYR31, the level of theTaLls1transcription did not change significantly (Fig. 3C). In order to get more details of the role ofTaLls1in wheat resistance toPst, virus-induced gene silencing was used to silence the expression ofTaLls1during the wheat-Pstinteraction. Mild chlorotic mosaic symptoms appeared on the fourth leaves at 9 d p.i. in all plants that were inoculated with BSMV (Fig. 4A), and the BSMV:TaPDS-inoculated plants exhibited strong photobleaching symptoms (Fig. 4A), suggesting that the BSMV virus-induced gene silencing system worked well. No obvious disease phenotypic changes were observed on wheat leaves from theTaLls1-knockdown plants inoculated withPstrace CYR23 or CYR31 when compared with the wild-type plants (Fig. 4B). A typical HR was observed on the CYR23-infected leaves, and all leaves challenged by CYR31 exhibited a fully susceptible phenotype. These results suggested that knockdown ofTaLls1was unable to alter the resistance or susceptibility phenotype of Suwon 11 toPst. Functional analyses ofTaLls1during the interaction between wheat and stripe rust using a BSMV-mediated virus-induced gene silencing system. (A) Mild chlorotic mosaic symptoms were observed on the fourth leaves of seedlings at 9 d p.i. with BSMV, and photobleaching was evident on the fourth leaves of plants infected with BSMV:TaPDS.

(C) Silencing efficiency assessment ofTaLls1in the fourth leaves ofTaLls1-knockdown plants during a compatible interaction. Wheat leaves inoculated with BSMV:00 and sampled after inoculation with CYR23 were used as the controls. Data were normalized to theTaEF-1aexpression level. Error bars represent variations among three independent replicates. Asterisks indicate a significant difference (P less than 0.05) from BSMV:00 using Student'st-test. (This figure is available in colour atJXBonline.) To clarify whetherTaLls1was successfully silenced, qRT-PCR was carried out on RNA extracted from the fourth leaves ofTaLls1-knockdown plants. As shown inFig. 4CandSupplementary Fig. S1(atJXBonline), the abundance ofTaLls1transcripts was greatly reduced to different extents inTaLls1-knockdown plants when compared with the control. Because no macroscopic phenotype changes in response to avirulent or virulent races ofPstwere observed inTaLls1-knockdown wheat, we further studied the fungal development and host response duringPstinfection through histological observations (Fig. 5). As shown inTable 1, the fungal hyphal length of CYR31 inTaLls1-knockdown plants was statistically (P greater than 0.05) similar to the control as well as to that ofPstCYR23 (Supplementary Table S2atJXBonline). Additionally, the area infected by the pathogen at 120h p.i. also showed no significant difference betweenTaLls1-knockdown plants and the control (Table 1,Supplementary Table S2).

Histological observations during the compatible interaction between the stripe rust fungus andTaLls1-knockdown wheat plants. Significance was measured according to a paired samplet-test method (different lower-case letters indicate a significant difference: b*,P less than 0.01; b,P less than 0.05). NoneWheat leaves pre-infected with BSMV: 00 or the recombinant BSMV: TaLls1-as and BSMV: TaLls1-as1 followed by inoculation withPstCYR31 in the compatible interaction. NoneThe average distance from the junction of the substomatal vesicle and the hyphal tip calculated from at least 50 infection sites (*10 mum). NoneThe average infected area of expanding hyphae plus the host cells calculated from at least 50 infection sites (*1000 mum2). NoneThe amount of H2O2production was identified by DAB staining and measured by calculating the area of H2O2produced in at least 50 infection sites (*100 mum2). NoneRatio of cell death at the infection sites counted from at least 50 infection sites. To analyse the host response, we measured the cell death areas per infection site at 120h p.i. in the incompatible interaction and determined the percentage of cell deaths resulting from successful infections in relation to the compatible interaction. In compatible controls, cell death was seldom observed around the infection sites, but inTaLls1-knockdown plants, the occurrence of necrotic cells that were caused by pathogen infection increased by approximately threefold (Table 1). In the incompatible interaction, the average cell death areas were 1.5-2-fold higher than those of the control (Supplementary Table S2). These results indicated that knockdown ofTaLls1resulted in an increase in the occurrence and area of cell death duringPstinfection. To confirm that the increase in cell death was involved in the resistance response, we examined the expression of PR proteins inTaLls1-knockdown plants by qRT-PCR. The expression ofPR1andPR2was induced significantly in bothTaLls1-knockdown plants when challenged by the virulent CYR31 race (Fig. 6) as well as the avirulent CYR23 (Supplementary Fig. S2atJXBonline). In contrast, the expression ofPR5showed no significant induction (Fig. 6,Supplementary Fig. S2). In additional, the expression level of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), a defence-related gene, was dramatically upregulated as early as 24h p.i. in both the compatible (Fig. 6) and incompatible (Supplementary Fig. S2) interactions. These results indicated that knockdown ofTaLls1enhanced the tolerance of wheat toPstto some degree but was insufficient to change the interaction type. Transcriptional changes in defence-related genes inTaLls1-knockdown wheat seedlings using qRT-PCR. Leaves infected with BSMV:00 or the recombinant BSMV:00gamma-infected seedlings were sampled at 0, 24, 48, and 120h p.i. Expression levels were normalized to theTaEF-1agene. Error bars represent the variation among three independent replicates. Asterisks indicate a significant difference (P less than 0.05) from 0h p.i. using Student'st-test. To further clarify the resistance response inTaLls1-knockdown plants, H2O2accumulation was detected by DAB staining. The results showed that H2O2accumulation was almost doubled inTaLls1-knockdown seedlings compared with that in the control plants at 24h p.i. in the compatible interaction (Fig. 5a,A), and the amount of H2O2generated inTaLls1-as knockdown plants (Table 1) was almost comparable to that of the incompatible interaction (Supplementary Table S2). The increased amounts of H2O2were accompanied by transient expression of catalase (CAT) and superoxidase (POD) (Fig. 6), which might remove the excessive production of H2O2. PaO has been reported to be a cell death suppressor inArabidopsisand maize (GrayNone, 1997;PruzinskaNone, 2003). To confirm its role in cell death in wheat, we carried out transcriptional suppression ofTaLls1in wheat plants withoutPstinfection. As shown inFig. 4A, the fourth leaves ofTaLls1-knockdown seedlings exhibited mild chlorotic mosaic symptoms but no lesion formation. From the fourth leaves to the seventh leaves, mild chlorotic mosaic symptoms were constantly observed and no lesion-mimic formation was detected. Although no macroscopic lesion formations were observed, cell death was detected by Evans blue staining, whereby the dead cells were stained dark blue. The fourth leaves infected with recombinant BSMV showed a darker blue staining than those infected with BSMV:00 (Fig. 7A). Microscopic observation of the stained leaf segments revealed more dead cells stained dark blue in leaves infected with BSMV:TaLls1-as (Fig. 7C) and BSMV: TaLls1-as1(Fig. 7D) than those infected with BSMV:00 (Fig. 7B). Statistics analyses revealed that the average area of cell death in each field of view indicated by Evans blue staining inTaLls1-knockdown plants was one- to threefold greater than that in the control plants (Table 2).

Besides the knockdown ofTaLls1, we also investigated the involvement ofTaLls1in cell death regulation through transient expression in tobacco by particle bombardment. BecauseGUSis expressed only in living cells, fewer blue GUS spots indicate more cell death. On the half of tobacco leaves that were co-bombarded with GUS and empty vectors, numerous blue spots were observed (Fig. 8A), representing living tobacco cells. On the other half of tobacco leaves that were co-bombarded with GUS and TaLls1 vectors, much fewer GUS spots were observed (Fig. 8A), with a reduction of approximately 70% (Table 3), indicating that more cell death had occurred. Overexpression ofTaLls1triggers cell death inN. benthamianaleaves andT. aestivumleaves through particle bombardment assay. (A-C) Transient expression ofTaLls1inN. benthamianaleaves using double-barrelled particle bombardment. Leaves were bombarded with the pairs of DNA mixtures indicated.

Statistical analysis of results from 14 shots was conducted for each assay. EV, empty vector. (This figure is available in colour atJXBonline.) Induction of PCD by transient expression of TaLls1. NoneBarrels 1 and 2 were physically identical and the masses of DNA in each barrel were identical. All of the replicates were conducted on the petiole-proximal half of the leaves and then the petiole-distal half. EV, empty vector. NoneRatios of blue spots that were counted in each barrel. Geometric averages and standard error were calculated from log ratios obtained from 16 pairs of shots. NoneThePvalue for the direct comparison was calculated from the log ratios using a Wilcoxon signed-ranks test. A significantPvalue indicates that cell death was induced by TaLls1. To learn more about the mechanism of cell death induced byTaLls1, we studied the activities of the two conserved motifs in TaLls1. The results (Table 3) showed that overexpression of PUCTaLls11-178, which contains the conserved Rieske [2Fe-2S] binding motif, induced cell death with a 68.9% reduction in GUS blue spots (Fig. 8B), whereas overexpression of PUCTaLls1212-397, including the mononuclear iron-binding motif, failed to induce cell death (Fig. 8C). The transient expression of exogenous genes in tobacco has been widely used to study their role in cell death, but questions still remain, such as to what extent different plant species share similar cell death regulation mechanisms. Thus, we further studied the role ofTaLls1in cell death by the one-barrel co-bombardment system in wheat leaves. As shown inFig. 8D, blue spots on the leaves that were co-bombarded with GUS and PUCTaLls1 or TaLls11-178were significantly lower than in the control leaves (Supplementary Table S3atJXBonline), which is consistent with the results observed in tobacco leaves. On the other hand, overexpression of TaLls1212-397in wheat leaves did not affect the number of blue spots as shown in tobacco leaves. Recent reports have shown that defects inPaOin theArabidopsis acd1mutant and the maizells1mutant result in accumulation of pheophorbideain leaves (PruzinskaNone, 2003;TanakaNone, 2003). HPLC analyses revealed that pheophorbideaaccumulated to a concentration of 1.13 nmol g-1and 0.99 nmol g-1of fresh weight inTaLls1-as- andTaLls1-as1-knockdown plants, respectively, while it could not be detected in leaves infected with BSMV:00 or BSMV:TaPDS (Fig. 9A), suggesting that the accumulation of pheophorbideawas due to the downregulation ofTaLls1. Determination of pheophorbideainTaLls1-knockdown plants and RCCs inTaLls1-overexpressing leaves. (A) Pheophorbideadetermination inTaLls1-knockdown plants by HPLC. The fourth leaves of the plants infected with recombinant BSMV were sampled at 14 d p.i. to determine the pheophorbideaconcentration. Significant accumulation of pheophorbideawas detected in plants infected with BSMV:TaLls1-as (as) and BSMV:TaLls1-as1 (as1), while none was detected in wheat plants inoculated with FES buffer (CK), BSMV:00 (gamma) or BSMV:TaPDS (PDS). (B) RCC determination in wheat leaves overexpressingTaLls1. Methanol extracts of theTaLls1-overexpressing leaves exhibited deeper red compared with the leaves bombarded with empty vector (EV) and the healthy wild-type leaves (CK). (This figure is available in colour atJXBonline.) Defects inRCCRin theArabidopsis acd2mutant result in accumulation of RCCs accompanied by increased transcription ofPaO(PruzinskaNone, 2007). It is presumed that RCCs accumulate inTaLls1-overexpressing wheat leaves. We found that RCC extracts fromTaLls1-overexpressing leaves were a deeper red compared with the control leaves and leaves bombarded with empty vector (Fig. 9B), as observed inRCCR1irice plants (TangNone, 2011). Thus, we assumed that the deep red colour was due to the accumulation of RCCs. In the present study, we have reported on the identification and functional analysis of a novel wheatLls1gene, which is homologous to PaO in maize andArabidopsis. ZmLls1was wound inducible in maize (YangNone, 2004), and our qRT-PCR results also indicated the induction ofTaLls1upon wounding treatment. Giridhar and Thimann (1985)reported that wounding promotes chlorophyll loss in oat leaves, so we inferred that the elevatedTaLls1expression is responsible for the quick removal of chlorophyll in damaged cells. As for the decreased expression ofTaLls1under cold treatments, this may be associated with dampened PaO activity in the breakdown of chlorophyll. During seed development in canola, freezing delays the degradation of chlorophyll due to a reduced PaO activity (ChungNone, 2006). Our data suggest a regulated activity ofTaLls1in response to abiotic stresses, which may be related to its catalytic activity in chlorophyll breakdown. During chlorophyll breakdown, chlorophyll is degraded to safe linear tetrapyrroles through a series of reactions catalysed by chlorophyllase, magnesium dechelatase, and PaO. PaO catalyses the oxygenic ring opening of pheophorbideabetween C4 and C5 to RCCs (PruzinskaNone, 2003,2005;TanakaNone, 2003). To clarify whether TaLls1 has this oxygenase activity, we assessed the content of pheophorbideainTaLls1-knockdown plants. HPLC analyses revealed that pheophorbideaaccumulated due to the silencing ofTaLls1inTaLls1-knockdown plants, implying thatTaLls1has PaO activity. Accompanied by the accumulation of pheophorbidea, silencing ofTaLls1caused a significant increase in cell death, indicating a cell death suppressor role ofTaLls1, as observed forZmLls1mutants (GrayNone, 1997) andArabidopsis acd1mutants (HirashimaNone, 2009). It has been reported that pheophorbidea,the substrate of PaO, accumulates and generates reactive oxygen species under light conditions, which lead to cell death (PruzinskaNone, 2003,2005;TanakaNone, 2003). Thus, we infer that, inTaLls1-knockdown plants, the reduced activity of TaLls1 resulted in the accumulation of pheophorbidea, which would induce further cell death owing to the simulated H2O2production. However, despite this phototoxic feature, pheophorbideahas been assumed to specifically inhibit the activity of channel proteins or other cellular components that are essential for membrane integrity and to cause the destruction of membrane systems (HirashimaNone, 2009). In addition, pheophorbideahas also been postulated to function as a signal molecule that regulates gene expression and induces programmes cell death (HirashimaNone, 2009). Therefore, in this study, we confirmed the cell death suppressor role of TaLls1, but the detailed mechanism of the cell death caused by pheophorbideaneeds to be investigated further. Different from the lesion-mimic phenotype observed inZmLls1mutants,TaLls1silencing was insufficient to cause visible necrosis inTaLls1-knockdown plants, which may due to the complicated regulatory mechanisms of plant cell death. In addition, the deficiency caused byTaLls1silencing may be complemented by other genes with a similar function in wheat or genes from other pathways. Nevertheless,TaLls1was demonstrated to partially contribute to cell death in wheat. AlthoughZmLls1,AtAcd1, andOsPAOpotentially are cell death suppressors according to the results of mutant and silencing assays (GrayNone, 1997;PruzinskaNone, 2003;TangNone, 2011), there is still no direct overexpression evidence for its role in cell death. Interestingly, in this study, the transient expression ofTaLls1also could induce cell death in both tobacco and wheat leaves instead of a cell death suppressor. In order to further determine the cause of this, we assessed the content of RCCs, which are the product of PaO, and found an accumulation of RCCs in wheat leaves overexpressingTaLls1. Previous studies have indicated that accumulation of RCCs is responsible for cell death inacd2mutant andOsRCCRirice plants (PruzinskaNone, 2007;TangNone, 2011). In addition, H2O2is generated together with the accumulation of RCCs, which play an important role inacd2-induced cell death (Yao and Greenberg, 2006). Thus, we inferred that it was H2O2generation by RCC accumulation that induced cell death inTaLls1-overexpressing wheat leaves. Here, our findings provide direct evidence of the correlation between cell death and PaO. Taken together, the cell death induction activity ofTaLls1in eitherTaLls1-knockdown plants or transient overexpressing leaf tissues demonstrated the close relationship of cell death and H2O2accumulation caused by the chlorophyll degradation catabolites resulting from the irregular TaLls1 activity. It appears that there is a threshold forTaLls1in maintaining the balance of chlorophyll catabolism and cell homeostasis. In sum,TaLls1seems to serve as a type of rheostat for cell death regulation in plants subjected to various stresses. A deletion mutational analysis of the conserved structures revealed that Rieske [2Fe-2S] is responsible for cell death induction, while the mononuclear non-heme iron-binding domain was not. Previous reports have demonstrated that both the Rieske [2Fe-2S] and mononuclear non-heme iron-binding domains are essential for PaO catalytic activity (FerraroNone, 2005), during which the electrons transfer from the Rieske domain to the active sites and subsequently activate the PaO activity (GrayNone, 2004). For the both truncated TaLls1 forms (TaLls1212-397and TaLls1212-397), the oxygenase catalytic activity was unable to be activated. Thereby, we presume that it is not only the catalytic activity of TaLls1 that caused the induced cell death but other roles of TaLls1 produced by Rieske [2Fe-2S]. With the exception of their function as electron carriers in the photosynthetic electron transport chain and as electron donors to various cellular proteins, the iron-sulphur clusters were also found to serve a variety of biological functions, including regulatory and structural roles (BeinertNone, 1997). In the redox-sensing SoxR protein, the FeS centres allosterically link cellular oxidative stress to the expression of defence-related genes (HidalgoNone, 1997). It has also been reported that the [2Fe-2S] cluster-binding site is involved in mitochondrial morphology and suppression of cell proliferation (MurataNone, 2011). Taken together, we speculate that the cell death induction activity may be related to other functions of TaLls1, such as a signal molecule in the cell death pathway or an electron transporter for other enzymes involved in cell death, rather than breaking down pheophorbideaalone. After confirming the linkage betweenTaLls1and cell death, we further studied the role ofTaLls1in the wheat-Pstinteraction. TaLls1was upregulated with the avirulentPstpathogen infection at 12h p.i., when the pathogen had not yet formed haustoria (WangNone, 2007). Our result is consistent with the induced expression of theLls1gene in the cowpea and cowpea rust interaction (MouldNone, 2003). These authors demonstrated that upregulation of PaO during the cowpea and cowpea rust interaction may reflect an anticipation of chlorophyll degradation related to HR (MouldNone, 2003). For the wheat-Pstinteraction,WangNone(2007)reported that H2O2rapidly increased at infection sites 12h after inoculation of avirulentPstbefore HR, so we postulated that the early increase inTaLls1in the incompatible interaction is associated with the generation of H2O2at an early stage of HR initiation. To get more information on the role ofTaLls1in the wheat-Pstinteraction,TaLls1was silenced through a BSMV-mediated gene silencing system. TheTaLls1-knockdown plants exhibited no detectable change in disease symptoms, but did show a significant increase in cell death uponPstinfection. Generally, elevated cell death occurrence at the infection sites was proposed to inhibit the spread of pathogen infection, but growth of the virulentPstCYR31 did not significantly change inTaLls1-knockdown plants in comparison with the control plants. It is reasonable to speculate that silencing ofTaLls1is able to increase cell death caused byPstinfection but insufficient to limitPstgrowth. Aside from the significant upregulation ofPR1,PR2, andPALin response toPstinfection in theTaLls1-knockdown plants, theTaLls1-knockdown plants exhibited a sharply increased accumulation of H2O2at the early stage of the virulent pathogen infection. Notably, the amounts of H2O2generated inTaLls1-knockdown leaves in the compatible interaction reached approximately the same level as in the incompatible interactions, which is sufficient to trigger local cell death. During the interaction between wheat and the avirulentPst, H2O2generation in the early infection stage is associated with the occurrence of HR and the resistance response (WangNone, 2007). Therefore, we assume that knockdown ofTaLls1is likely to result in HR elicitation during the compatible interaction at the early stage. Additionally, catalase and superoxidase are subsequently upregulated to eliminate the excessive H2O2, and the removal of H2O2may lead to the failure of HR initiation. Hence,TaLls1-knockdown plants seemed to be susceptible to the virulentPst. When combined with the induced cell death and elevated expression levels of defence-related genes, it is reasonable to assume that silencing ofTaLls1enhanced the tolerance of wheat toPstbut was not sufficient to alter the disease symptoms. In conclusion, the present study revealed a self-regulation ofTaLls1in balancing cell death and a negative role in wheat disease tolerance toPst, but it is not clear how they are related. Further studies ofTaLls1-modulated HR resistance toPstare needed with transgenic wheat plants.
