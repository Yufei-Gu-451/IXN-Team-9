The prevalence of diabetes mellitus is steadily increasing worldwide. Currently, diabetes mellitus affects 25.8 million people in the U.S. Diabetic retinopathy is the most common cause of diabetes mellitus complications and the leading cause of new cases of blindness among adults aged 20-74 years. Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is the most severe vision-threatening complication of diabetes mellitus (1,2). Ischemia-induced angiogenesis and expansion of extracellular matrix in association with neovascularization are the pathological hallmarks in PDR. Neovascularization can ultimately result in vitreous hemorrhage and tractional retinal detachment, producing severe and often irreversible vision loss (3,4). Previous studies demonstrate that severe diabetic retinopathy aggregates in families (5), suggesting that genetic susceptibilities contribute to disease development. However, only a few genes, such asVEGFandEPO, have been identified to be associated with PDR to date (2,6). Transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2[also known asTCF4]) is a key component in the Wnt-signaling pathway, which regulates fundamental processes such as vascular development and has been found to mediate pathological neovascularization in proliferative retinopathy (4,7). Common variant rs7903146 inTCF7L2has been reported to be strongly associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and this finding has been replicated in many studies (8,9). It was reported in some small studies thatTCF7L2gene is linked with microvascular and macrovascular complications, such as diabetic retinopathy (10), but the mechanism remains unclear. Here, we investigated the role ofTCF7L2in PDR using a genetic association study and by analyzing the expression ofTCF7L2andVEGFAin human lymphoblastoid cells, ARPE-19 cells, and oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) mice. This study was approved by the institutional review boards of University of California, San Diego, and West China Hospital. All subjects gave informed consent prior to participation. A two-stage approach was performed for this study. In stage one, 209 T2DM patients with PDR (T2DM-PDR) and 442 T2DM patients without diabetic retinopathy (T2DM-no DR) were used as a discovery cohort. In stage two, 174 T2DM-PDR and 314 T2DM-no DR patients served as the replication cohort. All patients were of European descent. The control subjects were defined as having no retinopathy and having T2DM for a minimum of 15 years. Characteristics of participants in the study are listed inSupplementary Table 1. To investigate whetherTCF7L2is also associated with PDR in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), 372 T1DM-PDR and 417 T1DM-no DR Caucasian patients were studied. The control subjects were defined as having no retinopathy and having T1DM for a minimum of 15 years. Participants underwent detailed eye examinations using the Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) protocol with seven-standard-field stereoscopic fundus photography. Retinopathy status was determined by evaluation of fundus photographs and graded according to clinical ETDRS criteria. Patients with any disk neovascularization, neovascularization elsewhere, vitreous hemorrhage, fibrovascular proliferation, or tractional retinal detachment were considered to have PDR. Retinopathy grading was performed without prior knowledge of genotypes. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes with a Qiagen kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. rs7903146 (C/T) inTCF7L2was genotyped using single-nucleotide primer extension assay (ABI Prism SNaPShot Multiplex kit; Applied Biosystems) on an ABI 3130xl genetic analyzer as previously described (11). The primers used for genotyping are listed inSupplementary Table 2. The human lymphoblastoid cell lines were generated by the method "general protocol for the immortalization of human B-lymphocytes using EBV" (http://www.unclineberger.org/tissueculture/protocols/b-lymphocytesprotocol). Nine lymphoblastoid cell lines with the genotypes ofTCF7L2rs7903146-CC and another nine with the genotypes ofTCF7L2rs7903146-TT were used. The cells were cultured in RPMI base medium (61870127; Invitrogen) supplemented with 20% FBS and 1*Penicillin-Streptomycin (P0781; Sigma). On the day before treatment, the cells were diluted to ?2 * 105/mL. On the day of treatment, tunicamycin (T7765; Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 10 ug/mL. RNA was extracted at 12 h posttreatment. The total mRNA levels ofTCF7L2andVEGFAwere measured by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). For monitoring for endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in human lymphoblastoid cell lines, RNA expression of XBP1 isoforms was used as a positive marker (12). Retinal pigment epithelium ARPE-19 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 (1:1) base medium (11320; GIBCO) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1*Penicillin-Streptomycin (P0781; Sigma) and 1*MEM NEAA (11140; GIBCO). Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) sets in pLKO.1 clones againstTCF7L2(NM_030756.1) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. ARPE-19 cells were infected with control lentivirus or lentivirus-mediatedTCF7L2shRNA. RNA was extracted at 48 h posttreatment. The total mRNA levels ofTCF7L2andVEGFAwere measured by qRT-PCR. DNMT1(DNA methyltransferase 1) gene was used as a control gene to test whether there are off-target effects for the shRNA in our study. Retinal neovascularization was produced in C57BL/6 mice by placing postnatal day 7 (P7) mice and their mothers in an atmosphere of 75 +/- 3% oxygen for 5 days (13). Oxygen concentration was automatically monitored and controlled by an oxygen controller (BioSpherix). At P12, the mice were returned to room air for 5 days. At P17, the mice were killed and the retinas were removed. Total RNA was isolated from the retinas of OIR mice and littermate controls. TCF7L2andVEGFAmRNA levels were measured by real-time qRT-PCR. Total RNA extraction from mouse tissues or human lymphoblastoid cells, cDNA synthesis, and qRT-PCR experiments were performed as previously described (14). Assays were performed in triplicate. Relative mRNA levels were calculated by normalizing results usingGAPDHand then compared with tissues from wild-type littermates or untreated human lymphoblastoid cells. The primers used for qRT-PCR are listed inSupplementary Table 2. Retinal protein extracts were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer with a mixture of protease inhibitors (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The total protein concentration was quantified by BCA protein assay (15). Twenty micrograms of total protein were used for blotting with anti-phosphorylated (p)-eukaryotic initiation factor (p-eIF2)alpha (Ser51) (Cell Signaling Technology, Boston, MA). The same membrane was stripped and reblotted with an anti-beta-actin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as internal control. The intensities of Western blot bands were quantified using the Multi Gauge, version 3.0 software (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). Logistic regression analysis was used to compare the difference between the T2DM-PDR and T2DM-no DR groups. SNP genotyping results were screened for deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium using chi2tests. The differences in quantitative PCR data were analyzed with independent two-samplettest. Covariable analysis was done by SPSS software. Statistical significance was defined asP less than 0.05. Pearson correlation coefficient was used to calculate the correlation betweenTCF7L2andVEGFA(16). We performed genetic association study and genotyped a candidate geneTCF7L2variant rs7903146 in T2DM-PDR case and T2DM-no DR control subjects. Information on demographics of case and control groups is presented inSupplementary Table 1. While there were no significant differences between the T2DM-PDR and T2DM-no DR groups with regard to sex, there was a statistically significant difference in age and BMI between the two groups (P less than 0.05). The lower BMI was observed in the T2DM-no DR group. In the discovery cohort, the T risk allele frequency of rs7903146 inTCF7L2was significantly higher in patients with PDR (T2DM-PDR, 40.4%) than in patients without diabetic retinopathy (T2DM-no DR, 33.3%) (allelicP= 0.016). We replicated this association in a second T2DM cohort. In this replication cohort, the T-allele frequency of rs7903146 was also significantly higher in T2DM-PDR (42.0%) than in T2DM-no DR (33.4%) (allelicP= 0.008). Together, a combined analysis showed that the risk allele (T) of rs7903146 was strongly associated with T2DM-PDR (allelicP= 2.52E-04, odds ratio [OR] 1.40 [95% CI 1.16-1.68]). After adjustment for BMI, the risk allele (T) of rs7903146 remained significantly associated with T2DM-PDR (adjusted allelicP= 1.06E-03; OR 1.37 [1.14-1.65]). (Table 1). Genotype and association results ofTCF7L2-rs7903146 in patients with T2DM-PDR and T2DM-no DRTo test whether this positive association can also be applied to a T1DM population, we genotyped 372 T1DM-PDR patients and 417 T1DM-no DR patients. There is no significant difference for the frequency of rs7903146 T allele between T1DM-PDR (28.0%) and T1DM-no DR (30.3%) (allelicP= 0.300) (Supplementary Table 3). ER stress, which can be induced with tunicamycin, has been linked to vascular abnormalities in diabetes (17). We therefore tested whether treating human lymphoblastoid cells with tunicamycin could alter gene expression profiles ofTCF7L2andVEGFA. After treating human lymphoblastoid cells with tunicamycin, we observed a significantly higher fold change of mRNA levels ofTCF7L2in cells with aTCF7L2rs7903146-TT risk genotype (P= 0.02) (Fig. 1None). Similarly, we observed increased fold change of mRNA level ofVEGFAin cells with an rs7903146-TT risk genotype (P= 0.004) (Fig. 1None). There was also a positive correlation between the fold change of the expression ofTCF7L2andVEGFAin tunicamycin-treated cells (Pearsonr= 0.8663) (Fig. 1None). Quantitative gene expression ofVEGFAandTCF7L2in tunicamycin-treated lymphoblastoid cells. A: Compared with that in untreated cells, theTCF7L2mRNA level in tunicamycin-treated cells was 1.31 +/- 0.18-fold higher with an rs7903146-CC genotype and 2.68 +/- 0.54-fold higher with an rs7903146-TT (P= 0.02). B: TheVEGFAmRNA level in tunicamycin-treated cells was 2.66 +/- 0.60-fold higher in rs7903146-CC cells than that in untreated cells and 6.09 +/- 0.86-fold higher in rs7903146-TT cells than that in untreated cells (P= 0.004). C: The fold change ofVEGFAmRNA level correlated well with that ofTCF7L2mRNA level, Pearsonr= 0.8663. We did not observe a significant difference in the total expression levels ofTCF7L2in the cell lines with an rs7903146-CC or rs7903146-TT genotype at the baseline or after tunicamycin treatment (at baseline,P= 0.853; after tunicamycin treatment,P= 0.390) (Supplementary Fig. 1None). Similarly, there was no significant difference in the total expression level ofVEGFAin cell lines with an rs7903146-CC or rs7903146-TT genotype at the baseline (P= 0.927). However, there was a significant higher expression ofVEGFAin the cell lines with rs7903146-TT than in rs7903146-CC after tunicamycin treatment (P= 0.004) (Supplementary Fig. 1None). There was no correlation between total transcripts ofTCF7L2andVEGFAwithout calculation of fold change (Pearsonr= -0.1) (Supplementary Fig. 1None). The changes in gene expression mentioned above were not due to alterations in the present experimental conditions, as the level of a housekeeping gene (GAPDH) remained the same throughout the experiment (Supplementary Fig. 1None) and was used for normalization ofTCF7L2andVEGFAexpression in fold change calculations. In the cells treated with tunicamycin, ER stress was induced as shown by alternative splicing ofXBP1. Two bands (unspliced and spliced band) were detected for the tunicamycin-treated cells (Supplementary Fig. 2). To validate the role ofTCF7L2in modulation ofVEGFAexpression, we performed an RNA silencing experiment by knocking down the expression ofTCF7L2in ARPE-19, and we observed concomitant 66% reduction ofVEGFAmRNA level (P less than 0.001) (Fig. 2). Quantitative gene expression ofTCF7L2andVEGFAafter silencing by TCF7L2-shRNA in ARPE-19 cells (n= 3). ARPE-19 cells infected with TCF7L2-shRNA lentivirus had a 92% decrease inTCF7L2gene expression and 66% decrease inVEGFAcompared with cells infected with control-shRNA lentivirus (P less than 0.001). **P less than 0.001. For testing of whether there were off-target effects by shRNA,DNMT1was used as an endogenous control in our study. The results showed that the expression ofDNMT1gene remained the same before or after shRNA treatment (Supplementary Fig. 3). OIR mice model has been used extensively to study retinal ischemia and PDR. We measured mRNA levels in retinas from the OIR model. TCF7L2andVEGFAmRNA expression was significantly higher in retinas from OIR mice compared with controls (P= 2.90E-04 forTCF7L2;P= 1.90E-07 forVEGFA) (Fig. 3). The expression of p-eIF2alpha, a positive marker for ER stress, was significantly upregulated in OIR mice retinas (1.72 +/- 0.22-fold) (Supplementary Fig. 4). Quantitative gene expression ofTCF7L2andVEGFAin OIR mouse retinas (n= 9). Compared with those in controls, OIR mice retinas had higherTCF7L2mRNA expression (P= 2.90E-04) andVEGFAmRNA expression (P= 1.90E-07). **P less than 0.001. TCF7L2is the most significant susceptibility gene for T2DM thus far identified (9,18). However, the association betweenTCF7L2and diabetic retinopathy has been conflicting (10,19). The discordant results in these studies may be due to a small sample size or the lack of distinction between the two stages of diabetic retinopathy: nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) and PDR. There are patients with NPDR who never progress to PDR despite poor glycemic control and long-standing diabetes, suggesting that there may be genetic factors predisposing patients to the development of PDR from NPDR. Our study therefore differentiates from other prior studies by taking the most extreme diabetic retinopathy phenotype (most severe phenotype). Here, we found thatTCF7L2-rs7903146 is associated not only with T2DM (Supplementary Table 4) but also with PDR in Caucasian patients with T2DM. The allele (T) of rs7903146 is the same risk allele for T2DM-PDR as well as T2DM. In patients with PDR, the expression ofVEGFAis markedly upregulated (20). In our OIR study, the expression of bothTCF7L2andVEGFAwas found to be significantly higher compared with controls. These findings provide evidence that TCF7L2, a key component of the Wnt-signaling pathway, plays an important role in pathological neovascularization. ER stress pathway has been linked to vascular abnormalities in diabetes and diabetic retinopathy (17,21). VEGFAis one of the target genes ofTCF7L2(22). To study whether ER stress played a role inTCF7L2andVEGFAexpression, we tested the expression ofTCF7L2andVEGFAin the tunicamycin-treated lymphoblastoid cell lines stratified with genotypes of rs7903146. We showed that after treatment of human lymphoblastoid cells with tunicamycin, a more significant increase inTCF7L2andVEGFAexpression was observed in cells with an rs7903146 TT risk allele than in those with a nonrisk CC allele (P= 0.02 andP= 0.004, respectively). There are twoTCF7L2-binding sites in theVEGFApromoter region, which may play a role in upregulatingVEGFAtranscription through TCF7L2 binding (23). Our results are correlated with those of a previous study that showed that the expression ofVEGFAin human lymphoblastoid cell lines is induced after treatment with an ER stressor (12). ER stress is also an important feature of chronic metabolic disease that is linked to both metabolic and immune regulation (24). It has been reported that lymphoblastoid cells from T2DM subjects with the genotypes of TT/TC have a higher expression ofTCF7L2in basal condition (25). One of the plausible explanations is that the lymphoblastoid cells from T2DM subjects may already suffer from ER stress and that the T risk allele confers additional susceptibility to ER stress. The results indicate that ER stress may play an important role in triggering the increase of the expression ofTCF7L2andVEGFA. The OIR mouse model has been widely used in studies related to PDR (13). In this model, neovascularization and proliferative retinopathy develop reliably (and quantifiably) over 17 days (26). Activation of ER stress and increasedVEGFAcan be observed in OIR mice models (15). We found that the ER stress-positive marker p-eIF2alpha increased in OIR mice retinas. OIR mice retinas had higherTCF7L2andVEGFAmRNA levels than those of controls. These findings suggested that TCF7L2 may be a potential mediator of retinal neovascularization activated by ER stress during retinal neovascularization. Some evidence indicates that other risk factors, such as BMI, are implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy (27,28). Our study demonstrated a relationship between higher BMI and an increased risk of T2DM-PDR. There are some limitations in our study:1) human lymphoblastoid cell lines are a reasonable choice of cells to study the effect of genotype, but they will only be a surrogate model for cells in retina;2) tunicamycin is a strong chemical ER stressor and not entirely relevant in vivo; and3) it will be valuable to analyze more covariables like T2DM onset, HbA1clevels (uncontrolled glycemia), fasting glucose, fatty acid, lipid profile, or blood pressure. In summary, our study shows thatTCF7L2is associated with PDR in Caucasian T2DM subjects. Our results demonstrate thatTCF7L2expression is altered under ER stress and promote pathological retinal neovascularization via upregulation ofVEGFA. Our findings also provide genetic evidence further implicating the Wnt/beta-catenin-signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of PDR and suggest thatTCF7L2may serve as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of PDR.
