Stress fractures were first reported in the metatarsals of Prussian soldiers in 1855,Noneand Stechow found radiographic evidence of metatarsal stress fractures of military recruits in 1897. NoneThe earliest known diagnosis of a stress fracture on the femoral shaft in an athlete occurred in 1934. NoneDevas published the first comprehensive study of incidence in a series of athletes with fibular stress fractures in 1956. NoneGrowing participation in athletic activity coupled with improving medical technology has resulted in a greater awareness of stress fractures. A comprehensive study of 320 cases in athletes describes the distribution of stress fractures based on bone location, associated activity, sex, and age. NoneStress fractures most commonly occur in the metatarsals, tibia, fibula, and tarsal navicular of track and field athletes, runners, and dancers. NoneIn one study, over a 2-year period, 34 of 914 varsity collegiate 1-AA athletes were diagnosed with a stress fracture. NoneThese fractures account for over 10% of all injuries in sports medicine clinics,Noneand in running sports, they may account for up to 31% of all injuries. NoneA stress fracture is a fatigue fracture of bone caused by repeated submaximal stress. None,NoneThe force required to generate a stress fracture is less than the maximum tolerated by bone, but its repetitive application causes a disruption in the bone homogeneity. None,NoneDuring athletic activity, fatigued muscles subject the bone to increasing force, which may contribute to the overloading process. None,NoneOver time, microfractures accumulate and a stress fracture may develop. None"Stress fracture" is often used synonymously with stressreaction. A stress reaction is bone inflammation seen on a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or radionucleotide bone scan; it is possibly a microfracture of bone. NoneA stress fracture is a true fracture with cortical disruption. None,None,None,NoneIn the competitive athlete, a stress fracture can be difficult to treat, with return to activity ranging from weeksNone,Noneto monthsNonedepending on the location. A premature return to full activity may increase the risk of complications. If complete union is not obtained prior to a return to full activity, an athlete risks delayed union or nonunion. NoneTherefore, early recognition and prompt treatment are important to the management of these injuries. NoneTraining habits, combined with biologic and biomechanical factors, contribute to stress fractures. A sudden increase in exercise intensity increases the risk of a stress fracture. NoneWhen training is progressed rapidly, bones may sustain extra force due to muscle fatigue. NoneThis theory is supported by evidence that military recruits are most likely to endure a stress fracture during their first weeks of service. NoneAdditionally, in one study, elite male European soccer players with a shorter preseason were at a higher risk for developing stress fractures. NoneThe protective effect of physical training in preventing lower extremity stress injury has been demonstrated in recruits entering into the naval conditioning program. None,NoneSeveral studies have correlated running mileage and risk of stress fractures. None,NoneIn a randomized study of 350 male army recruits in a standard running regimen or a weighted marching program, a reduction in running distance resulted in fewer injuries and lower injury severity. NoneA surveyed cohort of 1680 runners correlated running mileage as well as year-round running with increased risk for injury, including stress fractures. NoneFrom development to degradation, bone health is influenced by diet,None,Nonehormone levels,None,None,Noneand biomechanics. None,None,None,NoneBone of high mineral density may be less likely to endure a stress fracture because it can better withstand repetitive applications of force,None,Nonealthough studies are contradictory. None,None,None,NoneA prospective cohort of track and field athletes found statistically significant lower values for total body mineral content and lumbar spine and foot bone mineral density in female athletes sustaining stress fractures. NoneA trend was noted for decreased bone density in men sustaining stress fractures, though this was not statistically significant. NoneDiet may influence bone health and risk of stress fractures. None,None,None,NoneA prospective cohort of competitive female distance runners showed that increased calcium, vitamin D, and protein intake correlated with increased bone mineral density and protection from stress fractures, while potassium was associated with increased bone mineral density alone. NoneProtein likely improves calcium absorption or increases insulinlike growth factor 1 with subsequent skeletal benefit. NonePotassium is associated with higher fruit and vegetable intake,Nonereduced bone turnover,Noneand increased alkali load. NoneAn additional cup of skim milk consumed per day may reduce the incidence of stress fractures by 62%. NoneA double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of female navy recruits showed a 20% lower incidence of stress fractures in those consuming 2000 mg of calcium and 800 international units of vitamin D daily. NoneA small study of male recruits found no statistical difference in stress fractures with a supplemental 500 mg of calcium daily. NoneThe female athlete triad of disordered eating, amenorrhea, and osteoporosis significantly increases the risk of stress fracture because of the negative effect on bone health. None,NoneAmenorrhea in athletes is multifactorial, resulting from energy deficit, decreased leptin levels,Nonedecreased gonadotropins,Noneand/or stress from competition. The end result is a hypoestrogenemic state. NoneLower estrogen levels result in increased calcium resorption and decreased bone storage of calcium. NoneA small case-control study of 19 female athletes showed direct correlations between the incidence of stress fractures and both current menstrual abnormalities and decreased bone mineral density. NoneThe relative risk of stress fracture in athletes with menstrual disturbances is 2 to 4 times that of eumenorrheic athletes. NoneLeg length discrepancy may predispose an athlete to a stress fracture. None,None,NoneIn army recruits, 73% with leg length inequalities sustained stress fractures in the longer leg, and a discrepancy greater than 5 mm increased the likelihood of fracture. NoneIn another study, stress fractures occurred more often in the shorter leg, with a mean leg length difference of 1.3 mm between controls and patients. NoneOther studies demonstrate that stress fractures occur in both short and long legs. None,NoneAthletes with tibial stress fractures have more knee joint stiffness during initial loading. NonePeak hip adduction and rearfoot eversion angles during the stance phase of running were increased in runners with previous tibial stress fractures. NoneBiomechanical studies suggest that gait retraining to reduce tibial acceleration and loading may reduce stress fractures. NoneA prospective clinical study of military recruits found that those with pes planus (flatfoot) have an increased risk of metatarsal stress fractures, and those with pes cavus (high arch) are prone to femoral and tibial stress fractures. NoneAdditionally, foot pronation may be a factor in the development of stress fractures, as biomechanical data in runners suggest that rotation helps distribute the impact throughout the tibia and lower extremity. NoneHard surfaces usually pose a higher risk for stress fractures. None,NoneTibial strain and strain rates in runners were 48% to 285% higher when running over ground compared with treadmills. NoneIn a prospective cohort study of 582 habitual runners, females had a greater risk of injury when running on concrete surfaces. NoneWorn running shoes may increase the risk for stress fracture because of decreased shock absorption,Nonesimilar to combat boots. NoneA meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials on insoles suggests a reduction in stress fractures in the military population. NoneStress fractures may be preceded by an increase in activityNoneand present initially with discomfort only during activity. NoneThe pain usually progresses after activity, eventually leading to pain at rest. NoneFemale athletes are 1.5 to 3.5 times more likely to sustain a stress fracture than male athletes,None,Noneand fewer risk factors are known for men. None,NoneLow testosterone levels may increase risk for male athletes. None,NoneAfrican Americans are less prone to stress fractures, possibly due to increased bone mass, size, and geometry. None,NoneClinical assessment begins with lower limb alignment (varus or valgus) and symmetry in the legs, ankles, and feet, as these may effect biomechanical forces. None,NonePes planus or cavus may increase the risk of certain stress fractures. NoneLocal tenderness,Noneswelling, and warmth may be present. NoneChronic cases may present with a palpable callus. NoneIf the suspected fracture is not readily palpable, such as the femoral neck, range of motion should be evaluated for pain. NoneThe fulcrum test (Figure 1) may help diagnose stress fractures. NoneFulcrum test: Examiner applies downward pressure on the knee with the opposite arm under the patient's thigh. A positive test result elicits thigh pain. Sacral stress fractures may produce a positive FABER (Figure 2); and/or Flamingo test(s), pain with hip flexion, abduction, and external rotation, or pain when standing on the affected limb, respectively. None,NoneFABER test: Examiner applies downward pressure on the knee. A positive test result elicits pelvic or groin pain. Standard radiographs are commonly used as the initial assessment of suspected stress fractures and can confirm the diagnosis. NoneHowever, in the early stages, radiographs have a low sensitivity (10%) and are of limited utility. NoneMRI is the most comprehensive method to evaluate a potential stress fractureNone,None,None,None,Nonebecause of a high level of both sensitivity (86%-100%) and specificity (100%). Recovery time may be predictable based on a 4-level grading system originally described in the tibia (Figure 3). None,None,None,None,None,NoneThis system can be applied to other bones (Table 1).

Note: This table was adapted from Arendt et al4 with permission from Clin Sports Med. Computed tomography is useful in detecting stress fractures in the pelvis and sacrum, which are not well visualized by MRI (sensitivity of 42% and specificity of 100%). None,NoneAdditionally, computed tomography can differentiate a stress fracture from a stress reaction and can be used for preoperative planning. NoneRadiation exposure with computed tomography can be significant, but the effective dose of radiation decreases substantially with distance of the imaged extremity from the torso. NoneBone scanning is highly sensitive (74%-84%)None,Nonebut nonspecific (33%)None,Nonefor stress fractures. False positives can occur from increased bone metabolism in tumors or infections. NoneDifferentiating acute stress reactions and stress fractures can be difficult. NoneUltrasonography may be useful because it is noninvasive and simple to perform (operator dependent). None,NoneIn a pilot case-control study of 37 patients with metatarsal pain and normal radiographs, ultrasonography had a sensitivity of 83% and specificity of 76% compared with MRI in detecting metatarsal stress fractures. NoneAlso, sonograms may demonstrate fluid collections, soft tissue edema, periosteal thickening, and increased vasculature. NoneBecause of their tendency for nonunion or delayed union, certain stress fractures can be high-risk, requiring prompt treatment and careful monitoring to prevent complications (Table 2). None,NoneFor displaced fractures or those on the tension side of the femoral neck (Figure 4), one should consider surgery. None,NoneStress fracture risk for delayed union. (a) Radiograph of a 51-year-old avid hiker with hip pain. Tension-side stress fracture can be seen (arrow). (b) Surgical fixation of the fracture. The tibia accounts for 25.9% to 49.1% of all stress fractures, particularly in long-distance runners. None,None,None,None,NoneThese fractures may occur along the diaphysis and are typically transverse, although longitudinal fractures do occur and are at a higher risk for delayed union or nonunion. None,NoneAll running and high-impact activities should cease until the patient is asymptomatic with walking. NoneIn some low-risk fractures, when a period of relative rest does not allow the patient to return to a level of full functionality, immobilization may be required to promote healing before a gradual return to activity. NoneA randomized controlled trial of pneumatic leg bracing versus traditional relative rest in athletes showed that bracing reduced the time to light activity from 21 to 7 days and to unrestricted activity from 77 to 21 days. NoneIn military recruits, however, pneumatic bracing had no significant benefit in time to pain-free hop test or 1-mile run. NoneIn the high-risk anterior tibia, radiography can reveal the "dreaded black line" (Figure 5). NoneThese stress fractures often take longer to heal and can result in nonunion. In one study, pneumatic bracing for 21 weeks avoided surgical intervention in delayed unions of the anterior tibia, with all patients returning to full activity at 12 months, radiographic evidence of healing in 75% of fractures. NoneTibial intramedullary nailing with a reamed intramedullary nail and locking screws (Figure 6) is an effective treatment. None,None,NoneRadiographic union of the fracture can be expected at 3 months postoperatively, with return to competition at 4 months. NoneLateral radiograph of a 21-year-old male football player with intermittent worsening bilateral anterior shin pain. Black lines indicate stress fractures of the anterior tibial cortex.

Image reprinted from Varner et alNonewith permission from SAGE Publications. Medial malleolus stress fractures are rare in young athletes but are seen in the elderly. None,NoneThese fractures are well managed with nonsurgical treatment: modified rest and cessation of running and jumping for 3 to 8 weeks. NoneDelayed union or nonunion following conservative treatment may require operative initiative. NoneOblique drilling of the medial malleolus may promote fracture healing, with a recovery time of 5 months. NoneFibular stress fractures account for 5.1% to 9.3% of all stress fractures. None,None,NoneMost commonly occurring in the distal third,None,Nonethey are frequently seen in runners training on hard surfaces. NoneThey may be caused by muscle traction and torsional forces, as opposed to weightbearing compression. NoneThese fractures are low-risk, and can be managed with cessation of activity until point tenderness resolves. NoneStress fractures of the femur occur most often in the femoral neck and represent 1.0% to 7.2% of all stress fracture injuries. None,None,NoneThey are relatively rare, associated with coxa vara (decrease in femoral neck-shaft angle),Noneand range from low- to high-risk. NoneHigh-risk fractures result from tension on the lateral aspect of the femoral neck. They are inherently unstable and prone to displacement (Figure 7). NoneNondisplaced fractures can be treated with strict adherence to nonweightbearing movements until callus is seen radiographically. None,NoneHowever, percutaneous screw fixation with 6.5- to 7.3-mm cannulated screws is often used in these high-risk fractures. None,NoneCoronal T1 image demonstrating a right tension-sided femoral neck stress fracture in a 27-year-old military recruit. Image reprinted from Provencher et alNonewith permission from SAGE Publications. Medial femoral neck fractures result from compressive forces and are low-risk (Figure 8). NoneIf a fracture line is not visible on radiography, it may be safely treated with a nonweightbearing regimen. NoneSwimming or cycling can be permitted. NoneInsufficiency or fatigue stress fractures in the femoral head are high-risk in otherwise healthy patients. NoneIf not recognized early, delayed union, nonunion, displacement, or avascular necrosis may ensue. NoneSuspicion should arise with exercise-induced pain in the groin, hip, or proximal thigh that is relieved by rest.

Image reprinted from Fredericson et alNonewith permission from Lippincott, Williams, and Wilkins, Inc.Nondisplaced stress fractures of the femoral shaft can sometimes be managed with limited weightbearingNone,None(Figure 9). Surgical intervention should be considered with displaced, delayed union, and nonunited fractures. NoneSagittal STIR image of a femoral shaft stress fracture (arrow) in a 21-year-old college basketball player. Patellar stress fractures (Figure 10) are rare, representing 0.9% of all stress fractures,None,Noneand are high-risk if left untreated. NoneFor transverse patella fractures, immobilization may be successful. NoneOpen reduction and internal fixation with tension band wiring and adjunctive iliotibial band release may be a better option for quicker return to activity, with reported recovery of 6 to 12 weeks. None,NoneNondisplaced longitudinal fractures can be treated conservatively with bracing. NoneLateral radiograph of a 20-year-old basketball player with a transverse stress fracture of the inferior third if the patella. Image reprinted from Keeley et alNonewith permission from BioMed Central. Pelvic stress fractures are rare (1.6% to 7.1% of all stress fractures)None,None,None(Figure 11). They may be difficult to detect. NonePubic rami fractures are more common in women, with pain in the inguinal, perineal, or adductor region. NonePelvic stress fracture (arrow) in a 40-year-old distance runner. An athlete recovering from any stress fracture must comply with a gradual return to activity to allow for bone healing and remodeling. None,NoneAn athlete who rushes return to play risks further injury, possibly more serious than the initial insult. NoneAnimal studies of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory treatment show delayed stress fracture healing, likely due to prostaglandin synthesis disruption. None,NoneHowever, a meta-analysis did not find a significant risk of nonunion with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory exposure. NoneThe use of bisphosphonates is not supported by randomized clinical trials. None,NoneHowever, a case study of 5 collegiate female runners with stress fractures on bone scan showed recovery within 1 week of treatment with intravenous pamidronate. NoneBisphosphonates have not been shown to be effective prophylaxis in young military recruits at risk. NoneConcerns exist regarding bisphosphonate use in women of childbearing age. Animal studies show that these drugs may cross the placenta and disrupt fetal osseous development. None,NoneHowever, a review of 51 casesNoneand a prospective cohort studyNoneof pregnancy or prepregnancy exposure to bisphosphonates did not demonstrate a relationship with congenital abnormalities. A recent review highlighted the emergence of atypical subtrochanteric stress fractures of the femurNonefrom oversuppression of bone turnover, a finding only observed to date in elderly patients. NoneSide effects of bisphosphonates depend on the route of administration, and may include nephrotoxicity and osteonecrosis of the jaw. None,NoneBoth low-intensity pulsed ultrasound and electrical stimulation may increase the rate of bone healing in acute fractures. None,NoneHowever, the efficacy of stimulation for stress fractures is unknown. NoneIn a prospective, randomized, double-blinded study, 26 patients were treated daily with either pulsed ultrasound or placebo until asymptomatic, and ultrasound did not significantly reduce the healing time of tibial stress fractures. NoneLow-intensity ultrasound promoted an early return to athletic competition in an uncontrolled study of 8 patients with tibial stress fractures (7 posteromedial and 1 anterior). NonePatients continued competitive sports during treatment. Electric field stimulation may hasten recovery in acute tibial stress fractures. NoneA randomized control trial of 44 patients with posteromedial stress fractures did not demonstrate an overall benefit from the treatment. NoneHowever, fractures graded more severe based on radiologic criteriaNonehealed quicker when treated with electric field stimulation, suggesting that the device may be helpful in these severe injuries. NoneIn 5 chronic stress fractures, extracorporeal shock wave therapy showed bony union at a mean of 3 months, and return to athletics between 3 and 6 months. NoneA recent retrospective study of male soccer players with fifth metatarsal and tibial fractures treated with 3 sessions of extracorporeal shock wave therapy every 47 hours reported fracture healing in 6 to 14 weeks, and return to competition between 3 and 10 months posttreatment. NoneTo prevent stress fractures, athletes should progress activity levels gradually (no more than a 10% increase in load per week) to strengthen leg muscles, avoiding sudden increases in activity and running mileage. None,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,NoneTraining surface,None,None,Nonefootwear, and the female athlete triad may predispose some to stress fractures. None,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,NoneMRI provides the highest sensitivity and specificity, making it the test of choice for diagnosing these injuries. None,None,NoneHigh-risk stress fractures include the femoral neck, patella, anterior tibial diaphysis, and the medial malleolus.
