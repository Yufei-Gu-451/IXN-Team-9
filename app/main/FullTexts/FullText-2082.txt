Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neuro-degenerative disorder associated with memory impairment and cognitive deficit. It is characterized by low levels of acetylcholine in the brain of AD patients. According to the cholinergic hypothesis, the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), an enzyme that catalyzes acetylcholine hydrolysis, increases the levels of acetylcholine in the brain, thus improving cholinergic functions in AD patients. Further-more, although the general consensus concludes that AChE inhibitors (AChEi) can alleviate AD symptoms, they neither delay nor reverse the disease progress. Most of the drugs currently available for the treatment of AD are AChEi: tacrine (1), donezepil (2), rivastigmine (3) and galanthamine (4), all of which have limited effectiveness and some kind of side effect [1]. Tacrine (1) and donepezil (2), both from synthetic origin, were the first drugs approved for the treatment of cognitive loss in AD patients by US-FDA in 1993 and 1996, respectively. Rivastigmine (3) was approved in 2000 (US-FDA) and was designed from the lead compound physostigmine, a natural AChEi alkaloid. Galanthamine (4), a natural alkaloid first obtained fromGalanthusspp. was approved by US-FDA in 2001. Huperzine A (5), an alkaloid found inHuperziaspp., is an AChEi commercialized as a dietary supplement for memory support and it is used to treat AD symptoms in China. This alkaloid has been thoroughly studied with promising results yielded particularly from the evaluation of cognitive performance of animals as well as from studies on its efficacy, tolerance and safety. Taking into account that inhibitors3,4and5are related to natural products and that AChEi are an important therapeutic strategy for the treatment of AD, many research groups have focused their studies on naturally-occurring compounds from plants as potential sources of either new or more effective AChEi. These studies led to the discovery of an important number of secondary metabolites as well as plant extracts, both of which are characterized by their ability to inhibit AChE. On the other hand, the fact that a significantly relevant number of research papers has been recorded in this field during the last decades can be clearly attributed to the development of colorimetric methods which allow a rapid and facile screening of a large number of samples. Ellman's method is the most widely used for the detection of AChEi, even in complex mixtures, and for the quantification of anti-AChE inhibitory activity [2-6]. Several reviews on the newly discovered AChEi obtained from plants, fungus and marine organisms have also been published over the last years [7-10]. The majority of these AChEi belong to the alkaloid group, including indole, isoquinoline, quinolizidine, piperidine and steroidal alkaloids. On the other hand, several non-alkaloidal and potent AChEi have been obtained from natural sources, including terpenoids, flavonoids and other phenolic compounds. Interestingly, although literature demonstrates to be rich in the study on AChEi obtained from plants, this issue keeps on being the center of attention for research as confirmed by the increasing number of studies published every year. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive summary of the literature, particularly that published during 2006-2012 (1stsemester) on plant-derived compounds, plant extracts and essential oils which have been reported to inhibit AChE. Readers interested not only in previous findings but also in synthetic/semisynthetic AChEi or natural AChEi of fungal, marine or microbial origin are recommended to see the above-mentioned reviews i.e. [7-10]. For the sake of brevity and in order to focus our attention on the most relevant findings, only those research papers reporting quantified results (IC50 and/or percentage of inhibition at a given concentration) were included. Extracts or essential oils with IC50 greater than 0.5 mg/ml were considered weakly active and were therefore not taken into account in the present review. With a few exceptions, only molecules with IC50 less than 50 uM have been considered. Furthermore, unless otherwise stated, those results on AChE inhibition included in the present review refer toin vitroassays carried out with AChE from electric eel. The quinoline alkaloids 3-hydroxy-2,2,6-trimethyl-3,4,5,6-tetrahydro-2H-pyrano[3,2-c] quinoline-5-one (6), ribalinine (7) and methyl isoplatydesmine (8) isolated from the aerial parts ofSkimmia laureola(Rutaceae) were found to be linear mixed inhibitors of AChE withKNone= 110.0, 30.0 and 30.0 uM, respectively [11]. These alkaloids were also observed to evidence butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibition. On the other hand, of the several alkaloids that were isolated from the active extracts ofEsenbeckia leiocarpa(Rutaceae), leptomerine (9) and kokusaginine (10) with IC50values of 2.5 and 46 uM, respectively, were observed to elicit AChE inhibitory activity [12]. The isolation of skimmianine (11), a furoquinoline alkaloid with very low AChE inhibitory activity, was also reported by the same authors. This alkaloid was observed in another Rutaceae,Zanthoxylum nitidum, exhibiting a moderate AChE inhibitory activity (IC50= 8.6 ug/ml) [13]. Nelumbo nuciferais a well-known medicinal plant belonging to the Nelumbonaceae family which was studied due to its therapeutic potential [14]. N-methylasimilobine (12), an aporphine alkaloid with an IC50= 1.5 ug/ml which was found to be a non-competitive inhibitor, was recently isolated from this plant [15]. In a random screening, two extracts ofBeilschmiediaspecies were observed to exhibit AChE inhibition and a phytochemical study ofB. alloiophyllaandB. kunstlerirevealed the presence of several alkaloids with IC50values ranging between 2.0 and 10.0 uM [16]. The most potent AChEi were found to be 2-hydroxy-9-methoxyaporphine (13), laurotetanine (14), liriodenine (15) and oreobeiline (16) (IC50= 2.0-5.0 uM), with anti-AChE activity comparable to huperzine A (IC50= 1.8 uM). A significant AChE inhibitory activity was also observed in secoboldine (17), boldine (18), isoboldine (19), asimilobine (20) and 3-methoxynordomesticine (21) (IC50= 8.4 - 10.0 uM). Research on plants from the genusCorydalis(Papaveraceae) which are used for the treatment of memory dysfunction in folk medicine reported the presence of benzylisoquinoline alkaloids with anti-AChE activity [7]. The ethanolic extract obtained from the tuber ofC. turtschaninoviipreviously found to elicit AChE inhibition was selected to carry out a chemical study which led to the isolation of the isoquinoline alkaloids stylopine (22), epiberberine (23), pseudodehydrocorydaline (24), pseudocopsitine (25) and pseudoberberine (26). In the assay with mouse brain cortex as a source of AChE enzyme, the IC50values obtained for each of these alkaloids were 15.8, 6.5, 8.4, 4.3 and 4.5 uM, respectively [17]. In addition, alkaloids25 and26, the two most active compounds, were found to elicit anti-amnesic activity [17, 18]. Alkaloids with benzylisoquinoline skeleton fromCorydalisspecies having aromatic methylenedioxy groups and a quaternary atom of nitrogen were observed to show the strongest AChE inhibition [7, 17, 18]. In a more recent work, six protoberberine alkaloids23,27-31, were identified in rhizomes ofCoptis chinensiswhich are traditionally used in Chinese medicine for the treatment of various diseases. Coptidis rhizomes and their alkaloids were reported to have cognitive-enhancing and neuroprotective effects and the analysis of the anti-AChE activity of these alkaloids showed that the IC50values of berberine (27), palmatine (28), jateorrhizine (29), coptisine (30) and groenlandicine (31) ranged between 0.44 and 0.80 uM while that of epiberberine (23) was slightly higher (IC50= 1.07 uM) [19]. Of these alkaloids, compounds27,30and31were observed to have an aromatic methylenedioxy group. In this study groenlandicine (31) and berberine (27) were found to be the most active as BChE inhibitors and epiberberine (23) was observed to significantly inhibit beta-secretase (BACE1) [19]. The alkaloids (+)-canadaline (32) and (+)-canadine (33), both isolated fromCorydalis cava and with an IC50 = 20.1 and 12.4 uM, respectively,were observed to elicit a moderate inhibitory activity when tested with AChE from human blood [20]. On the other hand,Stephania venosa(Menispermaceae), a Thai medicinal plant, was found to show a high AChE inhibitory activity. The ethanolic extract ofS. venosa was subjected to bioassay-guided fractionation to identify AChEi [21]. The following moderately active quaternary protoberberine alkaloids could be isolated: stepharanine (34), cyclanoline (35) andN-methyl stepholidine (36) with IC50values of 14.10, 9.23 and 31.30 uM, respectively. A similar fractionation approach was followed to identify the compounds responsible for AChE inhibition inChelidonium majus (Papaveraceae) [22]. Three active constituents were identified, namely 8-hydroxydihydrochelerythrine (37), 8-hydroxydihydrosanguinarine (38) and berberine (27). Compounds37and38, with no previous record as AChEi, were found to elicit significant anti-AChE activity with an IC50= 0.61 and 1.37 uM, respectively. Taspine (39) was isolated from the alkaloid-enriched extract obtained fromMagnolia x soulangiana(Magnoliaceae) [None]. This alkaloid was found not only to show a dose-dependent and long-lasting inhibitory effect on AChE (IC50= 0.33 uM) but also to be more potent than galanthamine (IC50= 3.2 uM) although its inhibitory activity is comparable to that of tacrine (IC50= 0.22 uM). Similar observations were obtained when thein vitroassay was performed with human AChE (IC50= 0.54 uM). Compound39resulted to be inactive against BChE, acting as a selective AChEi. Catharanthus roseus(Apocynaceae) is a plant mainly known as a source of vincristine and vinblastine, two alkaloids found in its leaves and appreciated as anticancer compounds. Several other compounds with biological importance can be also found inC. roseus. For example, the alkaloid serpentine (40), isolated from the roots of this plant, was reported to be a potentin vitroAChEi (IC50 = 0.775 uM) compared with physostigmine (IC50 = 6.45 uM) [24]. A bioassay-guided fractionation from the stems ofErvatamia hainanensis(Apocynaceae), a plant used in traditional Chinese medicine, allowed the isolation of several monoterpenoid indole alkaloids, some of them showing a potent AChE inhibitory activity [25]. For example, coronaridine (41) and voacangine (42), differing from each other only by the methoxy group attached to the aromatic ring, were observed to have an IC50= 8.6 and 4.4 uM, respectively, these values being similar to that of galanthamine (3.2 uM). On the other hand, 10-hydro-xycoronaridine (43) was found to evidence a reduced AChE inhibition (IC50= 29 uM), which was attributed to the introduction of a hydroxyl group to the aromatic ring. The indole alkaloids coronaridine (41) and voacangine (42), both detected in the stalks ofTabernaemontana australis (Apocynaceae), had been formerly identified as AChEi but no inhibition values were reported [26]. The genusTabernaemontana is known for the wide variety of unusual bioactive indole alkaloids it produces. Among them, the bisindole alkaloids isolated fromT. divaricataroots are an interesting example of new structures with potent AChE inhibitory activity. The crude alkaloid extract obtained from the root ofT. divaricatawas found to yield four bisindole alkaloids44-47[27]. The analysis of AChE inhibition revealed that 19,20-dihydrotabernamine (44) and 19,20-dihydroervahanine A (45) strongly inhibit AChE, with an IC50= 0.227 and 0.071 uM, respectively, thus showing that they are significantly more active than galanthamine (IC50= 0.594 uM). The fact that inhibition was found to be higher for compound45than for compound44suggests that the introduction of a carbomethoxy group at C16' increases the enzymatic inhibition. In addition, taking into account that conodurine (46) and tabernaelegantine (47) were found to show no activity in AChE, it was suggested that the substitution at C11' and C12' is relevant for AChE inhibitory activity [27]. Uncaria rhynchophylla(Rubiaceae) is a Chinese medicine herb used to treat epilepsy. The alkaloid fraction fromU. rhynchophylla is known for its antiepileptic and neuroprotective effects. Geissoschizine methyl ether (48), a strong AChEi, as well as six other weakly active alkaloids were recently isolated from this herb [28]. The active compound48was observed to inhibit AChE in a reversible and non-competitive way with an IC50= 3.7 ug/ml. The study of AChE inhibitory activity of Brazilian apocynaceaHimatanthus lancifolius, commonly known as "agoniada", led to the identification of active extracts in this plant and allowed the isolation of uleine (49), an active indole alkaloid, at a high concentration in the alkaloid fraction. The IC50value observed for this alkaloid was 0.45 uM [29]. As to the Amaryllidaceae family, phytochemical research conducted in the last decades on this family revealed several alkaloids with moderate or potent inhibition of AChE [3, 7, 30]. In the search of new natural sources of galanthamine and other Amaryllidaceae alkaloids with anti-AChE activity, bulbs and leaves ofHippeastrum papiliocollected in the South of Brazil were studied. Galanthamine (4), the already known alkaloids narwedine (50), haemanthamine (51), 11-hydroxyvittatine (52), 8-O-demethylmaritidine (53) and vittatine (54) as well as the new alkaloid 11(-hydro-xygalanthamine (55) were all isolated and of all of them galanthamine was obtained in significant amounts [31]. Compound55was observed to elicit AChE inhibition as other galanthamine-type alkaloids do, with an IC50 = 14.5 uM. Furthermore, because habranthine, epimer of55, was observed to have an anti-AChE activity similar to that of galanthamine, it was concluded that beta configuration at C11 is unfavorable for the interaction with AChE [3, 31]. Other potent AChEi, such asN-allylnorgalanthamine (56) andN-(14-methylallyl)norgalanthamine (57), were isolated fromLeucojum aestivum, an amaryllidacea used for the industrial extraction of galanthamine [32]. N-alkylated galanthamine derivatives56and57 were isolated together with galanthamine (4), epinorgalanthamine (58), narwedine (50) and lycorine (59), from the mother liquors obtained after the industrial production of galanthamine. Alkaloids56and57, with IC50 values of 0.18 and 0.16 uM, respectively, resulted to be ten times more potent AChEi than galanthamine (IC50 = 1.82 uM). The chemical investigation ofGalanthus rizehensis, a wild-growing species from Turkey, allowed the isolation of two new Amaryllidaceae alkaloidN-oxides, incartineN-oxide (60) and lycorineN-oxide (61) and seven known alkaloids namely, 1-acetyl-beta-carboline (62), incartine (63),N-trans feruloyltyramine (64), lycorine (59),O-methylnorbelladine (65), vittatine (54) and 11-hydroxyvittatine (52) [33]. The potential of these alkaloids as AChEi was analyzed but only incartineN-oxide (60) was observed to elicit a moderate inhibitory activity (IC50= 34.50 uM), incartine (63) was observed to be weakly active (IC50= 106.97 uM) and the other alkaloids were found to be inactive. In a bioassay-guided fractionation of an active extract obtained from bulbs ofNerine bowdenii, the Amaryllidaceae alkaloid undulatine (66) was identified as the most active component of the alkaloid fraction, with an IC50= 37 uM [34]. Although benzylphenethylamine alkaloids were considered to belong exclusively to the Amaryllidaceae, some of them have been found to belong to other families [35]. A new example of this exception was found through the chemical investigation ofHosta plantaginea(Liliaceae) [36]. Seventeen benzylphenetylamine alkaloids, including five new alkaloids,67-71, along with twelve known compounds [7-deoxy-trans-dihydronarciclasine,O-methyllycorenine, albomaculine, haemanthamine,O-demethylhaemanthamine, 8-O-demethylmaritadine, haemanthidine, yemenine C, lycorine, pseudolycorine, ungeremine (72) and norsanguinine (73)] were obtained. Some of these alkaloids were analyzed to determine whether they are AChEi or not.. Ungeremine (72) (IC50 = 3.85 uM), norsanguinine (73) (IC50 = 1.43 uM) and 8-demethoxy-10-O-methylhostasine (69) (IC50= 2.32 uM) were all found to be potent AChE inhibitors. After the isolation of the potent AChEi huperzine A (5) fromHuperzia serrata(Lycopodiaceae), several plants belonging to the genusLycopodiumhave been investigated in an attempt to find alkaloids with unusual skeletons that could have AChE inhibitory activity [7, 8, 37]. NoneFive new Lycopodium alkaloids, 11(-hydroxyfawcettidine (74), 2(,11(-dihydroxyfawcettidine (75), 8(,11(-dihydro-xyfawcettidine (76), 2beta-hydroxylycothunine (77) and 8(-hydroxylycothunine (78), with the fawcettimine skeleton were isolated fromL. serratum, along with three known alkaloids, lycothunine (79), serratine (80) and serratanidine (81) [38]. AChE inhibitory activity was analyzed for the alkaloid lycoposerramine-H (82) previously isolated fromL. serratum [39] and for compounds74,75,78. Alkaloids75 and82were observed to inhibit AChE with an IC50= 27.9 and 16.7 uM, respectively, while74and78were observed to show no anti-AChE activity. In another study, three new alkaloids (83 -85) were isolated fromL. carinatum, a species collected in Malasya [40]. Carinatumins A (83) and B (84) were observed to inhibit AChE from bovine erythrocytes with an IC50= 4.6 and 7.0 uM, respectively, whereas carinatumin C (85) was observed to show no inhibition (IC50 greater than 100 uM). Alkaloids83and84 were observed to exhibit an AChE inhibitory activity similar to that of huperzine A and huperzine B (IC50= 0.8 and 8.0 uM). Alkaloids fromL. casuarinoideswere also isolated and three new compounds, lycoparins A-C (86 -88), were characterized, of which lycoparin C (88) was found to show a moderate AChE inhibitory activity (from bovine erythrocytes) with an IC50= 25 uM [41]. Lycoparin A (86) and lycoparin B (87), both having a carboxylic acid at C-15 and one or twoN-methyl groups, were found to show no inhibitory activity. As toSarcococcaandBuxusspecies (Buxaceae), they are known to produce steroidal alkaloids, some of which were observed to evidence strong AChE inhibition [7, 42, 43]. New steroidal alkaloid AChEi fromS. salignaandS. hookerianawere recently found. In the case ofS. saligna, the study -which was a continuation of previous research [44, 45]- of the bioactive steroidal alkaloids of this species allowed the isolation of five new compounds (89-93) and two already known bases (94 and95) [46]. The new alkaloids 5,14-dehydro-Na-demethylsaracodine (89), 14-dehydro-Na-demethylsaracodine (90), 16-dehydrosarcorine (91), 2,3-dehydrosarsalignone (92) and 14,15-dehydro-sarcovagine D (93), as well as the known compounds sarcovagine C (94) and salignarine C (95) were analyzed as anti-AChE agents. Only91,92and95were observed to exhibit significant AChE inhibition (IC50 = 12.5, 7.0 and 19.7 uM, respectively). Compounds89 -92,94and95were also found to elicit strong and selective BChE inhibition [46]. The bioassay-guided chemical investigation ofS. hookerianaallowed the isolation of two new pregnane-type steroidal alkaloids, hookerianamide H (96) and hookerianamide I (97) together with the known alkaloidsNa-methylepipachysamine D (98), sarcovagine C (94) and dictyophlebine (99) [47]. Compounds94, 96, 97, 98 and99 were tested for their inhibitory properties towards AChE and all of them were observed to elicit significant inhibitory activity (IC502.9 - 34.1 uM) as well as a potent anti-BChE activity (IC500.3 - 3.6 uM). Further studies onS. hookerianayielded two new 5alpha-pregnane-type steroidal alkaloids, hookerianamides J (100) and K (101) [48]. Furthermore, eight known steroidal alkaloids, hookerianamide H (96) and hookerianamide I (97), chonemorphine (102),N-methylpachysamine A (103), epipachysamine-E-5-en-4-one (104), vagenine A (105), 2,3-dehydrosarsalignone (92) and sarcovagine C (94), were isolated and characterized. Alkaloids94,100, 101, 102, 103 and104 were analyzed as AChEi. Compounds100,101,102and103were observed to inhibit AChE moderately (IC5022.1 - 48.5 uM) while104and94were found to be more active inhibitors (IC509.9 and 8.1 uM, respectively). Phytochemical research onBuxus hyrcanaallowed the identification of several Buxus alkaloids with cholinesterase inhibitory activity [43, 49]. Three new triterpenoidal alkaloids, namely 17-oxo-3-benzoylbuxadine (106), buxhyrcamine (107) and 31-demethylcyclobuxoviridine (108) along with sixteen known compounds, all tested as AChEi, were isolated and characterized in a recent study onB. hyrcana collected from Iran [50]. Weak AChE inhibitory activity was observed forNb-dimethylcyclobuxoviricine (109), papillozine C (110), cyclobuxophylline O (111) and arbora-1,9(11)-dien-3-one (112) (IC50= 35.4 - 47.9 uM). In the samein vitroassay, 17-oxo-3-benzoylbuxadine (106), buxhyrcamine (107), homomoenjodaramine (113), buxmicrophylline F (114), buxrugulosamine (115), moenjodaramine (116) and N20-formyl-buxaminol E (117) were observed to show moderate AChE inhibition (IC50= 17.6 - 25.5 uM) while spirofornabuxine (118) was found to elicit a strong AChE inhibitory activity (IC50= 6.3 uM). The crude methanolic extract ofB. natalensis, a plant used to improve memory in the elderly by traditional healers in South Africa, was found to elicit AChE inhibition (IC50 = 28 ug/mL). NoneThe phytochemical study of this extract yielded seven compounds119 -125 which were found to show either moderate or strong AChE inhibition [51]. The alkaloidsO2-natafuranamine (119),O10-natafuranamine (120), cyclonataminol (121) and 31-demethylbuxaminol (122) were isolated and characterized for the first time while buxaminol A (123) was isolated for the first time as a natural product. Buxafuranamide (124) and buxalongifolamidine (125) were already known compounds. Compounds119,120 and124 were observed to exhibit a significantly higher AChE inhibitory activity compared to the rest, with IC50values of 3.0, 8.5, and 14.0 uM, respectively. Compounds121, 122,123 and125 were observed to be less effective as AChEi (IC50 = 22.9 - 30.2 uM). The bulbs ofFritillaria species (Lilliaceae) which are known to be a traditional medicinal herb called "Beimu" in China are used as an antitussive, antiasthmatic and expectorant agent. In the past, in a chemical study carried out on alkaloids fromF. imperialisbulbs new steroidal alkaloids with weak AChE inhibition and great selectivity towards BChE were identified [52]. Thus, taking into account this previous study, the bulbs from fiveFritillariaspecies were studied and their alkaloids were identified and evaluated as cholinesterase inhibitors. Eighteen alkaloids were isolated and their effects on human whole blood cholinesterase were assayed. Results showed thatN-demethyl-puqietinone (126) fromF. puqiensis, hupeheninoside (127) fromF. hupehensis, ebeiedinone (128) fromF. ebeiensis var. purpurea, yibeinoside A (129) fromF. pallidiflora and chuanbeinone (130) fromF. delavayishowed good AChE inhibition, with IC50values of 6.4, 16.9, 5.7, 6.5 and 7.7 uM, respectively. However, all of them were weaker AChEi than galanthamine (IC50 = 1.9 uM). Compounds127,128,129 and130 were found to be stronger inhibitors on plasma BChE than galanthamine, the positive control [53]. In addition, the following steroidal alkaloids: conessine (131), isoconessimine (132), conessimin (133), conarrhimin (134) and conimin (135) were isolated in a bioassay-guided fractionation from the seeds ofHolarrhena antidysenterica(Apocynaceae), a common Tibetan drug [54]. Compounds131,133,134 and135 were identified as active constituents against AChE. Conessimin (133) was found to be the strongest AChE inhibitor with an IC50 = 4 uM whereas conessine (131), conarrhimin (134) and conimin (135) were found to be moderate AChE inhibitors (IC50 = 21 - 28 uM). These findings indicate that the elimination of the N-methyl group of pyrrolidine moiety induces a significant increase of activity while the cleavage of either one or two N-methyl groups at C-3 position reduces the inhibitory potency. Compound133 was selected for a kinetic study through which it was demonstrated that its AChE inhibitory activity is both reversible and non-competitive. Molecular docking simulations of these compounds with AChE helped to understand their interactions with AChE and were consistent with the experimental results obtained [54]. In spite of the fact that the majority of the most potent inhibitors known to date are alkaloids, several non-alkaloidal AChEi from the plant kingdom and with different structural characteristics (terpenoids, sterols, flavonoids and phenolic compounds, etc) have been recognized as promising lead compounds as anti-AD agents [7-10]. Until 2006 only a few diterpenoids demonstrated to inhibit AChE [7]. However, further recent research has reported a larger number of compounds belonging to this group with the ability to exert either moderate or strong AChE inhibitory activity. In addition, a new cassane diterpene named niloticane (136) was isolated from the ethyl acetate bark extract ofAcacia niloticasubsp. kraussiana (Fabaceae), a plant used in African traditional medicine [55]. Niloticane (136) was found to show an AChE inhibitory activity similar to that of the positive control galanthamine (IC50= 4 and 2 uM, respectively). In addition, one new (137) and six known (138 -143) labdane-type diterpenoids were identified as AChE inhibitors present in an active extract obtained fromLeonurus heterophyllus(Lamiaceae) by bioassay-guided fractionation [56]. Anti-AChE activity in137 -143 was analyzed in rat brain cortex as a source of AChE enzyme. Leoheteronin A (141) and leopersin G (143), both having a 15,16 epoxy group, were observed to be strong inhibitors with IC50values of 11.6 and 12.9 uM, respectively. The new compounds leoheteronin F (137) and leoheteronin D (142) were found to show moderate inhibition with IC50values of 16.1 and 18.4 uM, respectively. Leoheterin (138), hispanone (139) and galeopsin (140), all having a furan ring at the side chain, were found to be weakly active (IC50= 38.5 - 42.7 uM). Asparagus adscendens(Asparagaceae) is a medicinal plant traditionally used as a nerve tonic and remedy for memory impairments in Pakistan. Conypododiol (144), which was isolated from the chloroform fraction of the methanolic extract ofA. adscendens, was found to elicit AChE and BChE inhibition with an IC50= 2.17 and 11.21 uM, respectively [57]. This dual cholinesterase inhibitor was also observed to show potential as a bivalent ligand in molecular docking studies. Four non-competitive AChEi145 -148 were obtained in the chemical investigation ofAjuga bracteosa(Lamiaceae), another medicinal plant from Pakistan [58]. The diterpenoid dihydroajugapitin (148) was found to be the most active against AChE with an IC50= 14.0 uM. Compared to compound148, lupulin A (147), clerodinin A (146) and dihydroclerodin (145) were observed to be less efficient inhibitors (IC50= 19.2, 26.5 and 35.2, respectively) and diterpenoids145 -148were observed to elicit BChE inhibition. These findings indicate that the presence of a methoxy group at C-15 increases cholinesterase inhibitory potential. From the methanolic extract ofHaloxylon recurvum(Chenopodiaceae), a plant used in Pakistan for the treatment of several neuronal disorders, four new C-24 alkylated sterols149 -152 and five known sterols153 -157 were isolated [59]. Compounds149 -157 were analyzed as AChEi and were found to inhibit AChE in a concentration-dependent manner acting as non-competitive inhibitors. Haloxysterol B (150) and haloxysterol C (151), whose IC50values were 0.89 and 1.0 uM, respectively, were found to be the most active AChE inhibitors. Their inhibitory activity was observed to be similar to that of galanthamine (IC500.5 uM). Haloxysterol A (149) and 24-ethyl-cholest-6-ene-3,5-diol (157) were also observed to show potent AChE inhibition with IC50values of 8.3 and 3.5 uM, respectively. Haloxysterol D (152), 5(,8(-epidioxy-(24S)-ethyl-cholest-6,9(11),22(E)-triene-3beta-ol (153), (24S)-ethyl-cholest-7,9(11),22(E)-triene-3beta-ol (154), lawsaritol (155) and 24-ethyl-cholest-7-ene-3,5,6-triol (156) were found to elicit a moderate anti-AChE activity (IC50= 13.7 - 26.4 uM). On the other hand, a bioassay-guided fractionation on the bark ofMesua elegans(Clusiaceae) allowed the isolation of the anti-AChE components responsible for the activity observed for the extract. Mesuagenin B (158) was the most potent inhibitor (IC50= 0.7 uM) and mesuagenin A (159), mesuagenin D (160) and 5,7-dihydroxy-8-(3-methylbutanoyl)-6- (E)-3,7-dimethylocta-2,6-dienyl-4-phenyl-2H-chromen-2-one (161) were observed to elicit strong AChE inhibition with IC50values of 1.06, 8.73 and 3.06 uM, respectively [60]. This bioassay-guided study is the first report of 4-phenylcoumarins as AChEi. In the past, some examples of xanthones with moderate AChE inhibitory activity were reported [7]. Further recent research introduced two new xanthones,162 and163, to this group of AChEi also with moderate inhibitory activity. Macluraxanthone (162) which was obtained from the root ofMaclura pomifera(Moraceae) was found to elicit non-competitive AChE inhibition (IC50= 8.47 uM) [61]. Furthermore, docking studies yielded results supportingin vitroresults. Triptexanthoside C (163) which was isolated from the methanolic extract ofGentianella amarellassp. acuta(Gentianaceae) was observed to elicit AChE inhibition with an IC50= 13.8 uM [62]. The methanolic extract of Paulownia tormentosa fruits, with a potent inhibitory activity against AChE, was subjected to bioactivity-guided fractionation which allowed the identification of some geranylated flavonoids, such as cholinesterase inhibitors, of which the most active resulted to be 6-geranyl-3,3',5,5',7-pentahydroxy-4'-methoxyflavane (164), 6-geranyl-3',5,5',7-tetrahydroxy-4'-methoxyflavanone (165) and diplacone (166), which were observed to show mixed-type inhibition of human AChE with IC50= 15.6, 22.9 and 7.2 uM, respectively [63]. In addition, the fact that these compounds were also observed to elicit significant BChE inhibition makes them interesting as potential dual inhibitors. The flavonols present inSophora flavescens(Fabaceae) were studied for several biological activities relevant for AD. Sophoflavescenol (167), icaritin (168), demethylanhydro-icaritin (169), 8-C-lavandurylkaempferol (170) and kaempferol (171) were all found to be good AChE inhibitors, with IC50values of 8.37, 6.47, 6.67, 5.16 and 3.31 uM, respectively [64]. Compounds167-171 were also found to elicit significant BChE and BACE1 inhibition. The methanol extract from roots ofMorus lhou(Moraceae), a polyphenol-rich plant, was found to yield nine flavonoids (172 -180) of which eight showed AChE inhibition [65]. A new flavone, 5'-geranyl-4'-methoxy-5,7,2'-trihydroxyflavone (172), was identified as the most potent inhibitor (IC50= 10.95 uM). 5'-geranyl-5,7,2',4'-tetrahydroxyflavone (173), kuwanon U (174), kuwanon E (175), morusin (176), cyclomorusin (178), neocyclomorusin (179) and kuwanon C (180) were all observed to be moderate AChE inhibitors (IC50= 16.21 - 36.4 uM) and morusinol (177) was observed to be weakly active (IC50= 173.49 uM). C-3 prenylated flavones176, 178, 179 and180 were found to be noncompetitive inhibitors whereas those unsubstituted at C-3172-175 were mixed inhibitors. Flavonoids172 -180were also found to inhibit BChE [65]. On the other hand, three potent AChEi were obtained fromBroussonetia papyrifera, another plant belonging to the Moraceae family. From the ethanolic extract of the roots ofB. papyriferawhich was found to elicit cholinesterase inhibitory activity, prenylated flavonols181 -183 were isolated and characterized [66]. 8-(1,1-dimethylallyl)-5'-(3-methylbut-2-enyl)-3',4',5,7-tetrahydroxyflavonol (181), papyriflavonol (182) and broussoflavonol (183) were observed to inhibit human erythrocyte AChE with IC50values of 0.82, 3.1 and 2.7 uM, respectively. Compound181, the most potent, acted as a time-dependent, slow reversible inhibitor. Isoorientin (184) and isovitexin (185) were identified as the compounds responsible for the AChE inhibition observed in the extracts from flowers and rhizomes ofIris pseudopumila (Iridaceae) from Italy [67]. Compound184 was observed to be the highest inhibitor with an IC50= 26.8 uM while185, lacking the 3'-hydroxy group in ring B, was observed to show an IC50value of 36.4 uM. Both compounds were also found to have the ability of significantly inhibiting BChE. On the other hand, a pterocarpan with moderate AChE inhibition was isolated from the polar extract ofZygophyllum eurypterum(Zygophyllaceae) collected in Pakistan. Atricarpan D [(-)-2,9-dimethoxy-4-(5-oxohexyl)pterocarpan] (186) was observed to inhibit AChE with an IC50= 20.5 uM [68]. Interestingly, three other pterocarpans with similar structure were obtained along with atricarpan D but they were found to be inactive against AChE. Nevertheless, the four pterocarpans were all found to be BChE inhibitors. A study conducted on AChE and BChE inhibitory activity of coumarins and naphtoquinones obtained fromMansonia gagei(Sterculiaceae) proposed a novel class of cholinesterase inhibitor, mansonones or 1,2-naphtoquinones [69]. The level of cholinesterase inhibition observed in this study seemed to correlate to the presence of a fused pyran ring and a substituent at C-6 being present in the molecule. Mansonone E (187) was observed to be the most active AChE (IC50= 23.5 uM) and BChE inhibitor. In several studies published during the period covered in the present review various phenolic compounds with different structural characteristics were reported as AChEi. Some of them are structurally simple such as gallic acid (188, IC50 = 5.85 uM) and ellagic acid (189, IC50 = 45.63 uM) [70]. Hopeahainol A (190), which was identified as a new compound isolated fromHopea hainensis, was observed to elicit a notable AChE inhibition (IC50 = 4.33 uM) with respect to huperzine A (IC50 = 1.6 uM), as a reversible mixed-type inhibitor [71]. The bioassay-guided fractionation of the extract fromTerminalia chebula(Combretaceae) fruits allowed the isolation of 1,2,3,4,6-penta-O-galloyl-beta-D-glucose (191) which demonstrated to be a significant AChE inhibitor (IC50= 29.9 uM) [72]. This gallotanin which has been also isolated from other different sources and which is known by its diverse biological activities, was observed to exert good BChE inhibition and potent antioxidant activity (FRAP assay) in this study. The bioassay-guided extraction of the stem bark ofKnema laurina(Myristicaceae) yielded two active fractions (dichloromethane and hexane) which were subjected to chromatographic separation. That latter yielded five alkenyl phenol and salicylic acid derivatives192 -196, of which192 and193 were new compounds [73]. Compounds192,195 and196, all having salicylic acid moiety, were observed to strongly inhibit AChE with an IC50= 3.182, 2.172 and 0.573 uM, respectively. Compounds193 and194,with no carboxyl moiety, were observed to be good AChE inhibitors (IC50= 17.224 and 13.114 uM, respectively). These findings suggest that the acidic group is key to good AChE inhibition. It was also observed that anti-AChE activity dramatically decreased when the acidic and the phenolic hydroxy group were methylated. Two catechol alkenyls were isolated from the fruits ofSemecarpus anacardium(Anacardiaceae), a species used in Ayurvedic medicine for retarding and treatment of memory loss [74]. Compounds197 and198 were identified as active components of the dichloromethane extract through a fractionation guided by the detection of AChE inhibition. Microplate assay revealed that these catechol alkenyls are moderate and weak selective AChEi. Compound197, with a double bond in the aliphatic chain, was identified as a stronger inhibitor (IC50= 39.7 uM) with respect to compound198, with two double bonds in the aliphatic chain (IC50= 108 uM). On the other hand, four structurally diverse AChEi were isolated from the polar extract ofNelumbo nucifera(Nelumbonaceae) stamens [75]. Cycloartenol (199),p-hydroxybenzoic acid (200), vanilloloside (201) and nuciferoside (202) were found to elicit good and noncompetitive inhibition against AChE with an IC50= 11.89, 20.07, 4.55 and 3.2 uM, respectively. In the same study, compounds199,200 and202 were observed to exert moderate BChE inhibition and compounds199 -202were found to show no inhibition against BACE1. TableNonesummarizes the studies published from 2006 to 2012 on plant extracts, fractions and essential oils that have been found to be good AChE inhibitors (IC50 less than 500 ug/mL). Those plants included in other recent reviews were omitted [76, 77]. Extracts and fractions under further phytochemical studies that led to the discovery of AChE inhibitors were also omitted. Whenever possible, reference is made to the part of the plant used in each study reported. AChE inhibitory activity is reported in the same way as it was reported by authors and IC50values were chosen instead of inhibition percentages when both were available.
