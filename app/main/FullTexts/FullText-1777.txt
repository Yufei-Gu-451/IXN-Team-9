In the last few years, genome-wide association studies have substantially increased the knowledge of genetic variants predisposing to type 2 diabetes. Although the majority of these single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) seem to influence insulin secretion, few, if any, studies have assessed their simultaneous effects on beta- and alpha-cell function in vivo and in vitro. The aim of the current study was to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the effects of genetic loci associated with type 2 diabetes (1) and/or glucose and insulin levels (2) on islet function in vivo, in a large well-characterized population-based study from the western coast of Finland (the Prevalence, Prediction, and Prevention of Diabetes-Botnia [PPP-Botnia] Study), and in vitro, in human pancreatic islets. Islet function was assessed by measuring insulin and glucagon concentrations during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). The PPP-Botnia Study is a population-based study from the Botnia region of western Finland. Nondiabetic subjects (n= 4,654; fasting plasma glucose less than 7.0 mmol/L and 2-h plasma glucose less than 11.1 mmol/L) were included in the current study (3) (Supplementary Table 1). Blood samples were drawn at 0, 30, and 120 min of the OGTT. Insulin was measured using a fluoroimmunometric assay (AutoDelfia; PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) and serum glucagon using radioimmunoassay (Millipore, St. Charles, MO). Insulin sensitivity index (ISI) was calculated as 10,000/? (fasting P-glucose * fasting P-insulin * mean OGTTglucose* mean OGTTinsulin) (4). Insulin secretion was assessed as corrected insulin response (CIR) during OGTT {CIR = 100 * insulin at 30 min/[glucose at 30 min* (glucose 30 min - 3.89)]} (5) or as disposition index (DI), i.e., insulin secretion adjusted for insulin sensitivity (DI = CIR * ISI). Genotyping was performed either by matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry on the MassARRAY platform (Sequenom, San Diego, CA) or by an allelic discrimination method with a TaqMan assay on the ABI 7900 platform (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). We obtained an average genotyping success rate of 98.1%, and the average concordance rate, based on 10,578 (6.5%) duplicate comparisons, was 99.9%. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was fulfilled for all studied variants (P greater than 0.05). Glucose-stimulated insulin and glucagon secretion were performed in high (16.7 mmol/L) and low (1.0 mmol/L) glucose concentration in the medium as described previously (6) and were available from 56 nondiabetic human pancreatic islet donors. Given the limited number of donors for genetic analyses, the relationships between absolute genotypic means of insulin and glucagon concentrations and the 95% CI were plotted separately for different genotype carriers rather than contrasting mean differences in phenotypes between genotypes. Variables are presented as mean +/- SD and, if not normally distributed, as median (IQR). Genotype-phenotype correlations were studied using linear regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, and BMI. Nonnormally distributed variables were logarithmically (natural) transformed for analyses. All statistical analyses were performed with IBM SPSS Statistics version 19.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY) and PLINK version 1.07 (7,8). We observed the strongest effect on reduced insulin secretion for theMTNR1Brs10830963 (CIRP= 4.3 * 10-22; DIP= 3.4 * 10-32). Additionally, we confirmed that genetic variants inCDKAL1(CIRP= 1.6 * 10-7; DIP= 2.5 * 10-11),HHEX(CIRP= 1.4 * 10-4; DIP= 0.0021),GIPR(CIRP= 3.1 * 10-4; DIP= 0.0061),GCK(CIRP= 0.0010; DIP= 9.2 * 10-4),KCNQ1(CIRP= 0.0032; DIP= 0.0054),CDKN2A/2B(CIRP= 0.016; DIP= 0.0072),FADS1(CIRP= 6.6 * 10-4),IGF2BP2(DIP= 0.0013),JAZF1(DIP= 0.015),KCNJ11(CIRP= 0.019),PPARG(DIP= 0.023),ZFAND6(CIRP= 0.026),CHCHD2P9(DIP= 0.039),ARAP1(CIRP= 0.039), andBCL11A(CIRP= 0.048) were associated with reduced insulin secretion (Supplementary Table 2). The variants inMTNR1B(P= 6.3 * 10-4),CHCHD2P9(P= 0.011),FADS1(P= 0.013),PPARG(P= 0.041), andCDKAL1(P= 0.042) were associated with reduced insulin sensitivity (Supplementary Table 3). To explore whether these genetic variants would also influence alpha-cell function, we analyzed glucagon concentrations during OGTT. The variants inBCL11A(P= 0.0069),HHEX(P= 0.0096),ZBED3(P= 0.033), andHNF1A(P= 0.047) were associated with elevated fasting glucagon levels, whereas variants inCRY2(P= 0.0021),IGF2BP2(P= 0.0036), andTSPAN8(P= 0.034) were associated with reduced fasting glucagon levels. Furthermore, variants inIGF1(P= 0.0048),ZBED3(P= 0.0094), andNOTCH2(P= 0.016) were associated with increased postprandial glucagon levels and the variant inKCNJ11(P= 0.027) with decreased postprandial glucagon levels (Supplementary Table 4). We plotted the effects of the tested genetic variants on CIR and ISI (Fig. 1). Most SNPs were related to insulin secretion and sensitivity in a linear fashion, with SNPs in theMTNR1B,CDKAL1,GCK,CDKN2A/2B, andPPARGloci in the lower left quadrant, reflecting both impaired insulin secretion and action, withMTNR1Bbeing the most extreme. In contrast, variants inGIPR,FADS1,CAMK1D, andTCF7L2showed relatively high insulin sensitivity despite low insulin secretion. A genotype-centric analysis (Supplementary Fig. 1) also showed that homozygous carriers ofMTNR1B,CDKAL1, andGCKrisk genotypes had CIR values below the values expected from ISI values, whereas TT carriers ofTCF7L2showed rather high insulin sensitivity.

Effect sizes are betas from linear regression adjusted for age, sex, and BMI. Whereas most genetic variants either increased insulin secretion or insulin sensitivity, those inMTNR1B,CDKAL1, andGCKwere located to the lower left quadrant, reflecting both impaired insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity, withMTNR1Bbeing the most extreme. In contrast,GIPRandFADS1showed relatively high insulin sensitivity despite low insulin secretion. KCNQ1 represents rs2237895, andKCNQ1* represents rs231362. Black circles,P less than 0.05; white circles,P greater than 0.05. The variant inMTNR1Bshowed both high fasting glucose and insulin levels (Fig. 2andSupplementary Tables 5 and 6). At the same glucose level,CHCHD2P9showed the highest andFADS1the lowest fasting insulin concentration, whereas at the same fasting insulin concentration,FTOshowed the lowest andGCKthe highest fasting glucose levels. Homozygous carriers of theTCF7L2risk variant had the lowest insulin levels, whereas homozygous carriers ofHMGA2showed the highest insulin levels (Supplementary Fig. 2). These differences were also partially seen at 2 h of the OGTT.

B: The relationship between 2-h insulin and 2-h glucose. GCK,CDKAL1,ZBED3, andMTNR1Ball showed high postprandial glucose levels despite elevated insulin levels. The highest fasting glucose level related to glucagon level was seen forMTNR1B(Fig. 3andSupplementary Fig. 3), which was also reflected by high fasting and 2-h insulin-to-glucose ratios (Supplementary Table 7andSupplementary Figs. 4 and 5). In line with previous reports, theTCF7L2variant showed low glucagon levels (9) and homozygous T-allele carriers showed high fasting and 2-h glucose levels, despite low insulin-to-glucagon ratio.

The highest fasting glucose level related to glucagon level was seen forMTNR1B. IGF2BP2andCRY2showed reduced glucagon secretion, whereasBCL11AandHHEXwere associated with increased fasting glucagon. B: The relationship between 2-h glucagon and 2-h glucose. ZBED3,IGF1, andNOTCH2showed elevated whereasKCNJ11showed decreased postprandial glucagon secretion. The risk allele carriers of variants inCAMK1D,TCF7L2,GIPR,TSPAN8, andKLF14showed lower glucagon levels whereas the risk allele carriers ofCDKAL1,BCL11A,CRY2,FADS1,NOTCH2,HMGA2andGCKshowed higher glucagon levels than expected from the 95% CI of the relationship between mean values of insulin and glucagon concentrations measured at normal glucose levels. At high glucose, carriers of the risk alleles atDGKB,GIPR,JAZF1,CDKN2A/2B,HMGA2, andNOTCH2displayed high glucagon levels, whereas those ofTCF7L2,CAMK1D,KLF14,FTO, andZBED3showed lower glucagon levels (Fig. 4). Relationship between glucagon and insulin secretion in human pancreatic islets at low and high glucose levels. A: Secretion at low glucose (1 mmol/L). The risk allele carriers of variants inCAMK1D,TCF7L2,GIPR,TSPAN8, andKLF14showed lower glucagon secretion, whereas the risk allele carriers ofCDKAL1,BCL11A,CRY2,FADS1,NOTCH2,HMGA2, andGCKshowed glucagon levels above the expected 95% CI of the relationship between insulin and glucagon secretion. B: Secretion at high glucose (16.7 mmol/L). The risk allele carriers ofDGKB,GIPR,JAZF1,CDKN2A/2B,HMGA2, andNOTCH2remained high glucagon secretion, whereas those ofFTO,CAMK1D,TCF7L2,KLF14, andZBED3had low glucagon. In the current study, we demonstrate that the effects of some of the genetic variants associated with type 2 diabetes and/or glycemic traits seem to involve the cross-talk between hormone secretion from the beta- and alpha-cells. The novel findings in the current study included the observed associations of variants in 10 loci with glucagon concentrations, of which 6 loci (HHEX, IGF2BP2,CDKAL1,FADS1,GCK, andCDKN2A/2B) were also associated with reduced insulin secretion. Effects of variants on the relationship between CIR and ISI were similar to those observed by Grarup et al. (10), but we also showed thatMTNR1BandCDKAL1were clear outliers with strong effects on both impaired insulin secretion and sensitivity. These analyses used beta-values that reflect fractions of the SDs. We therefore extended the analyses by analyzing the relationship between the absolute values of CIR and ISI in different genotype carriers, which allowed us to obtain a quantitative effect of SNPs. These analyses differ from those presented by Grarup et al. (10) as we now related the effect of the homozygous risk genotypes to the mean values of a reference population instead of expressing them as allelic changes in fraction of SDs. It can, of course, be questioned whether homozygosity for risk alleles would best describe their effect on this relationship, but it has the advantage that it allows us to show the absolute effects of the variants. Importantly, we show that many of the genetic variants seem to affect the relationship between insulin/glucagon secretion and blood glucose levels both at fasting and 2 h during OGTT. This would imply that in the risk carriers, reduced early insulin secretion in conjunction with impaired suppression of glucagon secretion and/or action would lead to increased risk of type 2 diabetes. An interesting finding was that, again,MTNR1Bwas different from the rest of the variants and showed elevated glucose despite high insulin-to-glucagon ratio. There is no obvious explanation for these findings apart from that the ratio between insulin and glucagon may be more important than the individual insulin and glucagon levels for the glucose-raising effect ofMTNR1B. Also,MTNR1Bis mostly expressed in beta-cells, whereasMTNR1Apredominates in alpha-cells. Until now, no variant in theMTNR1Agene has been associated with type 2 diabetes or elevated glucose levels. In keeping with a previous study (11), the rs7903146 variant inTCF7L2was associated with lower glucagon values both in vivo and in vitro. In contrast to some previous studies (12,13), we did not observe a significant reduction in fasting or glucose-stimulated insulin secretion for this variant in the current study. The PPP-Botnia Study is a population-based study including people 18-75 years of age, most of whom had normal glucose tolerance. In the previous studies, the effect on insulin secretion was clearly stronger in hyperglycemic individuals or in those who subsequently developed diabetes. The same was seen in the current study; if we restrict the analysis to hyperglycemic individuals (fasting plasma glucose greater than 5.5 mmol/L), we see a clear effect of theTCF7L2SNP on reduced insulin secretion (n= 1,440; beta = -0.109 [0.035];P= 0.002). This effect might be too small to fully explain the glucose-increasing effect of the SNP, nor is it easy to see an effect of reduced glucagon levels. One possibility is that theTCF7L2variant has effects on hepatic glucose production as previously shown (13-15), which cannot be explained by effects of glucagon on the liver. From the figures relating the mean values of fasting and 2-h insulin/glucagon with fasting and 2-h glucose concentrations (Supplementary Fig. 6), it was obvious that homozygous carriers ofHMGA2differed most from the others. Thus, although carriers of twoHMGA2risk alleles showed increased insulin secretion and decreased insulin sensitivity, possibly protecting them from type 2 diabetes, they demonstrated low insulin/glucagon, which in turn led to elevated glucose. In vitro, homozygous risk allele carriers showed a reduced suppressive effect of high glucose on glucagon secretion. HMGA2encodes for a nonhistone protein with structural DNA-binding domains and may act as a transcriptional regulating factor. The current data suggest that it may involve a complex interplay between islet function and insulin action. The current study also provides some novel insight for the potential mechanism by which theBCL11Avariant could increase the risk of type 2 diabetes. BCL11Ars243021 was originally identified as a risk variant for type 2 diabetes in the DIAGRAM+ meta-analysis (1). The protein encoded byBCL11Ais a zinc-finger protein with highest expression in the fetal brain and the adult central nervous system. Although its biological function is not fully elucidated, it might be involved in the signal transduction from cell to cell or in the neuronal regulation of hormonal secretion. Association of variants inBCL11Awith reduced insulin secretion has previously been reported (16). Here we report novel associations of aBCL11Avariant with increased glucagon levels in vivo. Additionally, in vitro, homozygous risk allele carriers of theBCL11Avariant had glucagon levels above the expected 95% CI of the relationship between insulin and glucagon secretion in human pancreatic islets. Together, results from the present paper and previous reports suggest that this variant might predispose to increased risk of type 2 diabetes via reduced insulin and increased glucagon concentrations. In conclusion, here we provide a comprehensive description of how common genetic variants associated with type 2 diabetes and/or glycemic traits influence insulin and glucagon secretion in vivo and in vitro in human pancreatic islets. The data clearly emphasize the need to consider effects on alpha-cell function when studying mechanisms by which these variants increase risk of type 2 diabetes.
