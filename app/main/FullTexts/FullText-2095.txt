Stripe rust, caused byPuccinia striiformisf. sp. tritici(Pst), is one of the most destructive diseases of wheat in the world, and China is the largest endemic area (KangNone, 2010). Utilization of disease-resistant varieties has proved to be the safest, most economical, and effective method to control stripe rust, and resistance gene cloning is vital for the development of resistant varieties. However, a big challenge for resistance breeding is thatPstisolates evolved very rapidly, leading to breakdown of widely used resistance genes-especially in China where most new destructive epidemics ofPsthave originated. Yr10(LarocheNone, 2000),Yr18(KrattingerNone, 2009), andYr36(FuNone, 2009) are the only stripe rust resistance genes cloned to date. Using the virus-inducing gene silencing (VIGS) approach,TaRLK-R1,-R2, and-R3(ZhouNone, 2007),TaHsp90.2andTaHsp90.3(G.F.WangNone, 2011),TaDAD2(X.J. WangNone, 2011),TaMCA4(WangNone, 2012), andTaRab7(LiuNone, 2012) have been characterized as the genes required for stripe rust resistance. However, no stripe rust resistance-improved transgenic wheat has been developed by using these genes, so their effect in breeding remains unknown. The stripe rust resistance geneYr26located on chromosome 1B was introduced fromTriticum turgitumcv. gamma-80 (MaNone, 2001), and has been widely used as the main gene resource in China since 2003. Yr26is a broad-spectrum resistance gene, but, more importantly,Yr26shows potential durable resistance. Thus cloning the genes related to stripe rust resistance fromYr26-containing wheat should help in understanding the mechanism of its resistance and in developing varieties resistant to stripe rust. Receptor-like proteins (RLPs) are cell surface receptors which contain an extracellular lecine-rich repeat (LRR) domain, a single transmembrane domain, and a small cytoplasmic tail (KruijtNone, 2005). SeveralRLPgenes are known to be involved in plant-pathogen interactions. The first identifiedRLPgene was tomatoCf-9that mediated resistance againstCladosporium fulvum(JonesNone, 1994), and several otherCfresistance genes have also been characterized to beRLPgenes (DixonNone, 1996, 1998). In tomato, twoVegenes involved in plant resistance against vascular wilt and twoLeEixgenes encoding receptors for the fungal elicitor were also reported to encode RLPs (KawchukNone, 2001;Ron and Avni, 2004). In apple,HcrVf2conferred resistance to the scab fungusVenturia inaequalis(BelfantiNone, 2004). InArabidopsis, threeRLPgenes were found to be involved in the resistance response, namelyAtRLP52(RamonellNone, 2005),AtRLP30(WangNone, 2008), andsnc2-1D(ZhangNone, 2010). Apart from defence against pathogens,RLPgenes also play significant roles in plant development. InArabidopsis,TWO MANY MOUTHS(TMM) was shown to be involved in stomatal patterning (Nadeau and Sack, 2002), whileCLAVATA2(CLV2) and its orthologueFASCINATED EAR2in maize were shown to be involved in meristem development (JeongNone, 1999;Taguchi-ShiobaraNone, 2001). Some research was also carried out to elucidate the mechanism of RLP-mediated resistance, such as theCf-mediated hypersensitive response (HR) in tomato (StulemeijerNone, 2007), and theVel-mediated signals in tomato and inArabidopsis(FradinNone, 2011). Due to the availability of genome sequences, manyRLPgenes have been identified from model species: there are 57 predictedRLPgenes distributed in 33 loci inArabidopsis, and 90RLPgenes distributed in 38 loci in rice (WangNone, 2008). However, despite being an important food crop, there have been few investigations ofRLPgenes in wheat. Identification ofRLPgenes is necessary for extensive study and better understanding of their biological functions in wheat. In the present study, anRLPgene,TaRLP1.1, was cloned and characterized as an important gene involved in stripe rust resistance. TaRLP1.1has a huge potential role in future genetic engineering for development of varieties resistant to stripe rust. Along withTaRLP1.1, a largeTaRLP1family was identified, which may facilitate better understanding of the evolution ofRLPgenes in wheat. Triticum aestivumL. cv. 92R137, Yuanfeng175, Neimai9, and R236 with the stripe rust resistance geneYr26, and cv. Yangmai158 susceptible to stripe rust were used in this study. R236 and Yangmai158 are near-isogenic lines. The seedlings were maintained and inoculated withPstCYR32, the predominant isolate in China (X.J. WangNone, 2011). Leaves were harvested at 0, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 72h post-inoculation (hpi) for RNA isolation. For chemical treatments, 3-week-old seedlings of cv. 92R137 were sprayed with 5mM salicylic acid (SA), 100 muMu methyl jasmonate (MeJA), 200 muMu ethylene (ET), or 7mM hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in 0.05% Tween-20 solution, and with 0.05% Tween-20 used as control. Leaves were harvested at 0, 0.5, 2, 6, 12, and 24 hpi for RNA isolation. Three independent biological replications were performed. The wheat GeneChip (part no. 900515, Affymetrix) was chosen to screen thePstresistance-responsive genes in theYr26-containing materials. Leaves of 2-week-old seedlings of resistant varieties 92R137 and R236 and susceptible Yangmai158 were collected at 0, 12, and 36 hpi withPstCYR32, respectively. In this study, the microarray was used only to screen some genes for the downstream functional analysis, so the hybridization of each sample was not repeated. However, two resistant lines were used to increase the credibility of the screened positive genes, and the near-isogenic lines were used to reduce the interference of the genetic background. The transcript profile of each sample was obtained using genechip hybridization conducted in the National Engineering Center for Biochip in Shanghai, China, according to the Affymetrix technical manual. Six separate comparisons (categories) were performed to identify the differentially expressed genes between different samples, namely 'R236-12h versus R236-0h', 'R236-36h versus R236-0h', '92R137-12h versus Yangmai158-12h', 'R236-12h versus Yangmai158-12h', '92R137-36h versus Yangmai158-36h', and 'R236-36h versus Yangmai158-36h'. For each category, probe sets were filtered for a fold change threshold of greater than 2.0 and a parametric two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) (Pless than 0.001) with false discovery rate (FDR) multiple testing correction at 5% was applied to identify statistically significant differentially expressed probe sets. Only when the signal ratio value was >2 was the corresponding probe regarded as up-regulated. A 2 mug aliquot of total RNA was used to synthesize the first-strand cDNA by the AMV reverse transcriptase. To evaluate the effectiveness of the gene silencing by VIGS, the expression ofTaRLP1.1was analysed by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) with a pair of primers (TaRLP1.1-RT,Supplementary Table S1available atJXBonline) specific toTaRLP1.1, using the 18S rRNA (18rRNA-RT,Supplementary Table S1) as the internal control. The reagents were from Takara (Japan), and the reaction was performed in the ABI 7500fast (ABI, USA). The responses of theTaRLP1.1gene to pathogen and chemical treatments, the expression of threePRgenes (Supplementary Table S1) in the gene-silenced and overexpressing plants, and the expression ofTaRLP1.1in the transgenic plants were analysed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR, using the tubulin gene (Tubulin-RT,Supplementary Table S1) as the internal control. PCR was performed in 25 mul of reaction mixture. The program used was as follows: 3min at 94 degrees C, followed by 27 cycles at 94 degrees C for 30 s, 55-60 degrees C for 30 s, and 72 degrees C for 40s, and then retained at 10 degrees C.The fragment ofTaRLP1.1, a homologue ofPst-up-regulated probe Ta.22666.2.S1_at in cv 92R137 and R236, was obtained by RT-PCR using the primers (Ta.22666.2.S1-EST,Supplementary Table S1atJXBonline) designed according to the probe. Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) was then conducted to obtain the full-length cDNA ofTaRLP1. 1 from cv. 92R137 inoculated for 36h using the SMARTTM RACE cDNA Amplification Kit (Clontech). Primers for 5'-RACE and 3'-RACE (TaRLP-RACE,Supplementary Table S1) were designed according to the fragment ofTaRLP1.1. To obtain the full-lengthTaRLP1.1, RT-PCR was performed with a pair of primers (TaRLP1.1-FL,Supplementary Table S1) designed based on the sequence of the 5' and 3' cDNA ends. The homologues ofTaRLP1.1in cv. Neimai9 and Yuanfeng175 were also amplified using the above primers. The genomic sequence ofTaRLP1.1, and of its homologues in cv. 92R137 and Yangmai158, was obtained with primers (TaRLP1.1-ORF,Supplementary Table S1) designed based on the full-length cDNA ofTaRLP1.1. The cDNA sequence was analysed using the software of the DNAMAN, BLAST, and ORF Finder. Protein sequences were analysed using PROSITE Scan (http://npsa-pbil.ibcp.fr/cgi-bin/npsa_automat.pl?page=npsa_prosite.html) for prediction of the conserved domains and motifs, SignalP (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/) for prediction of the signal peptide, and TMpred (http://www.ch.embnet.org/software/TMPRED_form.html) for prediction of the transmembrane region. The MEGA 4.0 software was used for construction of the phylogenetic tree. The cDNA fragments containing theTaRLP1.1open reading frame (ORF) were amplified by PCR with the specific primers containingNcoI andSacI enzyme sites (TaRLP1.1-SL,Supplementary Table S1atJXBonline), and then inserted to the 5' end of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) coding region in thepCaMV35S:GFPvector. The plasmid DNAs ofpCaMV35S:TaRLP1.1-GFPandpCaMV35S:GFPwere transformed into onion epidermal cells by particle bombardment as described (LiuNone, 2012), respectively. The GFP signal was detected using a confocal microscope (Leica, Germany). VIGS mediated byBarley stripe mosaic virus(BSMV) (ZhouNone, 2007) in 92R137 was adopted to investigate the potential involvement ofTaRLP1.1in the HR toPst. A 186bp cDNA fragment covering both part of the coding region and part of the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) was amplified with primers (TaRLP1.1-VIGS,Supplementary Table S1atJXBonline), and then was inserted in reverse orientation into theBSMV:gammavector to form the recombinant vectorBSMV:TaRLP1.1as. The second fully expanded leaves of the seedlings were infected with virusBSMV:TaRLP1.1as, usingBSMV:TaPDSasandBSMV:gammaas the controls. Three independent sets of inoculations were performed, with a total of 72 seedlings inoculated for each BSMV virus. For the control, 24 seedlings were mock-inoculated with 1* GPK buffer. At 10-12 d after virus inoculation, the fourth leaves were further treated withPstCYR32. At 15 d after pathogen inoculation, when extensive fungal growth was visible in Yangmai158, the infection types of stripe rust were examined in the gene-silenced leaves of 92R137. The fourth leaves were also sampled at 72 and 120 hpi withPstfor histological observation and gene silencing efficiency analysis. The ORF ofTaRLP1.1was amplified using the primers containingBamHI andSacI sites (TaRLP1.1-WT,Supplementary Table S1atJXBonline), and was then inserted into the plant expression vectorpBI220under the control of the 35S promoter to form the recombinant vectorpBI220:TaRLP1.1. Because there is no selective marker gene available in the vectorpBI220, another plant expression vectorpAHC25, containing the beta-glucuronidase gene (GUS) and the herbicide tolerance gene (Bar) driven by the ubiquitin (Ubi) promoter, was used as the co-transformation vector. ThepBI220:TaRLP1.1- andpAHC25-co-transformed wheat plants were produced by particle bombardment of calli cultured from immature embryos of susceptible Yangmai158 as described (XingNone, 2008). For screening theTaRLP1.1-transformed positive transgenic plants from the 238 regenerated plants, the root tips of 20 T1seeds from each T0plant were first stained with X-gluc (XingNone, 2008), and the targetTaRLP1.1was then detected by PCR using the DNA of the corresponding T0plant whose T1seeds showedGUSactivity. The target gene was also detected in the T1generation of the positive T0plants. To avoid interference from the endogenous homologous genes in Yangmai158, the forward primer (35S-F,Supplementary Table S1) was located in the 35S promoter, and the reverse primer (TaRLP1.1-R,Supplementary Table S1) was located in the targetTaRLP1.1gene. Stripe rust resistance of T1transgenic plants was evaluated via inoculation with urediniospores ofPstCYR32 using cv. Yangmai158 and 92R137 as the controls at the two-leaf stage as described by X.J. WangNone(2011). About 30 seedlings of the T1generation from each positive T0line were inoculated with CYR32 and kept in a dew chamber at 10 degrees C for 24h in darkness, and then grown in a growth chamber at 16/8h light/dark with diurnal temperatures gradually changing from 4 degrees C at 02:00h to 20 degrees C at 14:00h. Infection type data were recorded 18 d after inoculation based on the 0-9 scale described by X.J. WangNone(2011). Infection types of 0-3 were considered resistant, while those greater than 5 were considered susceptible. Wheat leaves infected with BSMV were sampled at 72 and 120 hpi withPstand stained as described (X.J. WangNone, 2011). Bleached leaf segments were examined with an Olympus BX-51 microscope (Olympus, Japan) for infection sites, and only those sites where substomatal vesicles had formed in the stomata were considered to be successfully penetrated. Autofluorescence of the mesophyll cells in the infected sites was measured as phenolic autofluorogen accumulation area by epifluorescence microscopy (excitation filter, 485nm; dichromic mirror, 510nm; and barrier filter, 520nm). The autofluorescence areas, hyphal length, and hyphal branches were calculated by DP-BSW software, and the final data of each index were the mean of at least 60 infection sites for each of the five randomly selected leaf segments per treatment. Standard deviations and a paired samplet-test for statistical analysis were performed with SAS software. To screen thePstresistance-related genes in wheat containing the stripe rust resistance geneYr26, microarrays were used to obtain the transcriptomes of seven samples, including two resistant varieties 92R137 and R236, and one susceptible cv. Yangmai158, with or withoutPstinoculation as described (X.J. WangNone, 2011). The data of six differentially expressed probes (2-fold up- and down-regulated andP-value less than =0.001) were consequently produced. Bioinformatics analysis showed that in total 35 probes were shared by all of the above six data groups, with 17 up-regulated and 18 down-regulated; thus 35 probes showed a differentially expressed pattern not only betweenPst-inoculated samples of resistant and susceptible lines, but also betweenPst-inoculated and uninoculated samples of the resistant lines. Among the 17 probes, Ta.22666.2.S1 and TaAffx.55699.1.S1_at were two putativeRLPgenes (Supplementary Table S2atJXBonline). Although there was no homology between Ta.22666.2.S1 and TaAffx.55699.1.S1, these two probes showed similarity to the different parts of the same genes in GenBank, indicating that they represented the sameRLPgene. RLPgenes have been reported to be involved in the defence responses to different pathogens; however, noRLPhas been identified in wheat, so the screenedRLPgene was selected as of interest for investigation of its function in stripe rust resistance. The homologue of Ta.22666.2.S1_at in cv. 92R137 inoculated with CYR32 was obtained by RT-PCR using the primers (Ta.22666.2.S1-EST,Supplementary Table S1atJXBonline) designed according to the probe Ta.22666.2.S1_at. The amplified fragment shared 99% similarity with Ta.22666.2.S1_at, so the homologue in cv. 92R137 was designated asTaRLP1.1, since it showed high homology with otherRLPgenes. The full-length sequence ofTaRLP1.1was further obtained by RACE from cv. 92R137, which was then verified by RT-PCR using the primers (TaRLP1.1-FL,Supplementary Table S1) designed based on the 5'- and 3'-UTR. The full length of theTaRLP1.1was 1273bp, which contained a putative 801bp ORF coding for 266 amino acids. The predicted primary structure of TaRLP1.1 comprised several conserved domains which have been identified in other RLPs (Supplementary Fig. S1A,BatJXBonline). Domain 'a' is a signal peptide, a hydrophobic N-terminus found in TaRLP1.1, which may target the protein to the cytoplasmic membrane. Domain 'b' is an LRR region with three imperfect copies of LRR; each one is a 23-25 amino acid consensus sequence [xLxxLxLSxNxLSGxIP] associated with protein-protein interactions (Jones and Jones, 1997). The presence of a glycine within the LRR is considered as the characteristic of extracytoplasmic proteins with the ability to recognize the extracellular pathogen ligands (JonesNone, 1994). As frequently observed in membrane-spanning proteins, a hydrophobic sequence with a predicted alpha-helix secondary structure (domain c, containing GxxxG-type motifs) is the putative transmembrane region, following a negatively charged extracytoplasmic domain (domain d) and followed by a positively charged cytoplasmic tail. In the short cytoplasmic tail domain, there is a 'Yxxphi' signal sequence, where 'phi' is an amino acid with a hydrophobic side chain, and this motif has been shown to stimulate receptor-mediated endocytosis and degradation of mammalian cell surface receptors (Ron and Avni, 2004;Kruijt,None, 2005). To determine whetherTaRLP1.1belonged to a gene family and whether there was a difference inTaRLP1.1between the resistant varity 92R137 and susceptible cv. Yangmai158, PCR was conducted using primers (TaRLP1.1-ORF,Supplementary Table S1atJXBonline) to identify the homologues ofTaRLP1.1in the DNA of both materials. In cv. 92R137, in addition toTaRLP1.1, another nineTaRLP1genes of different sizes were identified; and in cv. Yangmai158, eightTaRLP1genes of different sizes were identified (Supplementary Table S3). Sequence analysis showed thatTaRLP1None,TaRLP1None-None,TaRLP1NoneNone,TaRLP1NoneNone, andTaRLP1Noneexisted in both cv. 92R137 and Yangmai158; however, other genes were identified to be specific to each cultivar. The specific primers were designed based on the sequence of the above genes (Supplementary Table S1atJXBonline) and were used for gene chromosome location in cv. Chinese Spring-derived nulli-tetrasomic lines. TaRLP1.1was located to chromosome 3D,TaRLP1NoneNoneto 3B, andTaRLP1Noneto 3A (Supplementary Fig. S2). The result indicated that theTaRLP1gene family may be located in the homoeologous group 3 chromosomes. The result of the multisequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis of theRLPgenes from common wheat suggested thatTaRLP1is a rapidly evolving gene family due to single nucleotide variation, deletion or insertion, and recombination (Supplementary Fig. S3atJXBonline) (DixonNone, 1998). For example, compared withTaRLP1None,TaRLP1Nonewas produced by one missing nucleotide,TaRLP1Nonewas the outcome of a three-nucleotide (TCA) insertion intoTaRLP1None, andTaRLP1Nonewas the product of a nine-nucleotide insertion (CCTATCC and TAA) intoTaRLP1None. Gene duplication occurred onTaRLP1NoneandTaRLP1None, resulting in more members of both types of genes in wheat (Supplementary Fig. S4). Recombination between the homologous regions of different members of one gene cluster is a common event that produces new genes. In this study,TaRLP1NoneNonewas the product of recombination betweenTaRLP1NoneandTaRLP1NoneNone: the first half ofTaRLP1NoneNonewas identical toTaRLP1None, and the second half was identical toTaRLP1NoneNone. Polymorphism of the DNA sequence leads directly to the variation in the putative protein sequences (Supplementary Fig. S5atJXBonline). Compared with TaRLP1.1, TaRLP1800-1and TaRLP1800-2are two truncated proteins due to one nucleotide missing and pre-stop in the reading frame; while in TaRLP1738there were 22 amino acids missing. Although many variations were detected, the effect on gene function needs to be elucidated. As to the homology of TaRLP1.1 with other putative RLPs, TaRLP1.1 showed the highest similarity ( greater than 70% identity) to its homologues from other monocots (Supplementary Fig. S6AatJXBonline); however, it showed the lowest sequence similarity toArabidopsisAtRLP44 (38% identity) (Supplementary Fig. S6B). To determine how manyTaRLP1genes were expressed in both the resistant and susceptible plants, the primers used to amplify the homologous gene from 92R137 and Yangmai158 were also used to amplify the expressed genes from the cDNA of the cv. 92R137 and Yangmai158. There were 22 positive clones from the cv. 92R137 sequenced, and threeTaRLP1genes were found to be expressed:TaRLP1.1(19 of 22),TaRLP1NoneNone(two of 22), andTaRLP1None(one of 22). Twenty positive clones from cv. Yangmai158 were sequenced, and twoRLPgenes,TaRLP1NoneNone(19 of 20) andTaRLP1NoneNone(one of 20), were detected as expressed. In two other resistant cultivars, Neimai 9 and Yuanfeng 175,TaRLP1.1was also detected as the predominant transcript as in cv. 92R137. Sequence analysis showed thatTaRLP1NoneNoneproduced a truncated 57 amino acid protein due to a missing nucleotide compared withTaRLP1.1. TaRLP1NoneNonealso produced a 266 amino acid protein; however, the similarity with TaRLP1.1 was only 88%. TaRLP1Noneproduced a 270 amino acid protein, and similarity with TaRLP1.1 was 81% (Supplementary Fig. S5atJXBonline). TaRLP1.1was the dominant expressed gene specifically in theYr26-containing cv. 92R137, Neimai 9, and Yuanfeng 175; thus, it was proposed thatTaRLP1.1may play an important role in theYr26-mediated resistance pathway. BecauseTaRLP1.1was the dominant transcript in cv. 92R137 and another twoYr26-containing materials based on expression analysis, to examine further whether the expression ofTaRLP1.1was really induced byPst, semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis was conducted using primers (TaRLP1.1-RT,Supplementary Table S1atJXBonline) specific toTaRLP1.1. It was found thatTaRLP1.1was significantly up-regulated in cv. 92R137 at 12 hpi withPst, and reached a peak at 36 hpi (Fig. 1A). In another twoYr26-containing cultivars, Neimai 9 and Yuanfeng175,TaRLP1.1was also induced by CYR32 and reached a peak at 72 and 36 hpi, respectively. However, no transcript was detected in susceptible Yangmai158. Therefore,TaRLP1.1may play an important role in resistance to stripe rust fungus, and perhaps take part in the signal transduction mediated byYr26. Evaluation of expression changes ofTaRLP1.1in response to biotic (stripe rust infection), and chemical treatments (SA, ET, MeJA, and H2O2) stresses in wheat seedlings by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Thetubulingene was used as the internal control. (A)TaRLP1.1was up-regulated byPstCYR32 in resistant wheat (cv. 92R137, Neimai 9, and Yuanfeng 175), while it was not induced in susceptible cv. Yangmai158. (B)TaRLP1.1was induced by SA and H2O2, but not by ET and MeJA. Seedlings of cv. 92R137 were treated with exogenous chemicals-SA (5mM), MeJA (100 muMu), ET (200 muMu), and H2O2(7mM)-for analysis of the responses ofTaRLP1.1by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. TheTaRLP1.1was substantially up-regulated by both SA and H2O2treatments; however, there was no response to the MeJA and ET (Fig. 1B). The subcellular localization ofTaRLP1.1was studied using the constructed fused protein TaRLP1.1-GFP driven by the CaMV 35S promoter by the transcient expression system in onion epidermal cells. The result showed that the green signal produced by GFP protein alone was uniformly distributed throughout the cell; however, the green signal produced by the fused protein TaRLP1.1-GFP was clearly localized only to the cytomembrane (Supplementary Fig. S7atJXBonline). The subcellular localization indicated that TaRLP1.1 was localized to the membrane as predicted by its transmembrane 'GxxxG' motif and TaRLP1.1 may act as a receptor to receive the stimuli from outside of the cell in the resistance pathway. To evaluate the function ofTaRLP1.1, a BSMV-based VIGS approach (ZhouNone, 2007) was used to silence the genes in the stripe rust resistance cv. 92R137. Fifteen days afterBSMV:TaPDSasinoculatation, leaf bleaching was observed due to PDS gene silencing, indicating that the VIGS system for gene functional analysis was successfully silencing the target gene (Fig. 2A). The efficiency of VIGS was analysed by quantitative RT-PCR using the fourth leaves of wheat seedlings, and expression levels ofTaRLP1.1were reduced by 81% and 69% in leaves challenged withBSMV:TaRLP1.1asat 72 and 120 hpi, respectively, compared with the control inoculated withBSMV:gamma(Fig. 2B). At 2 weeks afterPstisolate CYR32 inoculation, a robust HR was observed on leaves infected withBSMV:gamma, or mock-inoculated only with GPK buffer. However, fungal sporulation emerged only on fourth leaves previously infected withBSMV:TaRLP1.1as(Fig. 2C). Functional characterization ofTaRLP1.1by the BSMV-based VIGS approach. (A) Successful virus infection. Mild chlorotic mosaic symptoms were observed on the fourth leaves inoculated withBSMV:gammaorBSMV:TaRLP1. 1asat 10 days post-inoculation (dpi). Photobleaching displayed on leaves infected withBSMV:TaPDSasat 15 dpi. Typical photographs were taken at 15 d after virus inoculation. (B) The expression level ofTaRLP1.1was decreased dramatically at both 72h and 120h after CYR32 inoculation in theBSMV:TaRLP1.1as-infected plants. (C) The resistance toPstCYR32 was compromised in theBSMV:TaRLP1.1as-infected plants, and the rust sori were observed in theTaRLP1.1-silenced leaves. The photographs were taken 2 weeks after fungal inoculation. In the incompatible host-pathogen interaction, autofluorescence due to the accumulation of phenylpropanoid compounds is common, and usually correlated with the HR. Because the incompatible interaction of 92R137 andPstCYR32 was accompanied by a sharp HR, an investigation was carried out to determine what would happen to the HR or phenolic autofluorogen accumulation when the compatible interaction formed in theTaRLP1.1-silenced 92R137. Detailed histological changes were also observed at 72h and 120h afterPstCYR32 inoculation of theBSMV:TaRLP1.1as-,BSMV:gamma-, and mock-infected plants, and four parameters were measured: proportion of the infection sites producing phenolic autofluorogen accumulation, autofluorescence area, hyphal length, and hyphal branches (Fig. 3). In the control plants infected withBSMV:gammaor mock infected, a large proportion of infection sites producing phenolic autofluorogen accumulation could be detected (Fig. 3A), and a large autofluorescence area could be observed at 72h [Fig. 4A(a1, b1)] or 120h [Fig. 4B(a1, b1)] afterPstCYR32 inoculation (Fig. 3B). In test plants infected withBSMV:TaRLP1.1as, the proportion of infection sites producing phenolic autofluorogen accumulation and the autofluorescence area were significantly (P less than 0.001) lower than for control leaves at 72h [Figs 3A,B,4A(c1)] and 120h [Figs 3A,4B,B(c1)] after CYR32 inoculation, and hyphal length was significantly (0.001) longer than for the control [Figs 3C,4A(c),4B(c)]. However, there was no significant difference (0.05) in hyphal branching between control and test plants (Fig. 3D). These results indicated that knocking downTaRLP1.1decreased the autofluorescence areas generated at infection sites, and the HR was compromised. Quantitative comparisons of the percentage of the infection sites producing phenolic autofluorogen accumulation, average area of autofluorescence, and average linear length of hyphae at 72 and 120 hpi after CYR32 inoculation on leaves pre-infected withBSMV:TaRLP1.1asorBSMV:gamma, or mock infected. The data from each treatment were calculated from at least 60 infection sites on each seedling. Statistical significance was determined using ANOVA andt-test. Mean values followed by different letters are significantly different from each other (b* indicatesP less than 0.001 and b indicatesP less than 0.05).

Histological observation in wheat cv. 92R137 at 72 hpi (A) and 120 hpi (B) afterPstCYR32 inoculation in theBSMV:gamma- (a, a1), mock- (b, b1), andBSMV:TaRLP1.1as- (c, c1) pre-infected leaves. The same infection site was observed by white fluorescence microscopy for fungal growth (a, b, c) and epifluorescence microscopy for hypersensitive cell death (a1, b1, c1). (A) The spreading of secondary hyphae was suppressed (a, b), and mesophyll cells at the infection sites showed strong phenolic autofluorogen accumulation (a1, b1). However, secondary hyphae were formed (c) and autofluorescence was not obvious (c1) in theBSMV:TaRLP1.1as-infected leaves. Bars=20 mum. (B) Secondary hyphae were longer in theBSMV:TaRLP1.1as-infected leaves (c) than in theBSMV:gamma- (a) and mock- (b) infected leaves. However, the area of autofluorescence was smaller in theBSMV:TaRLP1.1as-infected leaves (c1) than in theBSMV:gamma- (a1) and mock- (b1) infected leaves. Bars=100 mum. SV, substomatal vesicle; IH, infection hypha; HMC, haustorial mother cell; SH, secondary hyphae; PAA, phenolic autofluorogen accumulation. The loss of resistance usually correlated with the decreased expression of some defence-related genes. Some pathogenesis-related genes were tested in theTaRLP1.1-silenced plants and controls. Expression levels ofTaPR1,TaPR2, andTaPR5were decreased inTaRLP1.1knocked-down leaves at 72 or 120 hpi, in contrast toBSMV:gamma-infected control (Supplementary Fig. S8atJXBonline). PR1,PR2, andPR5are usually considered to be marker genes of the SA pathway, so their decreased expression inTaRLP1.1-silenced plants implied some damage to the SA pathway. The function ofTaRLP1.1was further studied by developingTaRLP1.1-overexpressing transgenic plants. Susceptible cv. Yangmai158 is a near-isogenic line ofYr26-containing resistant cv. R236, and cv. Yangmai158 lacksTaRLP1.1. Additionally, cv. Yangmai158 is a good variety for tissue culture, and soTaRLP1.1was transformed into cv. Yangmai158 by particle bombardment in this study. ThepBI220:TaRLP1.1was co-transformed with theGUSgene-containing vectorpAHC-25. GUS staining using the root tips of the T1generation seeds and target gene detection in the T0generation was used to identify positive transgenic plants-22 T0plants were determined to be positive transgenic plants (Supplementary Fig. S9A,BatJXBonline). Expression analysis in the T1generation showed thatTaRLP1.1was successfully overexpressed in the transgenic plants (Supplementary Fig. S9C). Evaluation of the resistance toPstCYR32 was performed using the T1plants of each positive T0plant. The second leaves of plants were inoculated withPstisolate CYR32, and 2 weeks later robust hypersensitive cell death was observed-the transgenic plants showed high resistance to CYR32 (Fig. 5A). Because of heterozygosity ofTaRLP1.1in the T0generation, theTaRLP1.1was segregated in T1generation seedlings, and only those plants transformed withTaRLP1.1showed increased resistance with resistance of grade 2-4, while the recipient Yangmai158 showed the highest level of susceptibility of grade 9 (Fig. 5B;Supplementary Fig. S10) atJXBonline. Stripe rust resistance evaluation ofTaRLP1.1-transformed plants. (A) T1transgenic plants from different T0plants showed a varied level of resistance toPstCYR32.

To determine whether the HR contributed to increased resistance in theTaRLP1.1transgenic plants, the proportion of infection sites producing phenolic autofluorogen accumulation, the autofluorescence area, and the hyphal length at the infection site were investigated by histological observations at 120h after CYR32 inoculation. A higher percentage of infection sites producing phenolic autofluorogen accumulation (73.8%), a larger area of autofluorescence (40 798.8 mum2), and shorter hyphae (147.6 mum) at infection sites were observed in transgenic plants compared with corresponding values of 59.5%, 11 754.2 mum2, and 348.2 mum in Yangmai158 (Fig. 6A,B). It is proposed that the increased resistance of transgenic plants was closely related to the HR. Histological observation of the hyphal development and phenolic autofluorogen accumulation at the infection sites betweenPstCYR32 andTaRLP1.1-overexpressing transgenic plants at 120 hpi using the susceptible cv. Yangmai158 as the control. (A) In cv. Yangmai158, the hyphae elongated normally, and there was almost no autofluorescence at the infection site. However, in transgenic plants, the fungal growth was slower, and autofluorescence was obvious at the infection sites. The same infection site was observed by white fluorescence or epifluorescence microscopy. Bars=100 mum. SV, substomatal vesicle; SH, secondary hyphae; PAA, phenolic autofluorogen accumulation. (B) Quantitative comparisons of the percentage of infection sites producing phenolic autofluorogen accumulation, the average area of autofluorescence, and average linear length of hyphae emerging on the leaves of infection sites. Means (+/- SE) were calculated using the measurements from six seedlings, and at least 30 infection sites for each seedling. Significance was determined according to the paired samplet-test method (b* indicatesP less than 0.001 and b indicatesP less than 0.05). In addition,TaPR1,TaPR2, andTaPR5were induced in transgenic wheat leaves challenged by CYR32 at 72 and 120 hpi (Supplementary Fig. S11atJXBonline). These results suggest thatTaRLP1.1played a positive role in plant defence reactions and enhanced resistance to thePstfungus. Plants are exposed to diverse pathogen infection, and various responses are activated to deal with such attacks. Among the complex defence networks, the signal pathways mediated byRLPgenes have recently been found to be required in the response to pathogen attacks inArabidopsisand tomato. However, noRLPgenes have been studied in monocots. Wheat is one of the world's most important crops and is adversely affected byPst. In this study, aTaRLP1.1gene was isolated from a stripe rust-resistant variety. The putative protein structure ofTaRLP1.1indicated that TaRLP1.1 was a typical RLP, and strong evidence suggested thatTaRLP1.1, a member of theRLPgene family, was involved in the defence response to stripe rust. TaRLP1.1was induced in all four tested and genetically diverseYr26-containing resistant wheat varieties afterPstinoculation, but not in susceptible cv. Yangmai158. Furthermore, a gene silencing experiment indicated thatTaRLP1.1was required for the full resistance toPst, while the complementary experiment showed that overexpression ofTaRLP1.1could dramatically improve resistance. Histological analysis implied that it had important roles in HR regulation and activation ofPRgenes. The above results indicate thatTaRLP1.1was involved in the stripe rust resistance. SA, JA, and ET are signalling molecules to regulate complex defence responses by inducing PR genes, and the SA signal pathway is generally correlated with biotrophic pathogen defences and HR (SpoelNone, 2008). In the present study, strong HR could be induced, and thePRgenes (PR1,PR2, andPR5-the marker genes of SA) were up-regulated in theYr26-containing wheat after the biotrophicPstinfection; thus the SA pathway probably participated in defence. TaRLP1.1expression was dominantly induced by exogenous SA; meanwhile, the extent of HR and the expression ofPR1,PR2, andPR5changed along with the expression abundance ofTaRLP1.1. This suggests thatTaRLP1.1participated in the SA-mediated signalling pathway in the wheat-stripe rust interactions. TheCftypeRLPgenes were characterized as disease resistance genes (JonesNone, 1994;DixonNone, 1996,1998). In the present study, the silencing ofTaRLP1.1resulted in decreased resistance of cv. 92R137; however, the level of susceptibility was not as serious as that of the susceptible cv. Yangmai158, Conversely, overexpression ofTaRLP1.1increased the resistance of cv. Yangmai158, but not to a level as high as that of cv. 92R137. Thus, gene expression analysis and functional evaluation indicated thatTaRLP1.1was a potential downstream factor involved in theYr26-mediated signal pathway. In addition to the signal pathway containingTaRLP1.1, there are probably other branches of signal pathways contributing to full resistance toPstmediated byYr26. CYR32 is the most frequently identified isolate ofPst, accounting for a frequency of 29.6% throughout China. More importantly, with broad virulence and high fitness, CYR32 will probably cause widespread epidemics of stripe rust in the near future (KangNone, 2010). The identification ofTaRLP1.1as a positive regulator of the HR and an enhancer of resistance toPstCYR32 may provide molecular targets for the development of varieties resistant to stripe rust. The spectrum of resistance will be determined in the higher generations ofTaRLP1.1transgenic plants using morePstisolates. Protein-protein interaction cascades are crucial for signalling pathways. Like other resistance proteins, the LRR domain of RLPs is widely involved in disease resistance by binding to pathogen elicitors or other proteins in the plants to activate downstream signals (KruijtNone, 2005). The 'GxxxG' conserved motif in the transmembrane regions ofRLPgenes is likely to be involved in protein-protein interactions, as found in the study of theCf-RLPgenes, and this protein interaction plays a critical role inRLPsignal transduction from the extracellular to the cytoplasmic space (StulemeijerNone, 2007).The binding protein and the mechanism of the resistance mediated byTaRLP1.1remain to be elucidated. Thus, transgenic plants of TaRLP1.1 fused with a Myc-tag in the C-terminus are being produced to facilitate the search for the interacting proteins of TaRLP1.1. The disease resistance genes are usually distributed on chromosomes as clusters, and this has been widely shown concerning theNBS-LRRand someRLKresistance genes. ForRLPresistance genes, a similar manner of gene organization was identified in several cases; for example, theCf-2gene cluster inLycopersicon(nowSolanum)pimpinellifoliumincluded threeHcr2genes (DixonNone, 1996), and theCf-5gene cluster inLycopersicon esculentum(nowSolanum lycopersicum) var. cerasiformeincluded four members (DixonNone, 1998). InArabidopsis, 57RLPgenes were distributed on 33 loci, and in rice 90RLPgenes were distributed on 38 loci (WangNone, 2008). In the present study, 10 members ofTaRLP1in resistant cv. 92R137 and eight members in susceptible cv. Yangmai158 were identified, and it was proposed that theTaRLP1family clustered on the homoeologous group 3 chromosomes. To adapt to the quick evolution of the pathogen, disease resistance genes often undergo dramatic evolution, such as duplication, deletion/insertion, and recombination, to produce new members to recognize the new pathogens. The gene structure and function analysis ofCfgenes showed that gene duplication and recombination played an important role in the evolution ofRLPgenes. In some cases, the duplicated gene preserved the function of the original genes (DixonNone, 1996). InL. pimpinellifolium,Hcr9is the product of recombination betweenHcr9-9DandCf-9(KruijtNone, 2004). In theTaRLP1family, there were identical members shared by the two materials; however, there were also some members specific to the individual materials. Gene duplication, deletion/insertion, and recombination were identified in the gene evolution of theTaRLP1family. Gene clusters are considered to be the outcome of co-evolution of host and pathogen, and different members of a gene cluster may be aimed at different virulent races (BhullarNone, 2009). In a gene cluster, some members confer resistance to available pathogen races, while others have no identified resistance function and represent a reservoir to deal with new emerging races or producing new genes (KruijtNone, 2004). For example, among the four members in theCf-5family of cherry tomato,Hcr2-5Cis the only determinant of Avr5 recognition (DixonNone, 1998). In this study, a number ofTaRLP1members were identified in wheat, but only two and three were expressed in cv. Yangmai158 and 92R137 under the tested conditions, respectively. It will be interesting to study the expression pattern of the otherTaRLP1genes, and their response to stimuli. In conclusion, strong evidence in the present study suggested thatTaRLP1.1plays an important role in the stripe rust defence response in the monocot wheat. Furthermore, the rapid evolution of theTaRLP1family was revealed. This work supplied a good gene resource for genetic engineering in wheat breeding. Supplementary data are available atJXBonline.
