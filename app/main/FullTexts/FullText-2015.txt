Prostate cancer is a major cause of cancer-related death (JemalNone, 2011). However, disease course is highly variable and difficult to predict: a significant proportion of cases are indolent and do not require curative treatment, whereas others are characterised by high metastatic potential and require aggressive, early clinical intervention. Unfortunately, current clinicopathological models, which incorporate parameters such as Gleason score, tumour stage and serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentration, are unable to accurately differentiate between indolent and life-threatening cancers at the time of diagnosis. Subsequently, there is considerable overtreatment of indolent disease, accompanied by high morbidity. The issue of overtreatment has been further compounded by PSA testing (AndrioleNone, 2009;SchroderNone, 2009;ChouNone, 2011). More accurate prognostic tools would have a major impact on the clinical management of prostate cancer. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-protein-coding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression by binding to complementary sequences in target mRNAs and mediating translational repression and/or mRNA degradation. A recent estimate suggests that ?60% of all protein-coding genes are directly targeted by miRNAs (FriedmanNone, 2009). It is therefore unsurprising that miRNAs have demonstrated functions in a diverse array of processes, including development, cell behaviour, stress responses and survival (Bushati and Cohen, 2007). In addition to their roles in normal physiology, miRNAs are frequently dysregulated in cancer (Croce, 2009). This paradigm suggests that miRNAs could be clinically useful cancer biomarkers, a concept recently validated by the launch of miRNA-based diagnostic tests for thyroid and pancreatic cancer by Asuragen. The potential of miRNAs for biomarker applications was further reinforced by recent research showing that cancer-specific miRNAs are detectable in cell-free blood fluids such as serum and plasma (LawrieNone, 2008;MitchellNone, 2008). Since those seminal studies, circulating miRNAs have emerged as promising biomarkers for various malignancies (WeilandNone, 2012). In relation to prostate cancer, most studies to date have focused on identifying circulating miRNAs that can assist in diagnosis or the stratification of metastatic from localised disease (KellyNone, 2012;SelthNone, 2012). While a subset of these molecules have been linked to prognostic clinical variables (BraseNone, 2011;SelthNone, 2011), the utility of circulating miRNAs to predict disease course at the time of diagnosis remains inconclusive. In this study, we report on the ability of circulating miRNAs to predict biochemical recurrence (BCR) in men with localised prostate cancer treated by radical prostatectomy (RP). The Australian Prostate Cancer BioResource (APCB) collected biological samples and clinical data from men undergoing RP at the Royal Adelaide Hospital (RAH) and St Vincent's Hospital (SVH), Sydney. All men gave written consent for sample and ongoing data collection, and practices and procedures were approved by the RAH and SVH Human Research Ethics Committees. Blood was collected according to the APCB's standard operating procedures, which have been reviewed within Australia and by the International Society of Biological and Environmental Repositories. Samples were collected in 8-ml Serum Separator Gel Vacuette tubes (Greiner BioOne, Frickenhausen, Germany; catalogue number 455078), allowed to clot for ?30 min at room temperature and centrifuged at room temperature for 10 min at 2500 g. Serum was aliquoted into Nunc cryovials (ThermoFisher Scientific, San Jose, CA, USA), snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 degrees C. Patients were followed post-operatively by their surgeons on a monthly basis until satisfactory urinary continence was obtained and then at 3-month intervals until the end of the first year, at 6-monthly intervals to 5 years and yearly thereafter. Relapse was defined by the following criteria: biochemical disease progression with a serum PSA concentration of 0.2 ng ml-1increasing over a 3-month period. Total RNA was extracted from serum essentially as described previously (SelthNone, 2011), with some minor modifications. Before extraction, serum was centrifuged at 3000 gfor 5 min at 4 degrees C and transferred to a new 1.5 ml tube. A serum to Qiazol ratio of 1 : 5 was used to denature the samples. For the samples profiled by high-throughput qRT-PCR, miRNAs were extracted from 500 mul serum spiked with 25 fmol syntheticcel-miR-39(Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA, USA) and eluted in 35 mul RNase-free water. For the validation samples, miRNAs were extracted from 200 mul serum spiked with 25 fmol syntheticcel-miR-39and eluted in 100 mul RNase-free water. Additionally, 1 mug of yeast transfer RNA (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) was added to the smaller validation serum samples as a carrier. Serum samples from two disparate patient groups - men who experienced rapid BCR following RP and men who were progression free at the time of last follow-up - were profiled using TaqMan Low-Density Array (TLDA) Human MicroRNA A+B Cards Set v3.0 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), as per the manufacturer's instructions. We used 3 mul of serum miRNA as input for the Megaplex reverse transcription (RT) reactions. After RT and pre-amplification, quantitative PCR was carried out on an Applied Biosystems 7900HT. Cycle threshold values were calculated using SDS 2.4 software (Applied Biosystems) with manual baseline (3-15) and threshold (0.2) settings. Undetected miRNAs (average quantification cycle value (Cq) greater than 35 in either the BCR or no BCR groups) were removed from the analysis. Normalisation of the data was as follows: (1) the A plates and B plates were normalised to each other using the Cq values forU6snRNA, which is amplified on both plates; (2) all data were then scaled to the spiked-incel-miR-39to correct for differences in extraction efficiency, (3) finally, the mean Cq value of all miRNAs with a Cq value of less than 30 for each array was determined and used to normalise the arrays. This global normalisation strategy improves upon methods based on internal reference genes (MestdaghNone, 2009;DeoNone, 2011). Raw and normalised data have been deposited in Gene Expression Omnibus (accession number GSE47125). To validate miRNAs identified by TLDA profiling, TaqMan Human miRNA assays (Applied Biosystems) were used to measure the levels ofmiR-141,miR-146b-3p,miR-194andmiR-375(assay numbers 000463, 002361, 000493 and 000564, respectively) in 70 independent patient serum samples enriched for men who had experienced recurrence post-RP. Spiked-incel-miR-39(assay number 000200) was used for normalisation purposes. TaqMan MicroRNA Reverse Transcription Kits (Applied Biosystems) were used to synthesise cDNA from 4 mul of total serum RNA (in 10 mul reactions). The miRNA-specific stem-loop primers formiR-141,miR-146b-3p,miR-194,miR-375andcel-miR-39were pooled, dried down in a speed-vac, resuspended in RNase-free water and used at a final concentration of 0.3125 * , as described in the Applied Biosystems Protocol for Creating Custom RT and Preamplification Pools using TaqMan MicroRNA Assays. One microlitre of the RT product was used in 10 mul pre-amplification reactions containing 0.5 * concentration ofmiR-141,miR-146b-3p,miR-194andmiR-375TaqMan MicroRNA assays, as described previously (SelthNone, 2011). The pre-amplification product was then diluted 10-fold in RNase-free water and 2 mul used in real-time PCRs containing 1 * concentrations of individual TaqMan MicroRNA assays and 5 mul of TaqMan Universal Master Mix, No AmpErase UNG (Applied Biosystems). Cel-miR-39was quantified by adding 2 mul of 10-fold diluted cDNA (not pre-amplified) in real-time PCRs as described above. Cq values of endogenous miRNAs were normalised tocel-miR-39Cq values, which ranged from 19.60 to 22.45 (mean 20.73, standard deviation 0.59). In 10 samples,miR-146b-3pwas not detected (Cq greater than 40); for statistical analyses, the Cq values for these samples were set to the maximum Cq across all samples (MadhavanNone, 2012). The efficiency and specificity of the assays were confirmed by using synthetic oligonucleotides (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) corresponding to mature miRNAsmiR-141,miR-146b-3p,miR-194,miR-375andcel-miR-39(sequences obtained from miRBase, release 19). Single oligonucleotide (1 fmol) or an oligonucleotide pool (1 fmol of each) was added to single plex (i.e., containing single miRNA stem-loop RT primers) or multiplexed (i.e., containing all five miRNA stem-loop RT primers) RT reactions. Reverse transcription products were diluted over four orders of magnitude; the serial dilutions were used in qPCRs containing single Taqman assays to generate standard curves and to determine efficiency values for each assay. Two microlitres of each RT product (1 : 10 000 diluted) was also used as template in either single plex or multiplexed pre-amplification reactions. Pre-amplified cDNA was diluted over four orders of magnitude and used to generate standard curves and to define qPCR efficiency. Finally, assay specificity was assessed by determining the relative detection of the assay-specific synthetic miRNAvsthe four non-specific synthetic miRNAs in qPCRs following multiplexed RT/pre-amplification. Cross-reactivity values were calculated based on the Cq difference between assay-specific and non-specific synthetic miRNAs and expressed as percent relative detection. Serum miRNA markers of prostate cancer recurrence were analysed in two tumour data sets (TaylorNone, 2010;Martens-UzunovaNone, 2011). The Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center data set contains miRNA expression data from 99 primary prostate cancers, 28 non-malignant tissues and 14 metastases. The Erasmus Medical Center data set contains miRNA expression data from 50 primary tumours obtained by RP, 22 primary tumours obtained by Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP), 12 lymph-node metastases and 15 normal prostate tissues. Both tissue cohorts were profiled using Agilent microRNA V2 arrays. Raw data were downloaded from GEO (accession number GSE21036) and ArrayExpress (accession number E-TABM-794) and processed using AgiMicroRNA (Lopez-Romero, 2011). Clinical data for the Erasmus Medical Center cohort were kindly provided by Drs E Martens-Uzunova and G Jenster. Biochemical recurrence-free survival was measured from the date of RP to relapse or the date of last follow-up. Differences in serum miRNA levels between the BCR and progression-free groups, as defined by TLDA profiling, were assessed usingttests. The association between serum miRNA levels and BCR in the validation cohort was assessed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression. The capacity of serum miRNAs to distinguish between men who experienced recurrence and men who remained disease free was evaluated by ROC curve analysis. Predicted values from logistic regression models were used to generate ROC curves from a combination of variables (i.e., serum miRNAs plus clinical variables). Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA tests were employed to compare miRNA levels among normal prostate tissue, primary tumours and metastatic samples. All statistical analyses were done using GraphPad Prism (version 5; GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA) and MedCalc (version 12; MedCalc Software, Mariakerke, Belgium). Serum samples from 16 patients (Table 1) representing two disparate groups - men who experienced rapid BCR following RP and men with a mean of 53.4 months follow-up post-RP but no evidence of BCR - were profiled using TLDAs. The two groups were otherwise closely matched in terms of clinicopathological parameters such as Gleason score, primary Gleason grade and staging to increase the likelihood of identifying miRNAs that may complement existing prognostic tools. All samples were collected from patients treated at RAH, South Australia. One sample from the BCR group was disregarded following TLDA profiling because the clinical follow-up data could not be verified. After data filtering and normalisation (see Materials and methods), 217 miRNAs were detectable in circulation (Figure 1A). Of these, onlymiR-141,miR-146b-3pandmiR-194were differentially expressed between the BCR and no BCR groups (P less than 0.05, no adjustment for multiple testing) (Figure 1B). MiR-141has been identified as a marker of high-risk and metastatic prostate cancer in previous studies (MitchellNone, 2008;BraseNone, 2011;SelthNone, 2011;BryantNone, 2012), suggesting that the TLDA data were robust and our experimental approach was well founded. Other miRNAs previously associated with high-risk and metastatic disease, includingmiR-375andmiR-200b(BraseNone, 2011;SelthNone, 2011;BryantNone, 2012), were elevated in men who relapsed but the differences were not statistically significant (Figure 1C). Recent reports suggest that peripheral blood cells can be a major source of circulating miRNAs (PritchardNone, 2012). In the absence of blood cell counts or haemoglobin concentrations for our samples, we investigated the levels of miRNAs known to be highly expressed in white (WBC) and red (RBC) blood cells:miR-150andmiR-223are markers of lymphoid and myeloid WBCs, respectively (PritchardNone, 2012), while bothmiR-16andmiR-451are present at high concentrations in RBCs and can be used to assess haemolysis during serum preparation (KirschnerNone, 2011). The Cq values for these miRNAs are shown inFigure 2A. The expression level and variation in range of Cq values for the individual miRNAs (miR-150, 2.4;miR-223, 2.6;miR-16, 3.2;miR-451, 4.4) was comparable to that observed in previous studies (KirschnerNone, 2011;PritchardNone, 2012), suggesting that the levels of miRNAs determined by TLDA qRT-PCR were unlikely to be significantly impacted by contaminating cellular miRNAs. Furthermore, none of the cellular miRNAs were differentially expressed between the BCR and no BCR groups (Figure 2B). To validate the findings from the screening study, we collected a larger, independent set of patient samples from a different site (SVH, New South Wales) to those analysed in the screening study. This validation cohort was comprised of 70 patients and enriched for men who had experienced early BCR following the RP (n=31;Table 2). For men who progressed, the median time from RP to recurrence was 24.7 months. All of the cancers had a Gleason score of 7 (3+4 or 4+3); as such, the patients represent an intermediate risk group that would benefit from additional markers of disease behaviour (D'AmicoNone, 1998). The three miRNAs found to be significantly elevated in patients who subsequently relapsed in the screening study (miR-141,miR-146b-3pandmiR-194) were quantitated in serum samples from these patients using qRT-PCR. We also measuredmiR-375, since it has been previously correlated with adverse risk factors and it was elevated in the BCR group, albeit non-significantly, in our screening study. Levels of the candidate BCR-associated miRNAs were normalised to spiked-incel-miR-39only, since there is no consensus on suitable endogenous small RNAs in circulation for such a purpose (KrohNone, 2010). Before quantitation of circulating miRNAs in the validation cohort, we assessed whether multiplexing the RT and pre-amplification reactions affected the efficiency and/or specificity of themiR-141,miR-146b-3p,miR-194,miR-375andcel-miR-39assays. All of the assays performed similarly when used in combination (multiplexed) or individually (Figure 3A). Moreover, qPCR efficiency values of the assays following multiplexed RT/pre-amplification ranged from 93.8% to 104.1%, within the commonly employed functional cutoff of 90-110% (Figure 3A). To evaluate the specificity of the assays, we utilised synthetic mature miRNA molecules as templates in multiplexed RT/pre-amplification reactions followed by qPCR with individual assays. Only themiR-141andmiR-146b-3passays exhibited any detectable cross-reactivity, but relative detection of the non-specific miRNA was 4-5 orders of magnitude less than the specific miRNA (Figure 3B). Collectively, these results indicated that quantitation of circulatingmiR-141,miR-146b-3p,miR-194andmiR-375using a multiplexed Taqman assay was a robust approach. Kaplan-Meier (KM) analysis was used to test for an association between the circulating miRNAs and BCR. For each miRNA, patients were dichotomised into two groups based on median levels. Higher circulating levels ofmiR-146b-3pandmiR-194were associated with an increased risk of BCR butmiR-141andmiR-375were not (Figure 4). The prognostic capacity of the circulating miRNAs was further assessed using Cox proportional hazard regression. Univariate analysis demonstrated that high circulating levels ofmiR-146b-3pwere associated with a reduced recurrence-free interval, as was pre-operative serum PSA concentration, Gleason grade and seminal vesicle invasion (SVI) (Table 3). A combined value representing the mean normalised Cq ofmiR-146b-3pandmiR-194possessed greater prognostic value (P=0.004, hazard ratio=1.29 (95% confidence interval (CI)=1.07-1.57)). In multivariate analysis,miR-146b-3p, pre-operative PSA and SVI were significant predictors of time to BCR (Table 3), indicating that this circulating miRNA provides prognostic information independent of standard clinicopathological parameters. The capacity of circulatingmiR-146b-3pandmiR-194to distinguish between men who subsequently recurred and men who remained disease free was further evaluated by ROC curve analysis. CirculatingmiR-146b-3p(area under the curve (AUC)=0.62,P=0.095),miR-194(AUC=0.65,P=0.029), pre-operative PSA (AUC=0.69,P=0.003) and SVI (AUC=0.60,P=0.013) all possessed similar discriminatory power. Adding the miRNA variables to SVI significantly improved its discriminatory power (AUC of SVI+miRNAs=0.75; SVI alone=0.60;P-value of difference=0.007), whereas the AUC of PSA combined with the miRNAs was only marginally increased compared with PSA alone (PSA+miRNAs=0.74; PSA alone=0.69;P=0.297) (Figure 5). We also evaluated the correlation between circulating miRNAs and clinicopathological factors (Table 4). NeithermiR-146b-3pnormiR-194was associated with primary Gleason grade, pathologic stage or SVI. IncreasedmiR-194was positively correlated with age, butmiR-146b-3pwas not. Interestingly,miR-146b-3pwas negatively correlated with margin status. Both miRNAs showed a trend towards positive correlation with pre-operative serum PSA levels, but this did not reach statistical significance. Given their association with outcome, we hypothesised that circulatingmiR-146b-3pandmiR-194were derived from cancer cells. As a preliminary effort to test this hypothesis, the expression of these miRNAs was evaluated in tumour samples. Two clinical cohorts were evaluated, one from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC cohort) and the other from the Erasmus Medical Center (Erasmus cohort). In both of the cohorts,miR-146b-3pexpression in normal and malignant tissues was very low (not detectable in 38 out of 99 (Erasmus) and 80 out of 141 (MSKCC) samples), precluding further analysis. By contrast,miR-194was robustly expressed in normal and malignant prostate cells and was found to be significantly higher in both lymph-node metastases (Erasmus) and a mixed population of metastases (MSKCC) (Figure 6A). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that highmiR-194was a poor prognostic indicator in the Erasmus cohort, but this association did not reach statistical significance (Figure 6B, left). When the MSKCC cohort was dichotomised by the medianmiR-194expression, no association with BCR was observed (data not shown). However, the highest quartile ofmiR-194in the MSKCC cohort had a significantly poorer prognosis than the lower quartile (Figure 6B, right). Univariate Cox proportional hazard regression revealed that highmiR-194was significantly correlated with time to BCR in the MSKCC cohort (P=0.033, hazard ratio=3.33 (95% CI=1.12-9.87)) and with time to metastasis in the Erasmus cohort (P=0.026, hazard ratio=3.75 (95% CI=1.28-10.97)). Biomarkers that provide accurate prognostic information for men with prostate cancer are urgently required. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that circulatingmiR-146b-3pandmiR-194, measured immediately before RP, can be used to predict disease progression in patients of intermediate risk. This finding was achieved by employing a set of samples with comprehensive long-term clinical outcome data. In addition, circulatingmiR-146b-3pandmiR-194were only weakly correlated with other clinical variables, suggesting that they provide new prognostic information. Therefore, these markers have the potential to improve the management of intermediate risk localised prostate cancers, which would be of significant clinical utility. WhilemiR-146b-3phas not been directly linked to prostate cancer, there is accumulating evidence for a role of themiR-146family in this malignancy. In an early miRNA profiling study,miR-146a-5pwas shown to be commonly overexpressed in solid tumours, including prostate cancer (VoliniaNone, 2006). More recently, it was reported that the expression of bothmiR-146a-5pandmiR-146b-5pwas reduced in a cell line model of castration-resistant prostate cancer compared with androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells (LinNone, 2008) andmiR-146b-5pwas decreased in metastaticvsnon-metastatic xenografts (WatahikiNone, 2011). How the loss ofmiR-146during prostate cancer progression fits with our observation that serummiR-146b-3pis a marker of disease recurrence is currently unclear. Interestingly, the 5p and 3p forms ofmiR-146bhave converse associations with recurrence of non-small cell lung cancer (PatnaikNone, 2009,2011), providing a precedent for distinct functions of themiR-146bpairs in cancer progression. Despite its association with disease behaviour,miR-146b-3pdoes not appear to be expressed at high levels in normal or malignant prostate tissue. We envision at least three explanations for this apparent discrepancy. First,miR-146b-3pcould be efficiently released from cancer cells into circulation such that it does not accumulate in the tumour. Preferential cellular export of certain miRNAs has been reported previously (for review, seeSelthNone, 2012). Indeed,miR-1andmiR-133aare increased in serum in response to acute myocardial infarction but the levels of both are reduced in the infarcted myocardial tissue (KuwabaraNone, 2011), indicating that large discrepancies between the levels of miRNA in circulation compared with their tissue of origin are possible. Second, serummiR-146b-3pmay originate from circulating tumour cells (CTCs) and/or micrometastases that have not been detected at the time of treatment. Given its association with disease recurrence, we favour this explanation. Finally, we cannot rule out the possibility that circulatingmiR-146b-3pdoes not originate from malignant prostate cells but rather from systemic changes in response to the disease, such as inflammatory responses. In support of our discovery that circulatingmiR-194is associated with disease progression,TongNone(2009)reported that this miRNA was elevated in tumours from men who experienced rapid BCR (within 2 years of RP) compared with men who did not experience BCR?10 years after surgery. Our analysis of two large, published data sets further demonstrated that the intra-tumoural expression ofmiR-194was associated with poor outcome measures, including BCR and metastasis, although further analysis in larger cohorts is required to make more definitive conclusions. Collectively, these observations suggest thatmiR-194may be expressed in high-risk tumours and released into circulation during carcinogenesis. Interestingly,miR-194was recently found to be elevated in the serum of a mouse model of diffuse-type gastric cancer, suggesting that it may be a more general circulating marker of malignancy (RotkruaNone, 2013). Of all the circulating miRNAs previously associated with prostate cancer,miR-141andmiR-375have been the most commonly identified (MitchellNone, 2008;BraseNone, 2011;GonzalesNone, 2011;SelthNone, 2011;BryantNone, 2012;NguyenNone, 2012). These earlier studies demonstrated associations betweenmiR-141/miR-375and clinicopathological parameters (Gleason score, pathologic stage and lymph-node status), metastatic disease and treatment response. However, while both of these miRNAs were elevated in men who experienced BCR in the screening cohort (note that formiR-375, this was a non-significant change), neither were correlated with BCR in the larger validation cohort. Therefore, the potential of these circulating miRNAs as clinically useful markers for prostate cancer remains to be conclusively proven. With this in mind, it is worth noting that studies of circulating miRNAs to date are highlighted by conflicting data and outcomes, which likely arise from heterogeneity in terms of objectives and methodology. Improving the consistency and standardisation of these factors is of critical importance for future work. A role in epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity is an emerging link between many of the circulating miRNAs associated with prostate cancer. MiR-141andmiR-200bare members of themiR-200family, which target the Zeb1/2 transcription factors and thereby repress epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (BrackenNone, 2009). MiR-429is anothermiR-200family member that was significantly elevated in the BCR group of our screening cohort, although it was filtered from further analysis because of low expression (average Cq=41.3 in the screening samples). MiR-194can also inhibit EMT in models of liver (MengNone, 2010) and endometrial cancer (DongNone, 2011) and may directly target the mesenchymal factor N-cadherin (SongNone, 2011). Additionally, a recent study found thatmiR-375could partially reverse EMT in MCF-7 breast cancer cells (WardNone, 2012). It is currently unclear why these 'epithelial' miRNAs are elevated in the circulation of men with metastatic prostate cancer (i.e.,miR-141,miR-200bandmiR-375;MitchellNone, 2008;BraseNone, 2011;SelthNone, 2011;BryantNone, 2012) or localised prostate cancer with a poor prognosis (miR-194, this study). One possibility is that they are indicative of CTCs and/or metastases that have undergone or are undergoing a mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET), a process likely to be important for efficient metastatic colonisation (GaoNone, 2012). Supporting this concept,MadhavanNone(2012)recently demonstrated that circulatingmiR-200family members andmiR-375are surrogate markers for CTCs in breast cancer and correlated with disease progression and overall survival. The circulating levels ofmiR-200family members have also been associated with a poor outcome in gastric and endometrial cancer (Valladares-AyerbesNone, 2012;TorresNone, 2013). Collectively, these findings suggest that disruption of MET to prevent metastatic colonisation may be an effective therapeutic strategy. Even with a pre-amplification step, some serum prostate cancer-associated miRNAs reported previously and in this study (e.g.,miR-141andmiR-146b-3p) are at the limit of detection by Taqman qRT-PCR. Moreover, others that are potentially useful markers of BCR (e.g.,miR-429) were discarded from our analyses because of low concentration. We believe that emerging technologies, such as NanoString, digital PCR and miRNA-specific nanopores (WangNone, 2011), will increase the accuracy of miRNA detection from cell-free fractions of body fluids and thereby enhance the utility of these molecules as disease-specific markers. A limitation of this study is the validation cohort, which was small, limited to Gleason score 7 patients, and enriched for men who experienced early biochemical disease progression. Moreover, although BCR has become thede factomeasure of the effectiveness of RP (Nielsen and Partin, 2007), it does not always translate into clinical progression. Indeed, there have been conflicting reports regarding the utility of BCR as a predictor of metastasis and cancer-specific survival (AgarwalNone, 2008;BoorjianNone, 2011). As such, the results should be interpreted with caution and with the caveat that additional studies might uncover circulating miRNAs that add to or outperform the markers identified here, particularly in relation to prognosing systemic progression and/or prostate cancer death. Despite these limitations, it is worth reinforcing the potential utility of circulating miRNAs such asmiR-146b-3pandmiR-194that may assist in prognosis of intermediate risk patients, a group that engenders considerable clinical uncertainty. We intend to validate our findings in a larger, prospectively collected cohort of such patients and assess whether these miRNAs add to pre-operative nomograms and thereby have the potential to reduce rates of overtreatment. In this respect, it is important to note that whereas pre-operative clinical parameters, such as Gleason score, can be affected by undersampling (HaasNone, 2007) and/or molecular heterogeneity of multifocal disease (BarryNone, 2007), circulating miRNAs are likely to provide an overall snapshot of changes occurring in response to tumour growth. Moreover, circulating miRNAs can be measured non-invasively and repeatedly, which may assist in treatment decision-making. We also believe that circulating miRNAs are likely to have potential as prognostic markers in men treated by active surveillance or in men with high-risk localised cancers, two further applications that will be assessed in future work.
