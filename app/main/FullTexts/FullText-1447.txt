The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial and Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications study have demonstrated in adolescents and adults that intensive diabetes management significantly reduces the risk of vascular complications in type 1 diabetes (1,2) and that this benefit is sustained over time (3). In addition to glucose control, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity (4-7) increase risk for future vascular disease, and these risk factors can be present in youth with type 1 diabetes. Both the American Diabetes Association (ADA) (8-10) and the International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD) (11) have established targets for HbA1c, blood pressure (BP), lipids, and BMI for youth with type 1 diabetes. The T1D Exchange clinic registry provides an opportunity to assess the frequencies of youth meeting these targets. The T1D Exchange Clinic Network includes 67 United States-based pediatric or adult endocrinology practices. A registry of individuals with type 1 diabetes commenced enrollment in September 2010 (12). Each clinic received approval from an institutional review board (IRB). Informed consent was obtained according to IRB requirements from adult participants and parents or guardians of minors, and assent was obtained from minors. This report includes 13,316 participants from 67 sites enrolled through 1 August 2012, who were younger than 20 years old at enrollment with type 1 diabetes for greater than 1 year. Data were collected for the registry's database from the participant's medical record and by having the participant or parent complete a comprehensive questionnaire (12). A recent HbA1cvalue (within 6 months before enrollment) was available for 99% (N= 13,226) of participants (82% obtained using DCA, 3% from another point-of-care device, 12% from a laboratory, 3% by an unrecorded method). Data for BP and BMI were available for 12,664 (95%) and 13,045 (98%) participants. Among the 12,639 participants age 6 years or older, fasting LDL, HDL, and fasting triglycerides were available for 2,928 (23%), 8,693 (69%), and 2,387 (19%) participants, respectively (lipid results are not reported for participants age 1 to younger than 6 years because of the small amount of data). Data were categorized according to the following ADA and ISPAD targets: HbA1cThe proportion of participants meeting ISPAD and ADA targets for HbA1c, BP, lipids, and BMI were tabulated according to age group. Differences in the characteristics of participants meeting HbA1ctargets were evaluated through logistic regression models adjusted for potential confounders. In view of the large sample size, onlyP less than 0.01 was considered statistically significant. Among the 13,316 pediatric participants, 677 (5%) were 1 to younger than 6 years of age, 5,336 (40%) were 6 to younger than 13 years of age, and 7,303 (55%) were 13 to younger than 20 years of age (mean age, 12.7 years; mean diabetes duration, 5.6 years; 48% female; 78% non-Hispanic white). An insulin pump was used by 55% of participants and a continuous glucose monitor was used by 3%. The median (25th and 75th percentile) number of self-reported self-monitoring of blood glucose per day was 5 (4,7). The ISPAD and ADA targets for HbA1c, BP, BMI, and lipids are shown according to age inFig. 1. Mean +/- SD for HbA1cwas 8.2 +/- 1.1% in those 1 to younger than 6 years old, 8.3 +/- 1.2% in those 6 to younger than 13 years old, and 8.8 +/-1.7% in those 13 to younger than 20 years old. The age-specific ADA HbA1ctarget was met by 32% of participants and the ISPAD HbA1ctarget of less than =7.5% was met by 25% of participants. The percentage meeting ADA and ISPAD HbA1ctargets was higher in the younger age groups compared with the group 13 to younger than 20 years old (P less than 0.001 for ADA and ISPAD). Among pump users 1 to younger than 6 years old, the proportions of participants meeting the ADA and ISPAD HbA1ctargets were 79 and 37% compared with 50 and 17% among injection users (P less than 0.001, adjusted for diabetes duration, race/ethnicity, household income, insurance, and self-monitoring of blood glucose per day). In those 6 to younger than 13 years old, 50 and 32% of insulin pump users met the ADA and ISPAD HbA1ctargets compared with 34 and 20% of injection users (P less than 0.001). There was not a significant difference in the percentage meeting HbA1ctargets between insulin pump users and injection users among the group 13 to younger than 20 years old (24 and 27% of pump users vs. 18 and 20% of injection users;P= 0.11 and 0.02). Only 14% of non-Hispanic black participants met the ADA HbA1ctarget compared with 34 and 28% in non-Hispanic white and Hispanic participants (adjustedP less than 0.001). Among participants with available data, 95 and 86% met ADA and ISPAD HDL targets; 78, 63, 65, and 90% met BP, BMI, LDL, and triglycerides targets. A: Proportion of participants meeting HbA1ctargets (N= 13,226). ADA (black bars): less than 8.5% for those 1 to younger than 6 years of age, less than 8.0% for those 6 to younger than 13 years of age, and less than 7.5% for those 13 to younger than 20 years of age. ISPAD (striped bars): less than 7.5%. B: Proportion of participants meeting BP target (N= 12,664) less than 90th percentile for age, sex, and height. C: Proportion of participants meeting BMI target (N= 13,045) less than 85th percentile for age and sex. BMI percentile was not calculated for those younger than 2 years of age. D: Proportion of participants meeting fasting LDL target (N= 3,010) less than 100 mg/dL ( less than 2.6 mmol/L). E: Proportion of participants meeting HDL target (N= 8,938). ADA (black bars): greater than 35 mg/dL; ISPAD (striped bars): greater than 1.1 mmol/L. F: Proportion of participants meeting triglycerides target (N= 2,454) less than 150 mg/dL ( less than 1.7 mmol/L). These data from the T1D Exchange describe how frequently ADA and ISPAD targets are met in the largest reported sample (N= 13,316) of youth with type 1 diabetes in the United States. Only approximately one-third of participants met the age-specific ADA and ISPAD targets for HbA1c. Although the majority of participants did meet BP, lipid, and BMI targets, the frequency of abnormalities for these vascular disease risk factors is concerning (13). Because the clinic registry is not a population-based study, these results may not be representative of all youth with type 1 diabetes. However, participant characteristics were similar to those of patients not enrolled into the registry at the 67 clinics and when compared with the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Study (12). Comparisons with DPV German registry are difficult because of differences in target definitions (14). Another limitation is the number of participants missing fasting lipid results and with HbA1cresults obtained from point of care. Despite advances in technologies and strategies for care, achieving HbA1ctargets remains a significant challenge for the majority of youth in the T1D Exchange registry. Moreover, a large number of youth with diabetes already have additional vascular disease risk factors at a young age. This analysis suggests further transformations to improve pediatric diabetes care are needed to prevent future complications of diabetes.
