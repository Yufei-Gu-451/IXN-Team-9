Ubiquitination is an important post-translational modification that regulates protein function in eukaryotic cells. The covalent attachment of ubiquitin to selected targets has a range of consequences including changes in protein activity, localization, and stability (Vierstra, 2009). The outcome of protein ubiquitination is determined by the number of ubiquitin molecules and by the topology of the polyubiquitin chain that is attached to the substrate. For example, the attachment of a polyubiquitin chain generated using lysine-48 linkages generally serves as a signal for degradation of the modified protein by the 26S proteasome, a multi-subunit protease (Vierstra, 2009). By controlling the abundance of regulatory proteins such as transcription factors, the ubiquitin-proteasome system enables organisms to control their cellular milieu to transition through developmental stages and respond to changes in the environment. The covalent attachment of ubiquitin to targets involves the sequential action of three enzymes. First, E1 (ubiquitin-activating enzyme) activates ubiquitin in an ATP-dependent reaction. E2 (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme) then accepts the activated ubiquitin, forming a thioester linked E2-ubiquitin (E2-Ub) intermediate. The substrate-recruiting E3 (ubiquitin ligase) facilitates the transfer of ubiquitin from the E2-Ub intermediate onto the target. Ubiquitin ligases are categorized based on the type of domain used to recruit the E2-Ub intermediate. The largest category of E3s uses the Really Interesting New Gene (RING) domain to bind to E2-Ub. The RING domain consists of an octet of zinc-coordinating cysteine and histidine residues that form a cross-brace structure that is essential for ubiquitin transfer (LorickNone, 1999). The RING domain is found in both monomeric and multi-subunit E3 ligases. Monomeric RING-type E3s contain both the E2 and substrate-binding domains within a single polypeptide, whereas multi-subunit or CULLIN (CUL)-based E3 ligases use different subunits for E2 and substrate-binding functions. Monomeric RING-type E3 ligases can be further subcategorized based on the presence of predicted substrate-binding domains (StoneNone, 2005). Keep on Going (KEG) is a monomeric RING-type E3 ligase that is part of the seven-member Ankyrin repeat domain-containing subgroup (StoneNone, 2005,2006). KEG is a unique member of this subgroup because, in addition to the RING domain and Ankyrin repeats, the protein also contains a kinase domain and a series of HERC2-like repeats. The HERC2-like repeats are involved in protein interactions and may mediate the dimerization of KEG (Gu and Innes, 2011).There are no other proteins in the predictedArabidopsisproteome with a domain organization similar to KEG. However, homologues of KEG are found in other plant genomes includingOryza sativa,Medicago truncatulaandPopulus tricocarpa(StoneNone, 2006). KEG negatively regulates abscisic acid (ABA) signalling by targeting the ABA-responsive bZIP transcription factor Abscisic Acid Insensitive 5 (ABI5) for degradation by the 26S proteasome (StoneNone, 2006;Liu and Stone, 2010). ABA functions during adaptive responses to environmental stress and also plays a pivotal role as a growth regulator during normal development (HimmelbachNone, 2003). After germination, seedlings sense their nutritional and environmental conditions and modify their growth to ensure survival. At this developmental checkpoint, ABA promotes the accumulation and activation of ABI5 to suspend seedling growth until conditions improve (Lopez-MolinaNone, 2001,2003). Multiple lines of evidence support the requirement for KEG in maintaining low levels of ABI5 in the absence of ABA. KEGmutants accumulate extremely high levels of ABI5,keg-1seedlings display a severe post-germinative growth-arrest phenotype that can be partially rescued by loss ofABI5, KEG interacts with and ubiquitinates ABI5in vitro, and a functional KEG E3 ligase is required to rescue thekeg-1growth-arrest phenotype and return ABI5 levels to those of the wild type (StoneNone, 2006;Liu and Stone, 2010). ABA promotes KEG self-ubiquitination and degradation by the 26S proteasome (Liu and Stone, 2010). In combination with other factors, this reduction in KEG levels allows the accumulation of ABI5 and the subsequent ABA-mediated changes in gene expression required for growth arrest. TransgenicArabidopsisseedlings that overexpress ABI5 do not undergo post-germinative growth arrest, which suggests that the accumulation of ABI5 only partially accounts for the severity of thekegphenotype. keg-1 abi5-1seedlings have normal and expanded cotyledons but fail to develop beyond the seedling stage (StoneNone, 2006). Therefore,KEGhas a greater influence on plant development than the regulation of ABI5 abundance. In order to understand the essential role KEG plays during development, we used a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify KEG-interacting proteins. Calcineurin B-like Interacting Protein Kinase (CIPK) 26 was isolated as a KEG-interacting protein. InArabidopsis, there are 26 members of the CIPK family (Weinl and Kudla, 2009) which are also referred to as sucrose non-fermenting-1 (SNF1)-related protein kinase 3 (SnRK3) (HrabakNone, 2003). The CIPK family is defined by the presence of an N-terminal Ser/Thr kinase domain with homology to sucrose non-fermenting-1 kinase (SNF) from yeast and AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK) from animals, a NAF domain and a protein phosphatase interaction (PPI) domain (OhtaNone, 2003;Weinl and Kudla, 2009) (Fig. 1A). The NAF domain acts as an autoinhibitory module and binding of Ca2+sensing calcineurin B-like (CBL) proteins to the NAF domain is thought to relieve inhibition (GuoNone, 2001;GongNone, 2002None). In addition to relieving autoinhibition, CBL proteins also direct the cellular localization of CIPK proteins (BatisticNone, 2010). Genetic loss-of-function and gain-of-function analyses have revealed that CIPKs can also modulate ABA responses (GongNone, 2002None;KimNone, 2003;PandeyNone, 2008). CIPK26 interacts with KEGin vitro. (A) Schematic representation of KEG and CIPK26 deletion constructs used in yeast two-hybrid screens and GST pull-down assays. A schematic of the partial segment of CIPK26 identified via the yeast two-hybrid screen is also indicated. (B) Interaction between BD-RAAKA and AD-CIPK26133-403indicated by beta-galactosidase activity of soluble extracts prepared from yeast colonies. beta-Galactosidase assays were done in triplicate. Results are shown as means +/-standard error. beta-Galactosidase activity from yeast transformed with BD-RAAKA and AD-CIPK26133-403constructs was significantly different from all other combinations (*,P less than 0.05). Statistical analysis was performed using Student'st-test. (C) GST pull-down assays using bead-bound GST, GST-RK, GST-A or GST-H and bacterial cell lysates containing His-Flag-CIPK26N or His-Flag-CIPK26C. GST-RK was able to pull down His-Flag-CIPK26N (upper left panel) and not His-Flag-CIPK26C (upper right panel) as detected by Western blot (WB) analysis with Flag antibodies. Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) staining was used to visualize GST and the GST fusion proteins used in each assay (bottom panels; * indicates the relevant band). The blots shown are representative of two independent trials. Here we demonstrate that CIPK26 interacts with KEG, which targets the kinase for ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation. Overexpression ofCIPK26renders transgenic plants hypersensitive to ABA. Consistent with this observation, CIPK26 interacts with ABI1 and ABI2, two negative regulators of ABA signalling. In addition, CIPK26 interacts with ABI5 and is capable of phosphorylating ABI5in vitro. These results suggest that CIPK26 plays a role during ABA signal transduction and that KEG targets CIPK26 for degradation. Arabidopsis thalianaecotype Columbia-0 (Col-0) was grown as described byLiu and Stone (2010). Nicotiana benthamiana(tobacco) plants were grown under a photoperiod of 8h of light and 16h of dark at 23 degrees C.The previously describedkeg-1(Salk_049542) obtained from the Callis laboratory (University of California, Davis, CA, USA) was originally from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC) (AlonsoNone, 2003;StoneNone, 2006). cipk26-1(Salk_005859) andcipk26-2(Salk_074944) were obtained from ABRC. Seedlings were genotyped using PCR. For reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, RNA was isolated from 8-d-old seedlings using TRIzol reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All primers used in this study are listed inSupplementary Table S1atJXBonline. Unless specified, all cloning was done using Gateway cloning technology (Invitrogen). CIPK26cDNA and segments were generated by RT-PCR (see above). A Phusion site-directed mutagenesis kit (Finnzymes) was used to introduce mutations into CIPK26N cDNA to generate CIPK26NTDand CIPK26NKR(GongNone, 2002None,None). The cloning of full-lengthABI5and wild-type and RING mutant versions ofKEGcDNAs were as described previously (Liu and Stone, 2010). ABI1andABI2cDNAs were obtained from ABRC. A 17-beta-estradiol-inducibleKEGexpression vector was generated from the activator/responder vector pLB12 (BrandNone, 2006) and pEarleyGate 201 (EarleyNone, 2006). In brief, the 35S promoter was introduced in pLB12 upstream of the chimaeric transcription factor XVE. Using theXho? restriction sites, pLB12 was digested and then ligated with pEarlyGate201 lacking the 35S promoter. KEGcDNA was then introduced into the resulting vector to create35S:XVE/OlexA:HA-KEGreferred to in this report asOlexA:HA-KEG. In this vector, there is constitutive expression of XVE, and addition of 17-beta-estradiol stimulates expression ofKEGfrom theOlexApromoter. All nucleotide sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing (Genome Quebec Innovation Centre, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada). The yeast two-hybrid Gateway destination vectors (pNLexAattR and pJZ4attR) and reporter (pJK103) were gifts from the Finley laboratory (Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA) and the screen protocol was as described bySerebriiskiiNone(2001). A cDNA library (prey) made fromArabidopsissiliques, flower buds, and germinating seeds (Norclone Biotech Laboratories) was a gift from the Gazzarrini laboratory (University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada). Using the RING, kinase, and Ankyrin portion of KEG as bait, approximately 350 yeast colonies were selected for by growth on medium lacking leucine. Positive clones were then selected for by streaking yeast colonies onto medium containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl-beta-None-galactopyranoside (BioShop Canada). Purified plasmids were then sequenced (Genome Quebec). One isolated clone representedCIPK26and interaction was verified by a beta-galactosidase activity liquid assay (Clontech Yeast Protocols Handbook). To generate35S:GFP-CIPK26transgenic plants, the full-lengthCIPK26cDNA was introduced into the pMDC43 Gateway plant transformation vector (Curtis and Grossniklaus, 2003). The resulting plasmid was then transformed intoAgrobacterium tumefaciensstrain GV3101. The floral dip method (Clough and Bent, 1998) was used to introduce the transgene into Col-0. T1 transgenic plants were selected for by antibiotic resistance, and expression of the transgene was confirmed by Western blot (see below). To generate35S:GFP-CIPK26 OlexA:HA-KEGdouble-transgenic plants,35S:GFP-CIPK26(line 1) was transformed withOlexA:HA-KEGas described above. T1 transgenic plants were selected for by antibiotic resistance, and expression of the transgene was confirmed by Western blot (see below). Protein extracts from 6-d-old35S:GFP-CIPK26seedlings were subject to Western blot analysis with green fluorescent protein (GFP) antibodies. To assess the expression of HA-KEG, 4-d-old35S:GFP-CIPK26 OlexA:HA-KEGseedlings were grown in liquid medium and treated overnight with ethanol (control, solvent) or with 20 uM 17-beta-estradiol (Sigma). Protein extracts were subjected to Western blot analysis with haemagglutinin (HA) antibodies. For MG132 treatments, 6-d-old35S:GFP-CIPK26seedlings were treated for 16h with or without the proteasome inhibitors 50 uM Z-Leu-Leu-Leu-CHO (MG132), and 50 uMN-[(phenylmethoxy)carbonyl]-l-isoleucyl-l-alpha-glutamyl-tert-butyl ester-N-[(1S)-1-formyl-3-methylbutyl]-l-alaninamide (PSI; Boston Biochem). GFP-trap beads (20 ul; Chromotek) were used according to the manufacturer's instructions to immunoprecipitate GFP-CIPK26 from protein extracts (approximately 300 ul at 5 ug ul-1) prepared from35S:GFP-CIPK26seedlings treated for 16h with or without 50 uM MG132 and 50 uM PSI. Isolated proteins were then subjected to Western blot analysis with GFP or ubiquitin antibodies as described previously (Liu and Stone, 2010). For cell-free degradation assays,CIPK26Nwas introduced via Gateway cloning into the modified pDEST527 destination vector (Liu and Stone, 2010). Recombinant proteins were expressed inEscherichia colistrain Rosetta (DE3) and purified using nickel-charged resin (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Cell-free degradation assays were carried out as described byWangNone(2009). To examine degradation of GFP-CIPK26in planta, an assay described byJooNone(2008) was used. To demonstrate the effect that KEG has on GFP-CIPK26 protein abundancein planta, 4-d-old35S:GFP-CIPK26 OlexA:HA-KEGseedlings were grown for 24h in liquid medium and then treated overnight with ethanol (solvent, control) or with 20 uM 17-beta-estradiol. Seedlings were then treated with 1mM cycloheximide (CHX), and tissue was collected at the indicated time points and protein extracted for Western blot analysis as described above. Agrobacteriumtransformed with the appropriate binary plasmids was grown and prepared for transient expression as outlined previously (LiuNone, 2012). For localization ofCIPK26,CIPK26cDNA was introduced into the Gateway-compatible pEarleyGate101 plant transformation vector (EarleyNone, 2006). Gateway-compatible BiFC vectors pEarleyagte201-YN and pEarleygate202-YC were a gift from Dr Yuhai Cui's laboratory (Agriculture and Agri-Food London, ON, Canada;LuNone, 2010). CIPK26,KEG,ABI1,ABI2, andABI5cDNAs were recombined into the appropriate pEarlygate201-YN and pEarlygate202-YC vectors. Leaves were assayed for fluorescence 48h after infiltration for both subcellular localization and the BiFC assay. CIPK26N,CIPK26C, segments ofKEG(RK, A, and H; see Results),ABI1andABI2cDNAs were introduced into modified pDEST527 or pDEST565 (Liu and Stone, 2010). Pull-down assays were carried out as described previously (SchechtmanNone, 2003). Seeds were collected from plants of each genotype grown under the same conditions and harvested at the same time. Seeds were stratified at 4 degrees C in the dark for 3 d and then placed at 22 degrees C with continuous light for 36h. Germination was defined as radicle emergence through the seed coat. Assays were repeated three times with three replicates per trial and at least 30 seedlings per replicate. Various combinations of wild-type and mutated forms of nickel-purified His-Flag-CIPK26N and His-Flag-ABI5 were incubated at 30 degrees C for 30min in 30 ul kinase assay buffer (20mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 50mM NaCl, 1mM dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 10 uCi [gamma-33P]ATP). Addition of SDS-loading buffer and boiling for 5min stopped the reaction and samples were separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE. The gel was dried with a gel dryer and phosphorylated protein was detected by autoradiography. The in-gel kinase activity assay was preformed as described previously (LiuNone, 2008) with the following modifications: protein extract prepared from various genotypes treated with or without 50 uM ABA for 3h was separated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel embedded with 0.1mg ml-1of His-purified His-Flag-ABI5 protein in the separating gel as a substrate. Fluorescent images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM 510 META inverted confocal laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging) equipped with a 25* oil-immersion objective. Yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) fluorescence was detected at an excitation wavelength of 514nm, and emissions were collected between 530 and 600nm. For GFP fluorescence, an excitation wavelength of 488nm was used and emissions were collected between 475 and 525nm. To show the outline of each epidermal cell, a single slice of the fluorescent and bright-field images were overlaid. Yeast two-hybrid screens were performed to identify proteins that interact with KEG. Full-length KEG (RKAH) and portions of KEG [RING, kinase and Ankyrin region (RKA), Ankyrin repeats only (A), and Ankyrin and HERC2-like repeats (AH)] fused to the LexA DNA-binding domain (BD) were used as bait to screen anArabidopsiscDNA library generated from mRNA isolated from flowers, siliques, and germinating seeds (Fig. 1A). To prevent ubiquitination and degradation of interacting proteins, the RING domain of KEG was made non-functional by changing two essential zinc-coordinating cysteine residues to alanine (RAA) (StoneNone, 2006). A cDNA clone containing the partial open reading frame ofAT5G21326was found to restore growth on selection medium and repeatedly induced higher beta-galactosidase activity when co-expressed with BD-RAAKA relative to controls (Fig. 1A,B). The isolated cDNA encoded for a member of the CIPK/SnRK3 family named CIPK26. GST pull-down and BiFC assays were used to confirm the interaction between KEG and CIPK26. Segments of KEG fused to GST (GST-RK, GST-A and GST-H) were used in pull-down assays with 6*His- and Flag-tagged portions of CIPK26 (His-Flag-CIPK26N and His-Flag-CIPK26C) (Fig. 1A). Full-length CIPK26 is insoluble when expressed inE. colicells, which prohibited purification of sufficient protein for analysis. Under stringent isolation conditions, GST-RK was able to pull down His-Flag-CIPK26N, which contains the kinase domain of CIPK26 (Fig. 1C; top left panel), while GST-RK was not able to pull down His-Flag-CIPK26C (Fig. 1C; top right panel). The CIPK/SnRK3 proteins constitute a subfamily of the SnRKs, which also include SnRK1 and SnRK2 kinases. A protein sequence similarity tree was generated to establish the phylogenetic relationship between CIPK26 and other CIPK/SnRK3 family members (Supplementary Fig. S1atJXBonline). CIPK26 was most closely related to CIPK3, CIPK9, and CIPK23. Using microarray expression data available via Genevestigator(c),CIPK26was found to be widely expressed with its highest expression in seedlings (Supplementary Fig. S2atJXBonline). Similar to other CIPK family members (BatisticNone, 2010), CIPK26 was localized to the nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. 2A,B). YFP-tagged CIPK26 (CIPK26-YFP) was observed in the nucleus and cytoplasm ofNicotiana benthamiana(tobacco) epidermal cells transiently transformed viaAgrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation (Fig. 2A). A similar subcellular localization pattern was observed in stably transformedArabidopsisseedlings overexpressing GFP-tagged CIPK26 (GFP-CIPK26) (Fig. 2B). CIPK26 interacts with KEGin planta. (A) Localization of CIPK26-YFP in transiently transformedN. benthamianaepidermal cells. (B) Localization of CIPK26 in 4-d-old35S:GFP-CIPK26transgenicArabidopsisseedlings. (C) BiFC analysis inN. benthamianaleaf epidermal cells expressing full-length CIPK26 and KEG fused to the amino (YFPN) or carboxyl (YFPC) portions of YFP, respectively. Fluorescence indicates interaction between CIPK26-YFPNand KEG-YFPC. Left panels: fluorescent image from a single optical section; right panels: transmitted light images merged with fluorescence image from a single optical section. For BiFC analysis, tobacco leaf epidermal cells were transiently co-transformed with35S:CIPK26-YFPNoneand35S:KEG-YFPNoneto express CIPK26 fused to the amino-terminal portion of YFP (YFPN) and KEG fused to the carboxyl-terminal portion of YFP (YFPC). A strong fluorescence signal was observed in cells co-expressing CIPK26-YFPNand KEG-YFPC(Fig. 2C), which indicated reconstitution of the YFP protein as a result of interaction between CIPK26 and KEG. The fluorescent signal was observed throughout the cytoplasm, as well as in punctuate structures. These punctuate structures may represent thetrans-Golgi/early endosome vesicle localization of KEG, as described byGu and Innes (2011). Infiltration with35S:CIPK26-YFPNoneor35S:KEG-YFPNonealone did not result in a fluorescent signal (data not shown). The observation that KEG, a RING-type E3 ligase, interacts with CIPK26 suggests that CIPK26 protein levels may be regulated via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. A cell-free degradation assay was first used to determine whether CIPK26 is turned over and if degradation is proteasome dependent. His-Flag-CIPK26N was incubated with extracts prepared from wild-type seedlings supplemented with or without MG132, a specific inhibitor of the 26S proteasome (Fig. 3). In the absence of MG132, the levels of His-Flag-CIPK26N gradually decreased over time (Fig. 3, top panel). The degradation of His-Flag-CIPK26N was markedly slower in the presence of MG132, indicating that turnover of CIPK26 involved proteolysis by the 26S proteasome (Fig. 3, bottom panel). CIPK26 is turned over by the 26S proteasomein vitro. Cell-free degradation assay using recombinant His-Flag-CIPK26N. His-Flag-CIPK26N was incubated with protein extracts from 8-d-old Col-0 seedlings with (+) or without (-) 50 uM MG132. To facilitate further analysis of CIPK26, two independent35S:GFP-CIPK26transgenic lines were generated. Western blotting with GFP antibodies was used to verify the expression of the transgene. The GFP antibodies detected two proteins, one of approximately 80kDa, the expected size of GFP-CIPK26, and a larger migrating form (Fig. 4A, upper panels). These proteins were not detected in extracts prepared from wild-type and control (transformed with empty vector) plants (Fig. 4A, upper panels). To confirm that the detected proteins corresponded to GFP-CIPK26, GFP-trap beads were used in immunoprecipitation assays with extracts prepared from wild-type and35S:GFP-CIPK26(line 1) transgenic seedlings. Western blotting with GFP antibodies showed that the GFP-trap beads pulled down GFP-CIPK26 of increasing molecular weight (Fig. 4A, lower panel). These results suggested that CIPK26 is modifiedin plantaand this modification(s) resulted in a range of migrating species. To determine whether the high-molecular-weight forms of CIPK26 represented phosphorylated proteins, GFP-CIPK26 isolated using GFP-trap beads was simultaneously subjected to Western blot analysis with GFP antibodies (Supplementary Fig. S3A, left panel, atJXBonline) and phosphothreonine (P-Thr) antibodies (Supplementary Fig. S3A, right panel) that detected phosphorylated proteins. Comparison of the two blots showed that the P-Thr antibodies detected proteins corresponding to some of the higher-molecular-weight forms of GFP-CIPK26. CIPK26 is ubiquitinated and turned over by the 26S proteasomein planta. (A) Upper panel: protein expression levels of GFP-CIPK26 in two independently generated35S:GFP-CIPK26transgenic plant lines. Middle panel: ponceau S staining shows protein loading. Bottom panel: immunoprecipitation (IP) of GFP-CIPK26 from protein extracts prepared from Col-0 and35S:GFP-CIPK26(line 1) seedlings using GFP-trap beads. Multiple migrating higher-molecular-weight forms of GFP-CIPK26 were detected in extracts from35S:GFP-CIPK26(line 1). (B) Cell-free degradation assay using GFP-CIPK26. Protein extracts were prepared from 6-d-old35S:GFP-CIPK26(line 1) seedlings treated with (+) or without (-) 50 uM MG132. (C) CIPK26 protein accumulates in the presence of MG132.

GFP-trap immunoprecipitated (IP) GFP-CIPK26 from 4-d-old35S:GFP-CIPK26(line 1) seedlings treated with (+) or without (-) 50 uM MG132 and PSI were subject to WB analysis with ubiquitin (Ub) antibodies. High-molecular-weight smearing observed with ubiquitin antibodies after proteasome inhibitor treatment indicated ubiquitinated forms of GFP-CIPK26. (E) CHX treatment reduces the accumulation of CIPK26. Four-d-old35S:GFP-CIPK26(line 1) seedlings were treated with DMSO (lane 1), 1mM CHX (lane 2), 50 uM MG132 and 1mM CHX (lane 3) or 50 uM MG132 prior to addition of 1mM CHX (lane 4). All blots are representative of at least two trials. Ponceau S staining shows the protein loading. A modified cell-free degradation assay was used to monitor the turnover of full-length CIPK26 in protein extracts prepared from35S:GFP-CIPK26(lines 1 and 2) seedlings pre-treated with or without MG132. ATP, which is required for 26S proteasome activity, was added to plant extracts (zero time point) and the levels of GFP-CIPK26 were then determined at the indicated time points. The levels of GFP-CIPK26 gradually decreased over time for both transgenic plant lines (Fig. 4B, top panel;Supplemental Fig. 3B). The decrease in GFP-CIPK26 levels was significantly slower in protein extracts prepared from35S:GFP-CIPK26(line 1) seedlings pre-treated with MG132 (Fig. 4B, bottom panel). In addition, treatment of35S:GFP-CIPK26(line 1) seedlings with MG132 and another 26S proteasome inhibitor, PSI, repeatedly resulted in an increase in GFP-CIPK26 levels compared with levels in untreated seedlings (Fig. 4C). To determine whether CIPK26 is ubiquitinatedin planta, GFP-trap beads were used to isolate GFP-CIPK26 from protein extracts prepared from35S:GFP-CIPK26(line 1) seedlings treated with or without proteasome inhibitors. Ubiquitin antibodies detected a high-molecular-weight smear of GFP-CIPK26, indicative of ubiquitinated proteins, in extracts isolated from MG132- and PSI-treated seedlings (Fig. 4D). In35S:GFP-CIPK26transgenic plants, the 35S promoter continuously drives expression ofGFP-CIPK26and therefore GFP-CIPK26 protein is continuously replenished. If CIPK26 is indeed being degraded by the 26S proteasome, then inhibition of protein synthesis via treatment with CHX should result in a decrease in GFP-CIPK26, and treatment with MG132 should prevent this reduction in protein levels. As predicted, the levels of GFP-CIPK26 in transgenic seedlings treated overnight with CHX alone were significantly lower than those of mock (DMSO)-treated seedlings (Fig. 4E, compare lanes 1 and 2). The reduction in GFP-CIPK26 protein was not observed in seedlings treated with MG132 prior to and during incubation with CHX (Fig. 4E, lane 3). GFP-CIPK26 protein levels were also significantly reduced when MG132 was removed just prior to incubation of seedlings with CHX (Fig. 4E, lane 4). Together, the above results demonstrated that CIPK26 is ubiquitinated and turned over by the 26S proteasome. Double-transgenicArabidopsisplants constitutively expressingGFP-CIPK26(35S:GFP-CIPK26) andHA-KEG(OlexA:HA-KEG) under the control of an estradiol-inducible promoter were used to observe the stability of GFP-CIPK26 during a CHX chase experiment. Treatment of double- transgenic seedlings overnight with estradiol resulted in accumulation of HA-KEG (Fig. 5, top panel). CHX was added to the medium after estradiol treatment and the abundance of GFP-CIPK26 protein was monitored at various time points. Over time, the level of GFP-CIPK26 was rapidly reduced in estradiol-treated seedlings compared with that in untreated seedlings that did not express HA-KEG (Fig. 5, middle panel). As a control for the assay, estradiol treatment did not affect the stability of GFP-CIPK26 in single- transgenic35S:GFP-CIPK26seedlings (Fig 5, left panel). Taken together, these results suggested that KEG contributes to the turnover of CIPK26. KEG is involved in the turnover of CIPK26. Four-d-old35S:GFP-CIPK26 OlexA:HA-KEGdouble-transgenic seedlings were treated overnight with or without estradiol. CHX was then added to the growth medium and the protein abundance of HA-KEG (top panel) and GFP-CIPK26 (middle panel) were assessed at the indicated time points. As a control,35S:GFP-CIPK26lacking the KEG transgene was subjected to estradiol treatment followed by CHX treatment. Ponceau S shows the protein loading. All blots are representative of a least two trials. Some members of the CIPK family have been found to alter ABA sensitivity, implicating them in the regulation of ABA signal transduction (GongNone, 2002None;KimNone, 2003;PandeyNone, 2008). In addition, clade A type 2C protein phosphatases (PP2Cs) can selectively interact with various CIPKs (OhtaNone, 2003;LanNone, 2011;LeeNone, 2007). Abscisic Acid Insensitive 1 (ABI1) and ABI2 are PP2Cs that negatively regulate ABA signal transduction through dephosphorylation of SnRK2 kinases (MaNone, 2009;ParkNone, 2009). GST pull-down assays were first used to determine whether CIPK26 could also interact with ABI1 and ABI2. GST-tagged ABI1 (GST-ABI1) and GST-ABI2 were both able to interact with and pull down His-Flag-CIPK26C, the portion of CIPK26 that contains the PPI domain (Fig. 6A). The interaction between CIPK26 and ABI1 or ABI2 was verifiedin plantausing BiFC assays. Co-expression of ABI1-YFPNwith CIPK26-YFPC(Fig. 6B) in tobacco leaf epidermal cells resulted in a fluorescent signal in the nucleus and cytoplasm, further suggesting an interaction between ABI1 and CIPK26. Similarly, co-expression of ABI2-YFPCwith CIPK26-YFPN(Fig. 6C) in tobacco leaf epidermal cells resulted in a fluorescent signal in the nucleus and cytoplasm. Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of each construct alone did not produce a fluorescent signal (data not shown). Together, these results provided strong evidence for CIPK26 interaction with the ABA-related phosphatases, ABI1 and ABI2. CIPK26 interacts with ABI1 and ABI2 and has altered ABA sensitivity.

(E) Percentage germination of Col-0, control,35S:GFP-CIPK26(line 1), and35S:GFP-CIPK26(line 2) seeds in the presence (0.25 and 0.5 uM) or absence of ABA. Germination was scored as radical emergence after 36h. 35S:GFP-CIPK26(line 1), and35S:GFP-CIPK26(line 2) were significantly different from the wild type at both ABA concentrations (*,P less than 0.05). Statistical analysis was performed using Student'st-test. The graph represents three independent trials withn greater than =30 seeds per trial. Results are shown as means +/- standard error. The interaction between CIPK26 and ABI1/ABI2 suggested a role for the kinase in ABA signalling. To determine whether CIPK26 is involved ABA signalling, we analysed the ABA response of two independent T-DNA insertional mutant lines,cipk26-1(Salk_005859) andcipk26-2(Salk_074944), which were confirmed to lack expression of theCIPK26transcript (Supplementary Fig. S4A, BatJXBonline). No obvious phenotypic differences were observed betweencipk26-1orcipk26-2and wild-type plants grown under standard growth conditions (data not shown). The germination rate ofcipk26-1andcipk26-2seeds in the presence of ABA was compared with that of the wild type. The germination rate of bothcipk26-1andcipk26-2in the presence and absence of ABA was similar to that of the wild type (Supplementary Fig. S4C). This finding was not unexpected becauseCIPK26is part of a large gene family and may function redundantly with other closely related family members. To overcome the issue of redundancy, we analysed the response of35S:GFP-CIPK26(lines 1 and 2) to ABA-induced inhibition of germination (Fig. 6D). Germination of35S:GFP-CIPK26(lines 1 and 2) seeds were significantly reduced in the presence of 0.25 and 0.5 uM ABA compared with wild-type and control plants (Fig. 6D). These results suggested that the kinase functions as a positive regulator of plant responses to ABA. The above results suggested that CIPK26 mediates ABA signalling. To further explore this hypothesis, we investigated the possibility that ABI5 might be a target of CIPK26 kinase activity. CIPK26 was found to interact with ABI5 in yeast two-hybrid (Fig. 7A) and BiFC (Fig. 7B) assays. For BiFC, co-expression of35S:CIPK26-YFPNoneand35S:ABI5-YFPNoneresulted in a strong fluorescent signal in the nucleus and a weaker fluorescent signal in the cytoplasm of some cells (Fig. 7B). Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of each construct alone did not produce fluorescent signals (data not shown). Kinase assays were then used to determine whether CIPK26 could phosphorylate ABI5. His-Flag-CIPK26N and a constitutively active His-Flag-CIPK26NTDwere both able to phosphorylate His-Flag-ABI5in vitro(Fig. 7C). An inactive version of the kinase, His-Flag-CIPK26NKR, was unable to phosphorylate His-Flag-ABI5 (Fig. 7C). CIPK26 interacts with ABI5 and phosphorylates ABI5in vitro. (A) ABI5 interacts with CIPK26N in yeast two-hybrid screens. ABI5 was fused to a LexA DNA-binding domain (BD) and tested for interaction with CIPK26N fused to the activation domain (AD).

(C)In vitrophosphorylation assays using His-Flag-ABI5 and His-Flag-CIPK26N, inactive His-Flag-CIPK26NKR, or constitutively active His-CIPK26NTD. Top panel: autoradiogram showing phosphorylation of ABI5 by CIPK26N and CIPK26NTD. Bottom panel: Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) staining showing the amounts of purified protein used in the assay. (D) In-gel kinase assays using His-Flag-ABI5 as the cast substrate. Protein extracts were prepared from 8-d-oldkeg-1, ABA (50 uM)-treated and untreated Col-0 seedlings. The autoradiogram shows phosphorylation of ABI5 by various kinases in each protein extract. The arrowhead indicates phosphorylation of ABI5 by an approximately 50kDa kinase inkeg-1and ABA-treated Col-0 seedlings. The severe growth-arrest phenotype observed forkegmutants may be partially explained by the findings that CIPK26 is capable of phosphorylating ABI5 and that KEG regulates the turnover of both CIPK26 and ABI5. In thekegmutant background, accumulation of CIPK26 may lead to the phosphorylation of the accumulated transcription factor, resulting in growth arrest. If this is indeed the case, then the phosphorylation status of ABI5 inkegseedlings should differ from that of the wild type. An in-gel kinase assay utilizing His-Flag-ABI5 as the cast substrate and protein extracts prepared from untreatedkeg-1, untreated wild-type, and ABA-treated wild-type seedlings was carried out to assess the phosphorylation of ABI5. The pattern of ABI5 phosphorylation observed inkeg-1was more similar to that of ABA-treated than that of untreated wild-type seedlings (Fig. 7D). Of note was the observation that a kinase of the same molecular weight as CIPK26, approximately 50kDa, phosphorylated ABI5 inkegas well as in ABA-treated wild-type seedlings, but not in untreated wild-type seedlings. Previous work has shown that KEG, a RING-type E3 ligase, negatively regulates ABA signal transduction by targeting ABI5 for ubiquitin-mediated degradation (StoneNone, 2006;Liu and Stone, 2010). However, the importance of this E3 ligase is not limited to regulation of ABI5 abundance. In this study, we identified CIPK26 as a KEG-interacting protein. We found that CIPK26 is unstable and is degraded by the 26S proteasome under normal growth conditions. In addition, we provided evidence that KEG mediates the proteasomal degradation of CIPK26. CIPK26 was found to interact with ABI1, ABI2, and ABI5, components of the ABA signalling network. In addition, CIPK26 was able to phosphorylate ABI5in vitro. In accordance with acting as a positive regulator of ABA signalling, overexpression ofCIPK26increased the sensitivity of germinating seeds to the inhibitory effects of the hormone. The interaction between KEG and CIPK26 may have various outcomes. For example, CIPK26 may phosphorylate KEG, altering E3 ligase activity. Alternatively, KEG may ubiquitinate CIPK26, targeting the kinase for degradation. In this report, we have provided evidence for the latter. UsingArabidopsisdouble-transgenic plants, we demonstrated that upregulation ofKEGexpression increased CIPK26 degradation, suggesting that KEG promotes the turnover of the kinase. Many kinases are unstable and subject to ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. The distantly related mammalian AMPK is subject to ubiquitin-mediated degradation by the E3 ligase cell death-inducing DFF45-like effector alpha (Cidea) to regulate energy consumption (QiNone, 2008). InArabidopsis, the abundance of SnRK1.2/AKIN11 is reduced through the 26S proteasome in response to phosphate starvation (FragosoNone, 2009). SnRK1.1/AKIN10 is targeted for degradation by the Pleiotropic Response Locus 1 (PRL1), a subunit of a CUL-based E3 ligase (LeeNone, 2008). There is also evidence to suggest that ABA controls the abundance of SnRK1 from wheat (CoelloNone, 2012). Another example of hormone-related kinase degradation is Brassinosteroid-insensitive 2 (BIN2), which is targeted for proteasomal degradation by an unknown E3 ligase in the presence of brassinosteroid (PengNone, 2008). Ubiquitin-mediated degradation of CIPK26 contributes an additional layer of complexity to CIPK regulation. CIPK proteins have an autoinhibitory NAF domain, and Ca2+-sensing CBL proteins are thought to bind to this NAF domain to relieve inhibition and activate the kinase (Weinl and Kudla, 2009). This model has been demonstrated with CBL1- or CBL9-mediated activation of CIPK23 (XuNone, 2006). Alternatively, CIPK proteins can also be activated by phosphorylation within the activation loop (GuoNone, 2001). The identities of upstream kinases that phosphorylate CIPKs within the activation loop are unknown, and the relationship between CBL-mediated activation versus activation loop phosphorylation is unclear. The interaction between clade A PP2Cs such as ABI1/ABI2 and CIPKs creates a phosphorylation/dephosphorylation module (OhtaNone, 2003;LeeNone, 2007). InArabidopsis, there are nine clade A PP2Cs that selectively interact with various CIPKs (LeeNone, 2007;LanNone, 2011). For example, CIPK23 specifically interacts with AKT1-interacting PP2C1 (AIP1) but not with ABI1 or ABI2 (LeeNone, 2007). Using regulation of AKT1 as a model,LanNone(2011) suggested that clade A PP2Cs counteract the activities of CIPK similar to how ABI1/ABI2 inactivate SnRK2s during early ABA receptor-binding events. The interaction between CIPK26 and ABI1/ABI2 may represent a kinase-phosphatase pair that regulates ABA signal transduction. However, further research is required to determine the exact mechanism underlying CIPK26 activation. The finding that CIPK26 can phosphorylate ABI5in vitrosuggests that the kinase may contribute to the ABA response through ABI5 phosphoregulation. ABI5 protein activity is regulated through three ABA-dependent mechanisms: increased transcription, inhibition of proteasomal degradation, and changes in phosphorylation status (Lopez-MolinaNone, 2001,2002). ABI5 is highly unstable and ABA induces molecular events that prohibit its degradation (Lopez-MolinaNone, 2001;Liu and Stone, 2010). However, simple protein accumulation is not sufficient to produce an ABA response because transgenic plants overexpressingABI5do not display an ABA-related phenotype in the absence of the hormone (BrocardNone, 2002;Lopez-MolinaNone, 2003). The accumulated ABI5 must be activated in order to bring about the changes in gene expression required for growth arrest. ABI5 has multiple phosphorylation sites including four within its conserved regions, C1-C4, and is probably phosphorylated by multiple kinasesin plantaincluding SnRKs and calcium-dependent protein kinases (FurihataNone, 2006;FujiiNone, 2007;PiskurewiczNone, 2008;NakashimaNone, 2009;SirichandraNone, 2010). Interestingly, a CIPK from rice, OsCK1, can phosphorylate the ABRE-binding factor, OREB1, within the C4 domain (HongNone, 2011). Phosphorylation within these conserved regions can transactivate members of the ABI5 bZIP family (FurihataNone, 2006;FujiiNone, 2007;HongNone, 2011). The contribution of each kinase to the stability and activation of ABI5 bZIP family members remains to be defined experimentally. Regulation of ABI5 activity via CIPK26-dependent phosphorylation may aid in explaining the severity of thekegmutant phenotype. Unlike otherABI5overexpressing plants,KEGmutants accumulate a high-molecular-weight and possibly phosphorylated form of ABI5 (BrocardNone, 2002;Lopez-MolinaNone, 2003;StoneNone, 2006). Accumulation of CIPK26 inkegmay interfere with CIPK26 regulation, resulting in phosphorylation of targets such as ABI5. CIPK26-mediated phosphorylation of ABI5 inkegmay somehow mimic ABA signalling, leading to the growth arrest ofkegseedlings in the absence of the hormone. AsCIPK26andKEGare found on the same chromosome, it is not possible to generatekeg cipk26double mutants to determine whether loss ofCIPK26could rescue theKEGgrowth-arrest phenotype. The results presented here demonstrated that CIPK26 is degraded through the 26S proteasome and that KEG is involved in mediating this degradation. Our results strongly suggest that KEG may target CIPK26 for degradation to further negatively regulate ABA signalling. Supplementary data are available atJXBonline. Supplementary Fig. S1.
