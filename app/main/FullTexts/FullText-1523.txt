Interactions between the epidermis and underlying mesenchyme drive the development of skin and its appendages, including teeth, hair and nails/claws. The developmental mechanisms are highly conserved among species (ChuongNone, 2001). Primordial nails/claws start to appear on the dorsal surface of the developing distal digits of mouse limbs at E14-15, and morphogenesis is similar in primates and rodents (Hamrick, 2001). The nail/claw fold extends from the epidermis and folds inward to cover the proximal nail plate. The nail fold is succeeded by the nail matrix, which contains proliferating keratinocytes. Keratinocytes dorsal to the matrix start to express epithelial keratins and eventually undergo apoptosis, depositing a cornified structure on the nail plate (Figure 1a). Krt1 and Krt10 are expressed during the initial stages of keratinization and are later replaced by a network of Krt5 and Krt14 that assembles into intermediate filaments and contribute to the cytoskeleton of epithelial cells. Keratins constitute a major component of the cytoskeleton of the differentiated nail plate, and consequently mutations in the corresponding genes can perturb nail formation (ChamcheuNone, 2011;McLean and Moore, 2011). As development continues, cells around the nail matrix migrate into the spinous layer, stop dividing, and begin to synthesize a new set of structural proteins and enzymes characteristic of the nail plate. Additional keratins expressed in the nail matrix include epithelial keratins Krt6A and Krt17, and hard keratins Krt31, Krt33B, Krt34, Krt39, Krt81, Krt85 and Krt86 (BarthelemyNone, 2012;RiceNone, 2010). Keratin filaments aggregate in the presence of filaggrin, and a series of other proteins such as involucrin, loricrin and proline-rich proteins are synthesized and crosslinked by transglutaminases. This reinforces the cornified envelope under the membrane of terminally differentiated keratinocytes (corneocytes). Nail plate formation then ensues. Though the precise molecular signatures and branch points and their timing for nail development remain unclear, regulation of ectodermal appendage formation is partially understood, and is clearly dependent on multiple signaling pathways (Fuchs, 2008). Induction of the nail placode is signaled from the underlying mesenchyme to the overlying epidermis. At this stage Wnt signaling plays a major role, with a system of autocrine and paracrine pathways regulated by several feedback loops (Fuchs, 2008;Widelitz, 2008). The importance of Wnt signaling for the formation of nails has been proven from molecular studies on specific congenital human disorders (Duverger and Morasso, 2008;HillNone, 2006). Autosomal recessive anonychia or hyponychia has been reported to be caused by mutations in the Frizzled agonistR-spondin 4(RSPO4) gene (BergmannNone, 2006;BlaydonNone, 2006), and we have recently reported mutations in theFZD6gene in a severe form of isolated autosomal recessive nail dysplasia (FrojmarkNone, 2011). In addition, mutations in theWNT10Agene are associated with odontoonychodermal dysplasia (OODD) (AdaimyNone, 2007;NawazNone, 2009), and mutations in the WNT-associated transcription factorsLMX1BandMSX1cause Nail-Patella and Witkop syndrome, respectively (DreyerNone, 1998;JumlongrasNone, 2001). To define further the molecular architecture of genes important for nail/claw formation we carried out gene expression profiling in a mouse model with RNAs from wild-type andFzd6Nonedigit tips at three embryonic stages, E14.5, E16.5 and E18.5, times at which early nail development is evident histologically. TheFzd6Nonemouse was originally shown to have altered hair patterning, implying that Fzd6 is involved in a planar polarity system of biological structures (GuoNone, 2004;WangNone, 2010). Subsequent studies showed that theFzd6-ablated mouse is a model for congenital claw dysplasia (FrojmarkNone, 2011). Here we show that theFzd6-ablated mouse embryos show dysregulation of many genes required for epidermal differentiation. Striking abnormalities were observed in the expression of genes encoding proteins of the cornified envelope and keratins that are critical for claw/nail development and claw/nail plate formation. The results thus clarify a range of molecular mechanisms mediated by Fzd6 in normal claw/nail development in distal digits. To infer candidate genes regulated by Fzd6-mediated Wnt signaling during claw development, we carried out genome-wide gene expression profiling with RNAs from digital tips of wild-type andFzd6Nonemouse embryos at E14.5, E16.5 and E18.5 (Figure 1a). As expected, biological triplicates of hybridization were grouped with their genotypes in a hierarchical clustering dendrogram (Figure S1a), and we set criteria for significantly affected genes as log intensity greater than =2.0, FDR less than =0.05 and fold-difference greater than =2.0. ANOVA analysis revealed 650 genes as significantly affected in the knockout embryos at E14.5, 747 genes at E16.5 and 387 genes at E18.5 (Figure 1b). The full list of significantly affected genes is presented inTable S1. Differentially expressed genes were validated using qRT-PCR for the selected transcriptsFzd6,Ivl,HrnrandRptn. Down-regulation ofIvl(p=0.0033) andHrnr(p=0.0026) was confirmed and the expression ofRptnwas reduced, although not significantly (p=0.099) at E16 (Figure S2). Consistent with array data,Ivl,HrnrandRptnwere not differentially expressed at E14 and E18 (data not shown). Reduced expression ofFzd6was confirmed at all time points (p less than 0.01), as expected (Figure S2). As an overall index of expression profiles, we carried out principal component (PC) analysis (Figure S1b). Expression patterns of wild-type andFzd6Nonemice changed progressively during development (arrows inFigure S1b). We found a large number of epidermal differentiation marker genes clustered downward in the knockout along PC1, consistent with their positive induction/regulation by Fzd6. A smaller group of additional "Fzd6-dependent" epidermal differentiation genes were seen with a somewhat different expression pattern along PC2 (Figure S1b). The regulated epidermal differentiation genes encoded many keratins (Krts, clustered on chromosomes 11 and 15); keratin associated proteins (Krtaps, clustered on chromosome 11 and 16); and transglutaminases (Tgms) and their substrates, including late cornified envelope proteins (Lces, clustered on chromosome 3); S100a calcium binding proteins (clustered on chromosome 3); small proline-rich proteins (Sprrs, clustered on chromosome 3); and trichohyalin, loricrin, involucrin and filaggrin (clustered on chromosome 3). We next analyzed these classes further. Keratins can be classified into epithelial keratins (Krt1-24, 76-80), hair follicle specific epithelial keratins (Krt25-28, 71-75), and hard keratins expressed in hair shafts and nails (Krt31-40, 81-86) (MollNone, 2008). By statistical analysis, we found eight hard (nail/hair) keratins significantly down-regulated inFzd6Nonemice (Figure 2a):Krt84andKrt81at E14.5;Krt86,Krt34,Krt33b,Krt32andKrt31at E16.5; andKrt32at E18.5. Immunohistochemical staining revealed Krt86 expression in the suprabasal layers of epidermis in the dorsal digit tips in wild-type mice that was significantly reduced in theFzd6Noneembryos at E16.5 (Figure 4, Krt86). Among the down-regulated keratins, Krt86, Krt81, Krt34 and Krt31 (Figure 2b) have been reported to be expressed in the nail matrix, the region producing the actual nail plate (PerrinNone, 2004). Concomitantly, five keratin associated protein (Krtap) genes --Krtap13-1, Krtap13, Krtap8-1,Krtap3-3, andKrtap3-1-- were sharply down-regulated in the knockout mice at E16.5 (Figure 2a). Krtaps are known to cross-link with hard keratins to form rigid structures in hair (RogersNone, 2006). Additionally, sixteen epithelial keratins were also significantly down-regulated in the knockout mice (Figure 2a). Among them,Krt6aandKrt6bare mutated in the autosomal dominant pachyonychia congenital (PC) disorder, clinically characterized by hypertrophic nail dystrophy, plantar keratoderma and epidermal cysts (McLean and Moore, 2011). Krt6awas significantly down-regulated in the knockout mice at E14.5 and E18.5, whileKrt6bwas down-regulated at E16.5 (Figure 2a). Immunohistochemical staining with Krt6b antibody on wild-type digits at E16.5 showed strong staining mainly in the suprabasal layers of epidermis, including squamous and granular layers and stratum corneum of the nail field, butFzd6Nonemice showed markedly reduced staining confined mainly to the stratum corneum (Figure 4, Krt6b). Notably,Krt79andKrt77were significantly down-regulated in knockout mice at E16.5, but then up-regulated at E18.5 (Figure 2a). By contrast, the third keratin class, hair follicle-specific epithelial keratins (with exception of mild up-regulation of Krt28 at E18.5), was not affected in the knockout mice, presumably because claws/nails lack epithelial structures corresponding to the inner root sheath of hair follicles. Hard keratins were previously shown to be direct transcriptional targets of Wnt signaling (ZhouNone, 1995). The sharp down-regulation of a vast number of hard keratins, epithelial keratins and Krtaps in theFzd6-targeted mice strongly suggests that Fzd6-mediated Wnt signaling regulates formation of the cytoskeleton in developing nails. Another general finding from expression profiling was the downregulation of expression of genes encoding transglutaminases and their cross-linking substrates for the cornified cell envelope (CE) formation, the idiosyncratic structure in terminal differentiation (Figure 3a). The cornified envelope is an insoluble and mechanically resistant membrane structure of terminally differentiated keratinocytes (CandiNone, 2005). Three transglutaminases, Tgm1, 3, and 5, which regulate cornified envelope formation, were sharply down-regulated in theFzd6Nonemice at E14.5 and E16.5 (Figure 3a). Among them, transglutaminase 1 had previously been shown to regulate cornified envelope formation in nail plates (RiceNone, 2003), and mutation in the gene causes lamellar ichthyosis, affecting skin and sometimes nails (HuberNone, 1995). Genes encoding Tgm substrates, including involucrin, trichohyalin, loricrin; twelve late cornified envelope (Lce) proteins; six small proline-rich protein (Sprr) genes; and four S100a calcium binding protein genes were also significantly down-regulated in the knockout mice (Figure 3a). Immunohistochemical staining of involucrin indicates that it is almost absent in suprabasal layers of the claw field inFzd6Nonemice compared to wild-type littermates (Figure 4, Ivl). Figure 3bshows expression patterns ofTgm1and several of its substrates (Lce1h, Sprr1aandinvolucrin) in wild-type and knockout mice at early developmental stages (Figure 3b). Down-regulation of transglutaminases and their substrates in the knockout mice suggests thatFzd6affects formation of the terminally differentiated cornified envelope. Abnormal expression of keratins and cornified envelope components inFzd6Nonemice are consistent with phenotypic observations (FrojmarkNone, 2011). In addition to affecting an unusually wide range of epidermal differentiation-associated genes, ablation ofFzd6Nonealso notably downregulated some signaling proteins known to control skin appendage development and differentiation. The additionally affected genes included members of Wnt, Bmp, Fgf, Tgfalpha and Dhh pathways (Table S2). Among them, expression changes forBmp2K(Bmp2-inducible kinase) in the knockout mice were notable. Similar toFzd6,Bmp2Kwas significantly down-regulated in the knockout mice at all three time points analyzed (Figure 5). The Bmp2-induced kinase contains a nuclear localization domain and has been shown to be involved in Bmp2-induced osteoblast differentiation (LiuNone, 2009). In addition toBmp2K,Bmp8a,Wnt2,Wnt2b,Fgf2,Fgf7, andDhhwere all significantly less expressed in the knockout mice at E14.5 (Table S2). At E16.5,Wnt10b,Dkk4andTgfalphawere significantly down-regulated; and at E18.5,Dkk4andFzd10were less expressed. Dkk4 is an antagonist of Wnt pathway; and in an initial experiment to look at interactive modulation of action of factors within the Wnt system, we examined claw formation in wild-type mice bearing aDkk4transgene. In previous work, although fundamental hair formation occurred unchanged inDkk4transgenic mice in wild-type background, hair subtypes were altered (CuiNone, 2010). For claws as well, a modulatory effect of aDkk4transgene was seen at the maturation stage of development. The effect was subtle but reproducible, with an appreciable change in the thickness and angle of claws, more easily seen on the 3 central digits of the hind paws (inFigure 6, a claw from a transgenic mouse is sharper and is oriented 6-7 degrees more vertically than wild type control claws). Overall, nine of 63 epidermal differentiation marker genes, includingKrt86, Krt34, Krt6aandKrt6b,which were down-regulated inFzd6Noneclaws, were also significantly down-regulated inDkk4transgenic hair follicles (Table S3, and seeFigure S1inCuiNone, 2010). Thus, Dkk4 may interact with a specific Wnt protein regulated by Fzd6. Finally, we also assessed up-regulated genes inFzd6Nonemice. In contrast to a wide range of differentiation marker and signal genes down-regulated in the knockout mice, up-regulated genes did not cluster by function. However, expression of a small number of differentiation related genes and genes encoding signal proteins was up-regulated. The up-regulated genes include Krt18, Krt28, Krt42, Krt77, Krt79, Lce1g (Fig. 2a,3a), and Lrp6, Egfbp2, Wisp2 (Table S2). These might represent secondary feedback effects of down-regulation of the cohort of differentiation-related genes and signaling proteins. The gene expression profile at the site and time of early claw development showed that the lack ofFzd6expression, associated with nail dysplasia in humans, dramatically affects overall expression patterns of keratins and other proteins involved in cornified envelope formation. Our data supports a model in which the Wnt/Fzd signaling pathway, specifically involving Fzd6, plays a key role in claw/nail formation through the activation of required transcription units. We note considerable overlap in the expression of hard keratins and keratin-associated proteins in developing claw compared to shaft composition in hair follicles. They includeKrt31, Krt33b, Krt34, Krt81, Krt86, Krtap3-1andKrtap3-3(BarthelemyNone, 2012). We also identified a broad spectrum of epithelial keratins in the developing claw, ncludingKrt1, Krt4, Krt6a, Krt9, Krt10, Krt13, Krt19andKrt23, which are not found in the mature claw plate (RiceNone, 2010). In addition to these major differences in the composition of the claw plate and hair shaft, several transcripts encoding structural proteins appeared more strongly or exclusively associated with developing claws. They includedKrt6a, Krt6b, Krt7, Krt12, Krt13, Krt18, Krt23, Krt28, Krt42, Krt77, Krt78, Krtap8-1,andKrtap13. These findings thus point to distinctive and characteristic keratin profiles during claw morphogenesis compared to formation of the claw plate. Hallmarks of claw formation, including several keratins and keratin-associated proteins dysregulated in theFzd6Nonemice, are consistent with previous findings that Wnt signaling regulates hard keratin expression (ZhouNone, 1995). The pattern of dysregulated keratins (and transglutaminases and their substrates; see below) varied between time-points, with the largest number at E16.5, the peak time of expression ofFzd6in digit tips during normal development (FrojmarkNone, 2011)(Figure 2a). This finding may suggest a requirement for spatiotemporal action of epidermal differentiation proteins and related enzymes in the early developmental stage of claw plate formation, with a few genes still affected at E18.5. As another indication of temporal succession,Krt6aandKrt6b,mutations in which are associated with pachonychia congenita, were down-regulated, butKrt6awas significantly down-regulated at E14.5 and E18.5, whereasKrt6bwas significantly down-regulated at E16.5. Similar toKrt6b, Krt86, the major keratin of the claw plate, showed a "window" of down-regulation at E16.5 in theFzd6Noneanimals. Mutations inKrt86are associated with monilethrix (fragile hair) (van SteenselNone, 2005), but this has not been reported in patients withFZD6mutations. Thus, the reducedKrt86expression does not seem to affect hair shaft formation significantly. The cornification process has already been specified to involve a large number of structural proteins and enzymes expressed in sequential order (CandiNone, 2005), and interestingly, the gene expression analysis in wild-type mice at E14.5-E18.5 showed considerable overlap with the pattern from skin as well as other epidermal appendages. But idiosyncratic to the digit tips, three key enzymes for the assembly of cornified cell envelope in stratum corneum -- transglutaminase 1, 3 and 5 -- were sharply down-regulated inFzd6mutant mice. Similarly, a series of transglutaminase substrate genes, including those for structural proteins trichohyalin, involucrin, loricrin and several Sprrs and Lces, showed significantly reduced expression, again consistent with the dysplastic nail formation inFzd6Nonemice. In addition, theFzd6-ablated mouse clarifies critical and specific pathways for claw formation. More than 500 genes were significantly dysregulated at the three time points tested in digit tips ofFzd6Nonecompared to wild-type embryos. Consistent with observations during distal limb formation (Geetha-LoganathanNone, 2008), several Wnt signaling molecules were found down-regulated. Notably, Dkk4, a Wnt antagonist, has been shown to be direct target of canonical Wnt signaling (BazziNone, 2007), suggesting a possible feedback regulation of Wnt signaling for nail/claw development mediated by Fzd6 and Dkk4. Figure 6shows that overexpression ofDkk4in wild-type mice modified claw development slightly; and we found 9 differentiation markers down-regulated inFzd6knockout mice that are also down-regulated inDkk4transgenic mice. Thus, Dkk4 may inhibit expression of a specific Wnt or Wnt subset that is positively controlled by Fzd6. In further clues to the regulatory network, the expression of several other signaling proteins was affected. Notably,Bmp2kwas down-regulated at all three time-points suggesting its regulation by Fzd6-mediated signaling. The expression ofBmp2from mesenchymal cells has earlier been shown to be important in the differentiation of epidermal appendages (RendlNone, 2008) and for patterning of distal limbs (MaatoukNone, 2009). Overall, however, the developmental program of claws thus diverges sharply from that of other well-studied skin appendages. In particular, in contrast to hair, teeth, and sweat glands, ectodysplasin is not obviously involved (Cui and Schlessinger, 2006), and the plethora of epithelial keratins made is largely distinct from those seen in hair follicles. In fact,Fzd6Nonemice and humans with homozygousFZD6mutations show normal structures of epidermis and complete formation of hair follicles. Further increasing the complexity of the regulatory network, Wnt signaling has been shown to be involved in epigenetic regulation of its target genes (SierraNone, 2006), a mechanism that is likely operative in the coordinated regulation of epidermal differentiation genes. It is suggestive that 4 clusters of implicated cornified envelop genes (Lces, Sprrs, S100s, and trichohyalin, loricrin, filaggrin) are all nearby on chromosome 3, raising the speculative possibility that they are jointly regulated by a single Wnt-dependent epigenetic alteration. The results imply that protagonist regulators in claw/nail assembly act successively in a regulatory cascade initiated by Wnt/Fzd6; the successive waves of expression (Figures 2,3and5) provide an entree to determine how the concerted action of signaling factors and epigenetic regulation establishes the pattern of gene action. HeterozygousFzd6Nonemice (kindly provided by Dr. J. Nathans) were crossed to generateFzd6None, Fzd6Noneand wild-type offspring. Timed matings were set up to harvest embryos at E14.5, E16.5 and E18.5. The morning after mating was designated as E0.5. Three middle distal phalanges from each limb were excised and immediately frozen on dry ice. Nine digital tips from three limbs of the same embryo were pooled for one replicate, and stored at -80 degrees C freezer until use. Three pooled biological replicates were prepared for each genotype at each embryonic time-point. Tails were collected to isolate genomic DNAs, and genotyping was done as described previously (FrojmarkNone, 2011). Animal experiments were approved by the ethical committee for animal trials, Uppsala County Court, Uppsala, Sweden. Total RNAs were isolated from each of the pooled digit tips using the Trizol Reagent (Life technologies). Total RNA (2.5mug for each replicate) was labeled with Cy3-CTP using a Quick Amp Labeling Kit (Agilent) to generate the experimental target, and the Cy5-CTP-labeled reference target was produced from the mixture of the Stratagene Universal Mouse Reference RNA (composed of total RNAs from 11 mouse cell lines) and 129ES cellular RNA. Labeled targets were purified using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen), quantified on a NanoDrop scanning spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies). An experimental target was then mixed with the reference target and hybridized to the NIA Mouse 44K Microarray v3.0 (whole genome 60-mer oligo arrays manufactured by Agilent Technology, design ID 015087) according to manufacturer's protocol (Two-Color Microarray-Based Gene Expression Analysis Protocol, Product # G4140-90050, Version 5.0.1). Hybridized microarray slides were scanned with an Agilent DNA Microarray Scanner (model G2505-64120). Triplicate data were analyzed by ANOVA with universal reference for normalization and carried out principle component analysis (PCA) (http://lgsun.grc.nia.nih.gov/ANOVA/) (SharovNone, 2005). Universal reference was not used for normalization if the slope of regression between log(Cy5) vs. log(Cy3) is greater than 0.3, and geometric mean of Cy3 is greater than 3 fold higher than geometric mean of Cy5. All data are MIAME compliant and raw data has been deposited in GEO (GSE40763). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed with the Platinum SYBR Green qPCR SuperMix-UDG kit (Invitrogen) then run and analyzed on the MxPro Real-Time PCR System (Stratagene). Primers for quantification were designed to span intron-exon boundaries to ensure that the reactions were cDNA specific. All reactions were performed three times and in triplicates and normalized to GAPDH. Student's two-tailed t-test was used for statistical analysis. All primer sequences are available upon request. Details of the generation ofDkk4transgenic mice were reported previously (CuiNone, 2010). Briefly,Dkk4transgene was subcloned into a Krt14 vector, microinjected into pronuclei of mouse embryos, and followed by implantion into pseudo-pregnant female mice. Potential founders were mated to C57BL/6J mice to identify those passing the transgene. Two 6 month old transgenic mice and two littermates were analyzed for nail formation in this study. For histological analyses, digital tips ofFzd6Noneand wild-type littermates at day E16.5 were fixed in 4% formaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. Three mum planar sections were cut from the middle digit for staining. Immunofluorescent staining was performed using anti-human/mouse Krt6b (Proteintech group, 17391-1-AP), anti-mouse Krt86 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-168332) and anti-human/mouse Involucrin (Abcam, ab53112) using a DAKO autostainer (Dako). The antibodies were detected using a DAKO Chemmate EnVision kit (Dako) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin.
