Initially, cereblon (CRBN) was identified as a target gene for a mild type of mental retardation in humans (1) and was subsequently characterized in several different functional contexts. CRBN interacts directly with large-conductance calcium-activated potassium channels and regulates their surface expression (2). Later, CRBN was identified as a primary target for thalidomide-induced teratogenicity and as a substrate receptor for the E3 ligase complex (3). More recently, we reported that CRBN interacts directly with the alpha1-subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and inhibits activation of the enzyme in vitro (4). AMPK is a metabolic master switch in response to variations in cellular energy homeostasis (5). The activity of AMPK can be modulated by the phosphorylation of a threonine at position 172 (Thr172) in the alpha-subunit by upstream kinases such as LKB1 (6). AMPK inactivates acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) via direct protein phosphorylation and suppresses expression of lipogenic genes, including fatty acid synthase (FAS), thereby inhibiting fatty acid synthesis (7,8). AMPK is implicated in the regulation of hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism, thereby affecting the energy status of the whole body (7,9). Moreover, AMPK was identified as a major pharmacological target protein for the treatment of metabolic diseases. For example, experimental animal models of type 2 diabetes and obesity show that activation of AMPK by metformin or 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside reduces blood glucose levels and improves lipid metabolism (10-12). Our recent study found that CRBN interacted directly with the AMPK alpha1-subunit both in cultured cell lines and in vitro, and the binding sites within the two proteins were localized (4). The levels of the AMPK gamma-subunit and CRBN in the AMPK complex varied in a reciprocal manner; i.e., a higher CRBN content corresponded to lower gamma-subunit content. AMPK activation was reduced as its gamma-subunit content was decreased by CRBN. Thus, it was proposed that CRBN may act as a negative regulator of AMPK in vivo (4). The aims of the current study were to test this hypothesis and to understand the physiological role(s) ofCRBNby generatingCrbnknockout (KO) mice. The results showed that AMPK activity was activated constitutively inCrbnKO mice under normal conditions and thatCrbnKO mice fed a long-term high-fat diet (HFD) showed a marked improvement in their metabolic status. For generation ofCrbnKO mice, heterozygous F1 animals were provided by the knockout mouse service (Macrogen, Seoul, Korea). The targeting vector used to delete a segment containing exon 1 of theCrbngene (1.1 kb) was constructed using a 5' short arm fragment (2.6 kb) and a 3' long arm fragment (7.3 kb), which were ligated into the pOsdupdel vector. The targeting vector was constructed by replacing the 1.1-kb genomic segment with the neomycin cassette. Heterozygous F1 animals were backcrossed with C57BL/6N mice over at least 10 generations before this study. Heterozygous males and females were then bred to produceCrbnKO mice. The genotypes of the WT andCrbnKO mice were determined by RT-PCR using tail genomic DNA and primers specific for wild-type (WT) orCrbnKO alleles (P1, P2, and P3 inFig. 1None). Generation ofCrbnKO mice. A: The vector construct used to generateCrbnKO (Crbn-/-) mice. The genotyping primers are indicated as P1, P2, and P3. B: Genotypes of the WT (Crbn+/+), heterozygous KO (Crbn+/-), and homozygous KO (Crbn-/-) mice were determined by RT-PCR using tail genomic DNA. C: Protein extracts from liver, SKM, or WAT ofCrbn+/+andCrbn-/-mice showing the levels of endogenous Crbn protein as determined by Western blotting. beta-Actin was used as the loading control. (n= 4 per group.) D: Western blots of endogenous AMPK-alpha, P-AMPK-alpha, ACC, and P-ACC inCrbn+/+,Crbn+/-, andCrbn-/-primary MEFs. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as the loading control. The results shown are representative of four independent experiments (EandF). Relative band intensities as determined by densitometric analysis of the blots inD. Error bars represent the SEM. Mice were maintained on a standard chow diet and water ad libitum in pathogen-free conditions and housed in a room with a 12-h light-dark cycle. For induction of obesity and insulin-resistant phenotypes, male mice (5 weeks old;n= 12-13 per group) were fed an HFD (Research Diet D12492) for 14 weeks while being housed separately. Body weight and food intake were recorded throughout the experiments. Food intake was assessed by determining the difference in food weight during a 7-day period. All experiments were approved by the Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology Animal Care and Use Committee. Glucose tolerance tests were performed by intraperitoneally injecting mice withd-glucose (Sigma) at a dose of 2 g/kg body wt after a 16-h fast. Insulin tolerance tests were performed intraperitoneally by injecting human insulin (Sigma) at a dose of 0.75 units/kg body wt after a 4-h fast. Blood samples were collected via the tail vein, and plasma glucose levels were measured using a glucometer (Roche Diagnostics). At the end of the 14-week period, mice were killed and the livers fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin. Paraffin sections (5 mum) were then subjected to hematoxylin and eosin (H E) staining. Cryosections were stained using Oil Red O and counterstained with hematoxylin to visualize the lipid droplets. Total RNA was isolated from liver tissues of the indicated mice with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Expression was normalized against the levels of beta-actin mRNA. The sequences of the primers used in the PCR analyses are described inSupplementary Table 1. All values were expressed as means +/- SEM. Significant differences between groups were determined using two-tailed unpaired Studentttests, and multiple comparisons were performed using one-way ANOVA or two-way repeated-measures ANOVA. Differences withP less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant and are shown in the Figure legends. CrbnKO mice were generated to elucidate the in vivo function ofCrbn. (Fig. 1None). PCR analysis of genomic DNA from the tails ofCrbnKO mice confirmed the loss of the WT gene and the presence of the targeting vector (Fig. 1None). Crbn protein was not detected in the liver, skeletal muscle (SKM), or white adipose tissue (WAT) (Fig. 1None), and all other tissues were tested by Western blot analysis. The daily body weight of both male and female KO mice fed a normal diet from weaning to 12 weeks of age was comparable with that of WT mice (Supplementary Fig. 1A). Our previous study showed that CRBN inhibits the activation of AMPK in vitro by interacting directly with the alpha1-subunit of AMPK (AMPK-alpha1) (4); therefore, the current study examined whetherCrbndeficiency affected AMPK activation (Fig. 1None). First, the phosphorylation of AMPK Thr172 was measured in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). The amount of phosphorylated (P-)AMPK-alpha increased inCrbn+/-andCrbn-/-MEFs (Fig. 1None). ACC is inactivated by phosphorylation of serine 79 after AMPK activation; therefore, we next measured the levels of P-ACC. Increases in P-AMPK were accompanied by higher levels of P-ACC inCrbn+/-andCrbn-/-MEFs compared withCrbn+/+MEFs (Fig. 1None). It was shown previously that the binding of exogenous CRBN to AMPK decreases the amount of gamma-subunits in the AMPK complex (4); therefore, the effects ofCrbnKO on the AMPK complex were tested by immunoprecipitating the endogenous AMPK complex from MEFs (Supplementary Fig. 1None-None). The intensity of the AMPK beta-band did not change greatly (Supplementary Fig. 1None); however, the intensity of the gamma1-subunit band was significantly higher in bothCrbn+/-andCrbn-/-MEFs compared withCrbn+/+(Supplementary Fig. 1None). These results support the hypothesis that CRBN suppresses AMPK activation by reducing the affinity of the gamma1-subunit for the AMPK complex (4). For testing of whetherCrbndeficiency affected the function of AMPK in vivo, the enzymatic activity of AMPK was assessed in the mouse liver by determining its phosphorylation state. AMPK phosphorylation was 8.2-fold higher inCrbnKO mice than in WT (Fig. 2NoneandSupplementary Fig. 2None). Subsequently, the effects ofCrbnKO were investigated under conditions known to activate endogenous AMPK (13,14). The level of AMPK phosphorylation increased in a time-dependent manner in both WT andCrbnKO mice after injection of metformin; however, the level of P-AMPK-alpha was higher inCrbnKO mice than that in WT (Fig. 2NoneandSupplementary Fig. 2None). Similar results were obtained with primary MEFs cultured under serum-deprived conditions. (Supplementary Fig. 2NoneandNone). Overall, these results suggest that AMPK is hyperactivated in the absence ofCrbnin vivo, which further indicates that Crbn acts as an endogenous negative regulator of AMPK. Increased AMPK activation in theCrbn-/-liver. A: Proteins extracted from the livers ofCrbn+/+andCrbn-/-mice were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-AMPK-alpha, anti-P-AMPK-alpha, and anti-beta-actin antibodies. Nine-week-old male mice were used (n= 9 per group). beta-Actin was used to confirm equal protein loading. Error bars represent the SEM. B: Liver lysates were prepared and subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-AMPK-alpha, anti-P-AMPK-alpha, and anti-beta-actin antibodies. The numbers represent the time after intraperitoneal injection of metformin at a dose of 150 mg/kg body wt. Nine-week-old male mice were used (n= 5 per group). beta-Actin was used to confirm equal protein loading. Error bars represent the SEM. For elucidation of the physiological role(s) ofCrbnin vivo, both WT andCrbnKO mice were fed either a normal chow diet or an HFD (Fig. 3NoneandNone). The HFD-induced weight increase was slower and the level of weight gain was much less forCrbnKO mice than for the WT. The body weight of WT mice fed the HFD was significantly higher than that of mice fed the chow diet at 2 weeks, whereas theCrbnKO mice were significantly heavier at 7 weeks (Fig. 3None). The difference in the HFD-induced weight gain of WT andCrbnKO mice was not attributable to their food consumption (Fig. 3None). The initial average weight ofCrbnKO mice was also not significantly different from that of WT mice (Fig. 3NoneandSupplementary Table 2). Crbndeficiency prevented HFD-induced obesity. A-D: Representative images of mice fed a normal chow diet or an HFD at the end of the 14-week experimental period. E: Body weight changes in WT andCrbnknockout mice fed a normal chow diet or an HFD were monitored weekly during the 14-week experimental period. F: Cumulative food consumption of WT andCrbnKO mice fed an HFD for 14 weeks. G: Epididymal fat mass of mice at the end of the 14-week experiment. Error bars represent the SEM (n= 12-13 per group). *Statistical differences (*P less than 0.05,**P less than 0.01,***P less than 0.005,****P less than 0.001) vs. WT mice fed the same diet. Statistical differences (P less than 0.05, P less than 0.01, P less than 0.005, P less than 0.001) vs. mice with the same genotype that were fed the normal chow diet. Necropsies were performed on both WT andCrbnKO mice, which showed thatCrbnKO mice fed the HFD had a lower epididymal fat mass than WT (Fig. 3NoneandNone). After 14 weeks on the HFD, the average epididymal fat mass of WT mice was 2.7-fold higher than that ofCrbnKO. CrbnKO mice fed with a normal chow diet had lower epididymal fat masses than WT (Fig. 3None). These observations suggest that mice lacking Crbn experienced greater protection from body fat accumulation and obesity caused by high fat intake. The effects of HFD on the morphology and lipid content of the liver inCrbnKO mice were tested next. A comparison of the livers from HFD-fed WT andCrbnKO mice showed that WT livers were much larger, heavier, and paler than those ofCrbnKO mice (Fig. 3NoneandFig. 4None). The hepatic triglyceride (TG) content was significantly lower in HFD-fedCrbnKO mice than in the WT. The TG content was also lower inCrbnKO mice fed the normal chow diet than in WT (Fig. 4None). Hepatic cholesterol levels were also higher in both WT and Crbn KO mice fed an HFD (Fig. 4None). Crbndeficiency in the mouse liver prevented fatty liver. A: Liver mass of WT andCrbnKO mice fed a normal chow diet or HFD at the end of the 14-week experimental period. B: Hepatic TG levels. C: Hepatic cholesterol levels. D-G: Liver sections of the indicated mice were stained with H E. Scale bar = 50 mum. H-K: Lipids in the liver section of the indicated mice were stained with Oil Red O. Scale bar = 50 mum. Error bars represent the SEM (n= 9-10 per group). *Statistical differences (*P less than 0.05,**P less than 0.01,***P less than 0.005,****P less than 0.001) vs. WT mice fed the same diet. Statistical differences (P less than 0.05, P less than 0.01, P less than 0.005, P less than 0.001) vs. mice with the same genotype that were fed the normal chow diet. In agreement with these results, H E staining of liver sections showed that the livers of HFD-fed WT mice contained unstained lipid inclusions, which were less abundant in the livers of HFD-fedCrbnKO mice (Figs. 4None). Oil Red O staining of lipids further confirmed the massive accumulation of neutral lipids in the livers of WT mice fed an HFD, which is a hallmark of fatty liver, but not in the livers ofCrbnKO fed an HFD (Figs. 4None). Thus,Crbndeficiency prevented the accumulation of fats in the epididymal tissues and liver, which made the livers more resistant to fatty liver, which is normally caused by high fat intake. CrbnKO mice were largely protected from HFD-induced obesity and fatty liver; therefore, we next investigated their metabolic parameters. When fed an HFD, WT mice showed significantly higher levels of serum glucose, insulin, and leptin than mice fed normal chow (Fig. 5None), which suggests impaired insulin sensitivity. However, the serum levels of glucose, insulin, and leptin were significantly lower in HFD-fedCrbnKO mice. Other plasma metabolic parameters were also measured in both WT andCrbnKO mice fed normal chow or the HFD (Supplementary Fig. 3). Under both diet conditions, WT and Crbn KO mice showed similar serum levels of TG, cholesterol, resistin, adiponectin, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, MCP-1, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. By contrast, the serum nonesterified FFA levels ofCrbnKO mice fed an HFD were lower than those in the WT (Supplementary Fig. 3None), which agrees with a previous report showing that type 2 diabetic patients with a fatty liver are substantially more insulin resistant and have higher levels of plasma FFA (15). Increased glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity were also confirmed in HFD-fedCrbnKO mice. (Fig. 5NoneandNone). These results demonstrate thatCrbndeficiency may prevent glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, which are normally induced by a long-term HFD. Glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity inCrbn-/-mice under HFD conditions.

Error bars represent the SEM (n= 9-10 per group). *Statistical differences (*P less than 0.05,**P less than 0.01,***P less than 0.005,****P less than 0.001) vs. WT mice fed the same diet. Statistical differences (P less than 0.05, P less than 0.01, P less than 0.005, P less than 0.001) vs. mice with the same genotype that were fed the normal chow diet. For elucidation of the molecular basis of the phenotypic changes observed inCrbnKO mice fed an HFD, expression profiling was performed for several metabolic enzymes. AMPK activation was also monitored. The level of P-AMPK was lower in mice fed an HFD (Fig. 6None), which is in agreement with previous studies (16,17). The total AMPK expression level was not different between WT andCrbnKO mice fed a normal chow diet or an HFD, whereas P-AMPK was significantly higher inCrbnKO mice fed an HFD than in WT mice fed an HFD (Fig. 6None). Furthermore, the ratio of P-ACC to total ACC was consistent with the level of AMPK-alpha activation (Fig. 6None). Despite the hyperphosphorylation of AMPK, the expression levels of the AMPK upstream kinases,liver kinase and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase beta, were similar inCrbnKO mice and WT mice (Supplementary Fig. 4), suggesting that these kinases may not be involved in AMPK activation inCrbnKO mice. CrbnKO mice fed an HFD showed AMPK activation and ACC inhibition in the liver.

Error bars represent the SEM (n= 9-10 per group). *Statistical differences (*P less than 0.05,**P less than 0.01,***P less than 0.005,****P less than 0.001) vs. WT mice fed the same diet. Statistical differences (P less than 0.05, P less than 0.01, P less than 0.005, P less than 0.001) vs. mice with the same genotype that were fed the normal chow diet. There were no statistical differences in the expression ofSREBP1CorChREBP(Fig. 7NoneandNone), a major regulator of lipogenesis (18,19) between the groups; however, the expression ofPPARgamma, a lipogenic transcription factor (20,21), was significantly lower inCrbnKO fed either a normal chow diet or an HFD compared with that in WT mice fed these diets (Fig. 7None). The expression ofFAS, which is involved in fatty acid synthesis, andDGAT2, a rate-limiting enzyme that catalyzes the final step of TG synthesis (22,23), was reduced inCrbnKO mice fed a normal chow diet or the HFD (Fig. 7NoneandNone). These results are consistent with the finding that the level of hepatic TG was lower inCrbnKO mice fed both the normal chow diet and the HFD compared with that in the WT mice (Fig. 4None). The expression levels ofACC1andSCD1mRNA were significantly lower in HFD-fedCrbnKO mice than in HFD-fed WT (Fig. 7NoneandNone). Expression ofG6Pase, but notPEPCK, was significantly lower inCrbnKO mice fed both the normal chow diet and the HFD than in WT (Fig. 7NoneandNone). The expression ofL-PK, which is a key enzyme involved in glycolysis, was significantly higher in WT mice fed the HFD; however, its upregulation was completely abrogated inCrbnKO mice fed the HFD (Fig. 7None). This result is consistent with serum glucose levels (Fig. 5None) becauseL-PKgene transcription is positively regulated by glucose and insulin (24,25). The pattern of AMPK activation (Fig. 6None) is also consistent with the reciprocal pattern of mRNA expression forL-PKandG6Pase(Fig. 7NoneandNone); AMPK activation inhibits the expression ofL-PK(25,26) andG6Pase(27). Expression ofFGF21was 10.3-fold higher in WT mice fed an HFD than in WT fed a normal chow diet (Fig. 7None), which is consistent with a previous report showing that obesity may be considered an FGF21-resistant state (28). However,FGF21expression was only 3.7-fold higher in Crbn KO mice fed an HFD than that inCrbnKO mice fed normal chow. The mRNA expression levels ofHMGCS,which is involved in cholesterol biosynthesis, were 1.8-fold higher in HFD-fed WT mice compared with those in normal chow-fed WT mice (Fig. 7None). Unexpectedly,HMGCSexpression was 1.7-fold higher inCrbnKO mice fed normal chow than in WT fed normal chow. The induction ofHMGCSinCrbnKO mice fed a normal chow diet did not correlate with the observed phenotypes of the WT andCrbnKO mice. This may be due to compensatory gene induction to maintain hepatic homeostasis. There were no changes in the expression ofDhcr24, which is involved in cholesterol biosynthesis andHSL, which is involved in lipolysis (Fig. 7NoneandNone). The protein expression patterns of ACC1, FAS, SCD1, G6Pase, and Crbn (Fig. 6NoneandNone) were consistent with the mRNA expression profiles shown inFig. 7. Expression of ACC1 was also increased in WT mice fed an HFD compared with those fed a normal chow diet (Fig. 6None). Overall, these results show that the disruption ofCrbnaffects the expression of many key metabolic genes. The expression of several lipogenic and gluconeogenic proteins, which are upregulated by HFD, was significantly lower in the livers ofCrbnKO mice, which may be explained by the constitutive activation of AMPK (9,23,25-27). Deletion ofCrbnresulted in the defective expression of genes involved in hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism. A-O: Total RNA was isolated from the liver tissues of the indicated mice and subjected to quantitative real-time PCR analysis to determine the expression ofSREBP1C(A),ChREBP(B),PPARgamma(C),FAS(D),DGAT2(E),ACC1(F),SCD1(G),PEPCK(H),G6Pase(I),FGF21(J),HMGCS(K),Dhcr24(L),L-PK(M),HSL(N), andCrbn(O). Expression was normalized against beta-actin mRNA levels. Fold changes in the mRNA levels relative to WT mice fed a normal chow diet, which were set arbitrarily at 1.0, are shown. Error bars represent the SEM (n= 9-10 per group). *Statistical differences (*P less than 0.05,**P less than 0.01,***P less than 0.005,****P less than 0.001) vs. WT mice fed the same diet. Statistical differences (P less than 0.05, P less than 0.01, P less than 0.005, P less than 0.001) vs. mice with the same genotype that were fed the normal chow diet. Crbnis evolutionarily conserved between plants and animals and is expressed widely in various mammalian tissues. For validation of the in vivo function ofCrbnas a novel regulator of AMPK,CrbnKO mice were established. TheCrbnKO mice were viable, with no apparent defects in gross morphology or basic behavior. As suggested by a previous knockdown study of endogenous CRBN in cultured cell lines (4), endogenous AMPK was constitutively hyperactivated inCrbnKO mice under normal conditions in all tissues tested; therefore,CrbnKO mice were fed an HFD before assessment of the effects ofCrbndeficiency on several parameters: body weight, fatty liver, glucose homeostasis, insulin resistance, and metabolic parameters. In general,CrbnKO mice fed an HFD showed a significant improvement in their metabolic profiles compared with HFD-fed WT control mice. Also,CrbnKO mice showed no signs of metabolic syndrome, even after 14 weeks on an HFD. Fat accumulation within the epididymal tissue and liver was also markedly reduced in KO mice. Thus, it was hypothesized that hyperactivity of AMPK inCrbnKO mice was the major contributor to the overall improvement in lipid and glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. It was intriguing that Crbn expression was significantly upregulated, whereas that of P-AMPK was correspondingly downregulated in the livers of WT mice on an HFD. This observation agreed with our previous prediction that Crbn might negatively regulate the functional activity of AMPK in vivo (4). The current study focused on the effects ofCrbnKO on the liver and hepatic metabolism because the liver plays a key role in controlling overall energy status, whereas AMPK coordinates changes in the hepatic enzymes involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Activation of hepatic AMPK inhibits lipogenesis, cholesterol synthesis, and glucose production (7,8,29). The lower expression of lipogenic regulators, includingFAS,ACC1,SCD1,PPARgamma, andDGAT2, observed in HFD-fedCrbnKO mice suggests that inhibition of hepatic lipogenesis may contribute to lower levels of fat accumulation. The hepatic expression ofG6Pasewas lower inCrbnKO mice fed an HFD, suggesting lower levels of gluconeogenesis. Consistent with these findings, the glucose and insulin tolerance tests showed restoration of normal levels inCrbn-deficient mice fed an HFD. Infection with adenovirus encoding a dominant-negative AMPK mutant (Ad-DN-AMPK) increased the glucose output of primaryCrbnKO hepatocytes in a dose-dependent manner in comparison withCrbnKO hepatocytes infected with Ad-GFP (Supplementary Fig. 5). Collectively, this suggests that the primary mechanism by which KO ofCrbnreduces lipogenesis and gluconeogenesis in the liver operates, at least in part, by regulating AMPK and ACC activity via protein phosphorylation. Furthermore, the levels of Crbn protein and P-AMPK showed a strongly correlation in vivo because the levels of Crbn expression increased as P-AMPK expression decreased in WT mice fed an HFD. There were several noticeable changes in the expression of key metabolic genes inCrbnKO mice fed a regular chow diet, suggesting a physiological role forCrbnunder normal conditions. For example, the expression of lipogenic genes, such asFAS,PPARgamma, andDGAT2and a gluconeogenic gene,G6Pase, was significantly lower. In a good agreement with these findings, hepatic TG levels and the epididymal fat mass were lower inCrbnKO mice fed a regular diet than in WT fed a regular diet. However, morphological phenotypes, including body weight, liver weight, liver morphology, liver section, glucose tolerance, and insulin sensitivity, were similar in WT andCrbnKO mice before the HFD was started. Therefore,Crbndeficiency conferred greater resistance to a metabolic syndrome phenotype under severe pathophysiological conditions (such as a HFD) but not under normal physiological conditions. In our previous report, AMPK-alpha1was identified as a CRBN-binding protein (4). Two isoforms of the AMPK-alpha, AMPK-alpha1and AMPK-alpha2, are found in mammals (30). AMPK complexes containing each alpha-subunit isoform were equally represented in terms of total AMPK activity in the liver (26). The current study examined the interaction between AMPK-alpha2and Crbn. There was no difference in the binding affinity of Crbn for AMPK-alpha1or AMPK-alpha2(Supplementary Fig. 6). This was because the putative Crbn-binding site in AMPK-alpha1is within a region covering amino acids 394-422 (4), which is also highly conserved in AMPK-alpha2(within a region covering amino acids 388-417). These results suggested that Crbn can modulate cellular AMPK, irrespective of its subtype. It is important to determine whether theCrbn-dependent inhibition of AMPK is also conserved in other organisms, especially humans. Our previous study showed that the activity of AMPK was inhibited by the expression of exogenous Crbn in human, rat, and mouse cell lines (4), so it is likely that the negative regulation of AMPK by CRBN also occurs in humans. Recently,CRBN,which is located in the 3p26-25 region in humans, was identified as a target gene for obesity and insulin. Several single nucleotide polymorphisms close to theCRBNgene are associated with central obesity and high blood pressure in humans and the mice (31), indicating the potential clinical relevance of CRBN in metabolic syndromes. However, several important questions still need to be addressed. First, the regulation ofCrbngene expression is not understood. Crbnexpression was upregulated in the long term by high fat intake (Fig. 6Noneand7None). This observation implies that Crbn is induced by an HFD and that CRBN regulates AMPK activity via a negative-feedback loop in vivo. Interestingly, at least three putative sterol regulatory elements and one putative PPARgamma binding site are located within -850 bp upstream of the promoter region within the mouseCrbngene. These two transcriptional factors regulate lipogenesis, which may provide mechanistic insights into the nutrient-dependent modulation ofCrbnexpression. Second, it is not clear how AMPK is regulated by Crbn in other organs. The physiological roles of AMPK are established in other organs such as adipose tissue and SKM, but it was not possible to discern the contributions of these organs to the metabolic phenotype inCrbnKO mice. The activation of AMPK in WAT and SKM was higher inCrbnKO mice than in WT mice (Supplementary Fig. 7). Thus, it is feasible that other organs relative to metabolism may be affected in a way similar to the liver inCrbnKO mice. The liver is regarded as the core center for maintaining glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism, so understanding the normal physiology and the pathophysiology of hepatic metabolism is a prerequisite to understanding whole-body metabolism (7,9,26). Of a variety of tissues tested, the activity of AMPK is lowest in brain and SKM and highest in the liver (32). This may underlie why deletion ofCrbn, a negative regulator of AMPK, most affects the liver inCrbnKO mice. In addition, alterations in liver function clearly affect whole-body metabolism and underlie the development of metabolic diseases, including type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndromes (7,9). Thus, the current study of the role of Crbn in hepatic metabolism may be the first step toward a greater understanding of the physiological function ofCrbnat the molecular level during normal and diseased states. In summary, this study provides the first in vivo evidence that Crbn negatively regulates the activation of AMPK and thatCrbndeficiency protects mice from obesity, fatty liver, and insulin resistance caused by an HFD. Thus, CRBN may be considered a novel regulator of body metabolism and energy homeostasis.
