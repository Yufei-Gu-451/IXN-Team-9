The efficient and selective synthesis of chiral compounds for which asymmetric catalysis has played a pivotal role is essential to the pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries. NoneStudies on how these chiral catalysts induce enantioselectivity have inspired the evolution of new chiral catalysts and the development of subsequent generations of enantioselective reactions. The ProPhenol ligand (1a) is a salient member of the aza-crown family of ligands,Nonewhose origin was inspired by the pioneering work of Cram on chiral crown compounds. NoneProline-derived1aforms dinuclear main group metal catalysts via the direct deprotonation of three hydroxyl groups (Scheme1). Both gas titration experiments and electrospray mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) have been used to support the formation of the Zn-ProPhenol complex2from diethyl zinc and1a. NoneFurthermore, Ding and co-workers were able to characterize ap-nitrophenoxy derivative (3) of compound2by X-ray crystallography (Scheme2). NoneIn addition, the crystal structure of an analogous dinuclear magnesium ProPhenol complex has also been reported. NoneThe ProPhenol ligand has been used to ligate a number of different main group metals including lithium, magnesium, zinc, zinc/magnesium (heterobimetallic), cobalt, and bismuth (vide infra). NoneThese bimetallic complexes contain both a Lewis acidic and Bronsted basic site and are capable of activating both an electrophile and a nucleophile within the chiral pocket created by the two diaryl(oxy)methyl groups (Figure1). THF omitted for clarity. Quadrant view of the zinc-prophenol chiral pocket and additive coordination. The concise and modular route used to prepare the ProPhenol ligand has enabled tailoring of the chiral pocket for specific reactions by introducing additional substituents on the pyrrolidine rings and the aryl ring (vide infra). A facile procedure has been developed for the recovery of the ProPhenol ligand1aon multigram scale, whereby the bis-sodium salt is filtered off and1ais recovered in 95% yield. NoneIn general, dual catalysis has proven a powerful approach to asymmetric catalysis. NoneHowever, ProPhenol complexes have the added benefit of dictating the orientation of both electrophile and nucleophile by binding the two substrates within the same chiral pocket. Formation of this type of ternary complex followed by product dissociation bears a striking resemblance to the catalytic mechanism used by a number of enzymes. At the time that we began to explore the direct aldol reaction, a potentially powerful and efficient method for the enantioselective formation of carbon-carbon bonds by avoiding the use of chiral auxiliaries and the need for prior formation of an enolate or enol silane, this topic was just starting to become a major endeavor. NoneThe ProPhenol ligand (1a), which was initially developed for the direct aldol reaction, was based on the hypothesis that an aza-semicrown ligand would bind metal ions tightly enough to provide a good template for the design of a chiral pocket but not too tightly to prevent catalytic turnover. Furthermore, the increased basicity of zinc bound in this motif was envisioned to provide, after C-C bond formation, a Zn-alkoxide (shown in red) that could serve as a base for subsequent enolate formation and facilitate catalyst turnover while also avoiding unwanted epimerization and product elimination (Scheme3). The first report of the ProPhenol ligand by Trost and Ito in 2000 showed that just 5 mol % of the ProPhenol ligand and 10 mol % Et2Zn could be used to facilitate the asymmetric aldol reaction with a variety of acetophenone derivatives (Scheme4). NoneReaction performed at -20 degrees C.96% recovery of excess ketone. Zn-ProPhenol-catalyzed reactions have proven to be highly tunable, and a variety of additives have been used to boost both yield and enantioselectivity. The benefits of most additives appear to be somewhat substrate specific and, in aldol reactions, have been postulated to reduce aggregation, fill open coordination sites on the catalyst, and mitigate base-mediated side reactions. The direct aldol reaction with methyl vinyl ketone (4, MVK), a donor that has not been reported with any other asymmetric catalyst system, was performed with 5 equiv ofiPrOH and provided a variety of highly versatile beta-hydroxy enones (Scheme5). NoneThese beta-hydroxy enones are versatile precursors to the corresponding 1,3-synor 1,3-antidiols through stereocontrolled reduction of the ketone. In addition, the alkene could be functionalized using either alkene cross metathesis, to give5, or a diastereoselective [3 + 2] cycloaddition with a nitrile oxide to provide6. Furthermore, the Zn-ProPhenol catalyzed aldol reaction with methyl vinyl ketone was recently used in the synthesis of the ring A and B subunits of the bryostatins. NoneThe use of Lewis basic additives in aldol reactions with methyl ynone donors gave rise to a number of surprising results (Scheme6). NoneAstonishingly, it was discovered that the sense of enantioinduction changes over the course of the reaction, withent-7being formed as the major product (69% ee) during the first 5 min. This led to the hypothesis that aldol product7might be involved in the enantiodetermining step. Indeed, the addition of either chiral or achiral beta-hydroxy carbonyl compounds led to improvements in enantioselectivity during the first 45 min of the reaction (Scheme6). Interestingly, catalyst loadings as low as 2 mol % gave good results (Scheme6, entry 6). Ultimately, the use of additive-free conditions and higher temperature in the direct aldol reaction was found to provide excellent enantioselectivity and good to moderate yields with silyl, alkyl, and unsubstituted butyn-2-ones (Scheme7). The latter two results are particularly noteworthy given the propensity of these substrates to undergo unwanted conjugate addition. Furthermore, this reaction was used to great effect in the total synthesis of lasonolide A and fostriecin (Scheme8). NoneReaction performed with 2 mol % catalyst loading. Zn-ProPhenol complexes have also been shown to facilitate acetone aldol reactions in good yield and enantioselectivity (Scheme9). NoneWhile the standard ProPhenol ligand (1a) provided good results with a variety of aliphatic and aryl aldehydes, the use of1b, containing a 3,5-dimethyl phenol motif, provided slightly improved yield and enantioselectivity in a number of cases. The two methyl groups in this motif are believed to have a buttressing effect on the prolinol groups to reinforce the chiral pocket. A major challenge in aldol reactions with acetone is the avoidance of unwanted elimination, which is particularly problematic in the reaction of benzaldehyde with acetone; only 12% yield of8was obtained when using 10 mol %1b. However, lowering the catalyst loading to 5 mol % provided a much improved 78% yield and 83% ee of the desired product. Thesyn-1,2 diol motif is common in a number of bioactive natural products, and in contrast to dihydroxylation, the asymmetric aldol reaction represents a particularly efficient means of constructing this unit. NoneUsing just 2.5 mol % of the ProPhenol ligand and a slight excess of an alpha-hydroxy acetophenone donor, we could obtain a range ofsyn-1,2 diols in high yield and stereoselectivity (Scheme10). NoneThis methodology was used to facilitate the direct aldol reaction of 2-hydroxyacetylfuran with an enolizable aldehyde and enable the enantioselective total synthesis of boronolide. NoneInterestingly, the absolute configuration of the beta-hydroxy group is the opposite of that obtained with acetophenone donors. Presumably, this reversal is due to the bridging of the alpha-oxygenated enolate between the two zinc atoms, which results in addition to the opposite enantiotopic face of the aldehyde (Figure2). Reaction performed with (R,R)-1afor 12 h on a 16 mmol scale. Proposed bidentate coordination of alpha-hydroxyketone donors. Relative to ketone-based donors, ester enolate equivalents have proven much less reactive as aldol donors. Furthermore, ester equivalents are typically not amenable to organocatalytic direct aldol reactions, thus making an efficient synthesis of beta-hydroxy esters particularly valuable. The development of a formal alpha-hydroxyacetate aldol reaction began with the screening of a number of different activated ester equivalents in reactions with the ProPhenol ligand1aand Et2Zn (Scheme11). NoneThe use of anN-acylpyrrole donor was found to be superior to both 2-acylimidazole andN-acylbenzoxazolinone donors. Futhermore, substitution at the 2-position of the pyrrole provided improved diastereoselectivity, and thereforeN-(alpha-hydroxyacetyl)-2-ethylpyrrole (9) was chosen as the activated ester equivalent. Both of the ProPhenol ligands1aand1bprovided good yield and stereoselectivity in aldol reactions of9with aliphatic, aryl, and alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehydes, with ligand1bleading to slightly improved results in some cases (Scheme12). The products from these aldol reactions have shown great synthetic utility because theN-acylpyrrole group can be converted to the corresponding ester, amide, or ketone in a single step (Scheme13). Furthermore, this methodology provided a key step in the total synthesis of laulimalide. NoneReaction performed at -15 degrees C for 72 h.Esters, in the form of glycine Schiff bases (i.e.,10), also could be used directly as donors in ProPhenol-catalyzed aldol reactions (Scheme14). NoneOptimization by providing additional steric constraint in the chiral pocket led to higher stereoselectivity. The ProPhenol ligand [(S,S),(S,S)]-1cproved best. High yield and stereoselectivity were obtained with a range of aliphatic aldehydes (Scheme15). Furthermore, catalyst control was found to override the influence of alpha-chiral aldehydes, and while a small matched/mismatched effect was observed, high diastereoselectivity was obtained regardless of the configuration of the alpha-stereocenter of the acceptor. Both the methyl and t-butyl esters of the glycinate Schiff base proved effective, in contrast to other chiral catalysts for this transformation. NoneYield of the isolated pure 1,2-syndiastereomer. A versatile alternative to the aforementioned alpha-hydroxy and alpha-amino ester enolate equivalents is the diazo ester aldol reaction. NoneThe unique reactivity of the resulting beta-hydroxy-alpha-diazo esters can be used to prepare a wide range of 1,2-diols and alpha-hydroxy-beta-amino esters in a stereoselective manner (vide infra). For this process, the use of di-n-butylmagnesium, in place of diethylzinc, provided the desired product12in a modest 27% ee (Scheme16). NoneGuided by the notion that open coordination sites on zinc were occupied by multiple equivalents of ethyl diazoacetate, the use of a bidentate coordinating agent,cis-1,2-cyclopentanediol16(Scheme16), combined with a higher reaction concentration (1.0 M) and slow addition of ethyl diazoacetate led to further improvements, providing12in 95% yield and 95% ee. Scheme17illustrates the scope of the reaction. Further, the resulting enantioenriched beta-hydroxy-alpha-diazo esters serve as versatile synthetic intermediates with a wealth of possible reactivity as depicted in Scheme18, whereby oxidation of the diazo group with dimethyldioxirane (DMDO) is followed by nucleophilic addition to the resulting ketone. This reaction sequence enables the rapid and stereoselective preparation of vicinal diols of considerable molecular complexity. For example, a three step sequence was used to convert a beta-hydroxy-alpha-diazo ester into compound17, a fragment present in a number of polyketide antibiotics including azithromycin. NoneInterestingly, the ProPhenol ligand was used to facilitate the diastereoselective methylation of a beta-hydroxy-alpha-keto ester en route to17. In the absence of1a, a complex mixture of products was obtained from this methyl addition. Reaction performed with (R,R)-1a. Reaction conducted at 0.5 M.Aldehyde (2 equiv) added. beta-Amino acid derivatives can also be prepared from diazo ester aldol adducts using trichloroacetonitrile and sodium hydride to convert the alcohol to the corresponding trichloroacetamide (Scheme19). NoneThis C-O to C-N transfer occurs with retention of absolute configuration. Starting material had an ee of 97%. For experimental details see ref (25). The Mannich reaction is a highly efficient method for the preparation of beta-amino carbonyl compounds. NoneThe Zn-ProPhenol catalyst (1a/Et2Zn) was found to facilitate the direct Mannich reaction with a range of alpha-hydroxy acetophenones (Scheme20). NoneAno-methoxyaryl imine improved the stereocontrol compared with ap-methoxy analog, presumably due to coordination of the ortho methoxy group to zinc. Improved diastereoselectivity was obtained with the ProPhenol ligands1fand1g, which contain bulky 4-biphenyl and 2-naphthyl groups, respectively. Substrates containing more labile N-protecting groups on the imine, such as diphenylphosphinoyl (DPP) and Boc, were also found to be effective in the ProPhenol-catalyzed Mannich reaction and enabled the use of enolizable aliphatic imines, which are typically challenging substrates. NoneInterestingly, the bulky DPP group led to selective formation of theanti-1,2-amino alcohol (Scheme21), whereas the Boc-imine resulted in the preferential formation of the correspondingsyn-diastereomer (Scheme22). In both cases, the absolute configuration at the alpha-position is the same and is likely attributed to bidentate coordination of the alpha-hydroxy ketone enolate with the dinuclear zinc catalyst. Wang and co-workers have recently reported an elegant application of the Zn-ProPhenol catalyzed Mannich reaction, using 5H-oxazolones as donors to form two adjacent stereocenters, one of which is tetrasubstituted (Scheme23). NoneIn this case, a 2-thienyl variant of the ProPhenol ligand, (S,S)-1h, plus the use of an additive, diethyl phosphoramidate (18), to block open coordination sites on zinc was found to provide superior diastereoselectivity, relative to1a, and the Mannich product19was obtained in 89% yield, 97:3 dr, and 95% ee. Furthermore, the preformed Zn-complex derived from1h/Et2Zn/18was found to be relatively air stable, and identical results were obtained when the reaction was performed open to air with the preformed complex. The Zn-ProPhenol catalyst was also found to be effective with nitronate-based nucleophiles in enantioselective nitro-Mannich (or aza-Henry) reactions (Scheme24). NoneWhile a number of effective catalyst systems have been reported for the enantioselective aza-Henry reaction with aryl- and aliphatic imines,Nonethe results in Scheme24constitute a rare example of asymmetric addition to alpha,beta-unsaturated imines. Given the facile conversion of beta-nitro amines into 1,2-diamines and the synthetic utility of enantioenriched allylic amines, these results represent a valuable extension of the aza-Henry reaction. Analogous reactivity was also exploited in a ProPhenol-catalyzed Henry reaction with aryl aldehydes (Scheme25). NoneSubsequent reduction of the nitro groups in20and21led to the total synthesis of (-)-denopamine and (-)-arbutamine, respectively. Reaction performed with 30 mol % ProPhenol, 60 mol % Et2Zn. Reaction performed at room temperature. The Zn-ProPhenol catalyst was found to facilitate the asymmetric conjugate addition of alpha-hydroxy ketones to nitroalkenes (Scheme26) to form the adducts22. None,NoneInterestingly, generating the catalyst with an equimolar mixture of Et2Zn and Bu2Mg led to a synergistic effect, whereby higher diastereoselectivity was obtained while also maintaining high ee. The presence of alkyl, alkynyl, and electron-rich aryl substituents on the nitroalkene typically provided higher diastereoselectivities relative to beta-nitrostyrene. Further, 2-hydroxyacetylfuran also served as an excellent donor. The gamma-nitro ketones produced from these reactions are particularly useful intermediates in the stereoselective synthesis of pyrrolidines. NoneOxazolones were found to be effective pronucleophiles in ProPhenol-catalyzed asymmetric conjugate additions with nitroalkenes using the bulky 2-naphthyl variant1gto provide23in excellent yield and stereoselectivity (Scheme27). NoneThe aryl group of the oxazolone was found to have a significant impact on diastereoselectivity, with 3-methylbenzene providing the highest stereoselectivity. The products obtained from this reaction can be readily converted to the corresponding alpha-hydroxy carboxamide using NaOH. NoneAn analogous transformation with 2(5H)-furanone was developed, harnessing vinylogous nucleophilicity to create enantioenriched butenolides (Scheme28). The reaction concentration at 0.5 M proved significant in obtaining high diastereoselectivity. Absolute configuration determined by X-ray crystallography. Nitroalkenes also serve as efficient acceptors in the ProPhenol-catalyzed Friedel-Crafts alkylation of pyrroles. NoneUsing 10 mol % catalyst loading and 3 equiv of pyrrole, we obtained high yield and enantioselectivity with both aryl and alkyl substituted nitroalkenes (Scheme29). Additionally, Wang and co-workers have reported the ProPhenol-catalyzed Friedel-Crafts alkylation of indoles with aldimines. NoneYield based on recovered starting material. The ProPhenol ligand has also been used to facilitate the enantioselective alkylation of hydroxyoxindoles24to form spirocyclic gamma-lactones (Scheme30) in a 2:1 mixture of acetonitrile and toluene at 40 degrees C.NoneInterestingly, the catalyst is involved in both the conjugate addition and the transesterification to form the spirocyclic oxindole product; in the absence of1a, the open-chained Michael adduct did not cyclize to form a gamma-lactone. Absolute configuration determined by X-ray crystallography. Wang and co-workers have used the ProPhenol ligand to facilitate the asymmetric phospha-Michael reaction with a wide range of substrates (Scheme31). NoneInitial work outlined the use of the standard ProPhenol ligand1ato facilitate the addition of diethylphosphite to a variety of enones. NoneThis reactivity was extended to included the addition of less reactive dialkyl phosphine oxides to alpha,beta-unsaturatedN-acylpyrroles and ketones. Me2Zn was used in place of Et2Zn. Reaction run at 40 degrees C.Absolute configuration determined by X-ray crystallography. This reaction inspired the design of a new ProPhenol ligand,1h, containing four 2-thienyl groups in place of the typical phenyl rings (see Scheme23). The smaller heteroaromatic groups are postulated to create a larger chiral pocket and serve as an internal Lewis base, which occupies the open coordination sites of each metal, thereby increasing the ee and enhancing the scope to beta,beta-disubstituted acceptors, thus generating a tetrasubstituted stereocenter. Chiral propargylic alcohols serve as both robust and versatile synthetic intermediates, providing a wealth of potential reactivity with a high degree of orthogonality. Furthermore, propargylic alcohols are present in numerous natural products and therapeutic agents. NoneThe success of the Zn-ProPhenol catalyst with stabilized nucleophiles prompted the examination of this system to facilitate the addition of zinc acetylides to aldehydes (Scheme32). Initial results revealed that, in contrast to previous ProPhenol-catalyzed methodologies, asymmetric alkynylation required 2-3 equiv of dialkynylzinc for efficient catalyst turnover and enantioinduction. NoneNonetheless, good yield and enantioselectivity was obtained in the addition of aryl, alkyl, and silyl acetylenes to aryl and alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehydes with 10 mol % of (S,S)-1a(Scheme33). NoneExtension to the addition of diynes to aldehydes required the addition of 20 mol % triphenylphosphine oxide (TPPO) for higher enantioselectivity as illustrated by the formation of27and28. (44) The efficiency of the catalytic diyne addition to form28, an intermediate for the synthesis of the antitumor agent strongylodial, contrasts with the use of an ephedrine mediated reaction, which required 4 equiv of the "catalyst" to give the adduct in 68% yield and 80% ee compared with the ProPhenol method, which utilized only 20 mol % catalyst to give the desired adduct in 90% yield and 87% ee. NoneCombining the use of TPPO with higher reaction concentrations enabled use of just 1.2 equiv of alkyne more generally, while maintaining good enantioselectivity and yield. For example, these conditions allowed use of an equimolar amount of a precious alkyne with fumaraldehyde dimethyl acetal to provide the desired product30, an intermediate in the total synthesis of aspergillide B, in 82% yield and 19:1 dr.NoneThe alkynol29served as a substrate in a second ProPhenol catalyzed alkynylation leading ultimately to the bioactive natural product spirolaxine methyl ether. NoneThe asymmetric addition of methyl propiolate using nearly stoichiometric amounts of aldehyde and alkyne typically led to exemplary results, as seen in the yield and ee of25and26. This strategy was recently applied to the total synthesis of asteriscunolide D to convert methyl propiolate into the chiral butenolide31(Scheme34). NoneEnolizable aldehydes, most notably acetaldehyde, are particularly challenging substrates for enantioselective alkyne addition due to self-aldol side reactions. The prevalence of chiral 1-methyl propargylic alcohols (i.e.,32) in natural products prompted attempts to form these products using the Zn-ProPhenol catalyst. NoneMinimizing the concentration of acetaldehyde by its slow addition over 30 min provided high yield and enantioselectivity with a variety of alkynes (Scheme35). This methodology was applied to the synthesis of minquartynoic acid,Nonetetrahydropyrenophorol, and the proposed structure of trocheliophorolide B. NoneReaction performed at -20 degrees C.Reaction performed at 0 degrees C.Marek and co-workers have recently reported an elegant one pot application of the Zn-ProPhenol asymmetric alkynylation in tandem with a Brook-type rearrangement and ene-allene cyclization (Scheme36) ultimately to provide a 1,3-diol33via oxysilanes34. NoneOverall, this sequence forms three new bonds and two new stereocenters in a highly stereoselective manner. The asymmetric desymmetrization ofmeso-diols provides rapid access to a number of versatile chiral building blocks. NoneThe Zn-ProPhenol catalyst has been successfully used to differentiate the two enantiotopic groups of 2-alkyl- and 2-aryl-1,3-propanediols to form the corresponding monobenzoates in high yield and enantioselectivity (Scheme37). NoneThe bulky 4-biphenyl ProPhenol ligand1fgave significantly higher enantioselectivity than the standard ligand1a, with products such as35often being formed in greater than 90% ee. This transformation was found to be both practical and scalable as the chiral benzoate36was prepared on a 18 g scale and used in the total synthesis of (-)-18-epi-peloruside A. NoneReaction performed on a 96.5 mmol scale. Reaction performed with 5 mol % (S,S)-1fat -15 degrees C.In related research, Ding and co-workers used a Mg-ProPhenol catalyst to facilitate the enantioselective ring opening ofmeso-epoxides with anilines (Scheme38). NoneThis reaction was used to prepare a variety of 1,2-amino alcohols in high yield and enantioselectivity, once again highlighting the versatile nature of the ProPhenol ligand. Since the initial report of the ProPhenol ligand in 2000, a wealth of catalytic enantioselective transformations have been developed with dinuclear metal complexes derived from this semi-aza crown motif. The use of ProPhenol ligands in the direct aldol, Mannich, and Henry reactions has provided an atom economic alternative to the use of chiral auxiliaries and the preformation of enolates or silyl enol ethers and a complement to organocatalytic methods. Furthermore, asymmetric conjugate additions to nitro alkenes and alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl compounds enable the mild and selective preparation of tertiary carbon stereocenters. The Zn-ProPhenol-catalyzed alkynylation of aldehydes provides access to chiral propargylic alcohols with immense synthetic utility. Consequently, this transformation has been used in the synthesis of more than a dozen complex natural products. Lastly, the desymmetrization ofmeso-1,3-diols provides an efficient method for the large scale preparation of chiral 1,3-oxygenated building blocks, a motif ubiquitous in polyketide natural products. The continued pursuit of complex target structures and new synthetic methodology is likely to result in many more applications for this privileged ligand scaffold.
