In phase I and II trials, sunitinib has also shown antitumor activity in patients with other advanced solid tumours, including BC, NSCLC, neuroendocrine tumour, sarcoma, thyroid cancer and melanoma (RosenNone, 2003;FaivreNone, 2006;BursteinNone, 2008;SocinskiNone, 2008). Gemcitabine is used (alone or in combination with other chemotherapies, such as cisplatin or carboplatin) across a broad spectrum of solid tumours, including locally advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, metastatic BC, advanced NSCLC, ovarian cancer, bladder cancer, and others (Gemzar (gemcitabine HCl) prescribing information (2010);Gemzar (gemcitabine HCI) product monograph (2006)). Targeting PDGF and VEGF signalling pathways with sunitinib plus gemcitabine may enhance antitumor activity compared with either agent alone. Extensive preclinical evidence suggests additive and/or synergistic effects in solid tumour models when a variety of chemotherapies, including gemcitabine, are combined with targeted agents, including sunitinib (YeeNone, 2004;CarterNone, 2007;ChristensenNone, 2008), as demonstrated in a recently reported phase I trial of sunitinib on a continuous daily dosing schedule plus gemcitabine in patients with advanced solid tumours (BrellNone, 2012). The phase I dose-finding study reported here was also conducted to investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and antitumor activity of sunitinib (on an intermittent dosing schedule) in combination with gemcitabine in patients with advanced solid tumours for whom curative therapy was not available. Planned dose-escalation schemes for sunitinib (both schedules) and gemcitabine are shown inTable 1. Schedule 4/2 was not evaluated past the initial combination dose level (sunitinib 37.5 mg and gemcitabine 750 mg m-2) as it proved to be an awkward scheduling regimen in practice because of missed or delayed doses of gemcitabine (see Determination of MTD). If ANC was between 500 and 1000 cells per mm3with no signs and symptoms of infection, gemcitabine was given as scheduled and growth factor administration (Neulasta; pegfilgrastim) occurred 1 day later. The primary objective was to assess the MTD and overall safety and tolerability of sunitinib administered in combination with gemcitabine in patients with advanced solid tumours. Blood samples for determination of full PK profiles for sunitinib and SU12662 were collected for patients receiving Schedule 4/2 on cycle 1, day 15 (sunitinib alone) and day 22 (sunitinib and gemcitabine), and for patients receiving Schedule 2/1 on cycle 1, day 8 (sunitinib and gemcitabine) and day 15 (sunitinib alone) at pre-dose and up to 25 h post-dose. For gemcitabine and dFdU PK profiles, blood samples were drawn pre-dose and up to 9 h after the start of infusion on cycle 1, days 1 and 22 (with sunitinib on Schedule 4/2) or on cycle 1, days 1 and 8 (with sunitinib on Schedule 2/1). Fifty per cent or more of patients were on treatment for more than 6 months at all dose levels, except the lowest (sunitinib 37.5 mg plus 750 mg m-2). One of eight patients on Schedule 4/2 experienced a DLT (grade 3 neutropenia) at the initial dose level of sunitinib 37.5 mg+gemcitabine 750 mg m-2, warranting further dose escalation. However, several patients treated on this regimen either missed or had delayed doses of gemcitabine because of slow recovery from neutropenia, and it was decided not to pursue this regimen further. Two of eleven patients (18%) on Schedule 2/1, pre-amendment, had DLTs at the dose level of sunitinib 37.5 mg+gemcitabine 750 mg m-2(appendicitis/abscess and QTc prolongation). Dose escalation proceeded to the maximum planned dose level of sunitinib 50 mg and gemcitabine 1,250 mg m-2; further dose escalation was not tested as these are the highest approved doses for each agent individually. Seven patients died on study, six related to disease progression and one to liver failure (hepatotoxicity has been observed with sunitinib;SUTENT (sunitinib malate) prescribing information (2012)). On Schedule 2/1, pre-amendment, treatment-related non-haematological grade ?3 AEs for sunitinib 37.5 mg plus gemcitabine 750 mg m-2were nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, abscess, appendicitis, electrocardiogram QT-prolongation, hyperamylasemia (eachn=1), and hyperlipasemia (n=2). Plasma PK parameters and geometric mean ratios for subjects with paired observations for sunitinib, SU12662, total drug, gemcitabine and dFdU, as a single agent or in combination, are summarised for all dose levels combined inTable 4(plasma concentration time curves for patients on Schedule 2/1 are shown inSupplementary Figure 1). The slightly lower sunitinib and total drug Cmaxand AUC24values for sunitinib plus gemcitabine (i.e., on day 8) as compared with sunitinib alone (i.e., on day 15) is likely because of sunitinib and its metabolite not achieving complete steady-state levels by day 8 (sunitinib half-life is 40-86 h) (FaivreNone, 2006). Among 25 patients on Schedule 2/1, post amendment, PRs were observed in 7 patients across the full range of doses: two with pancreatic carcinoma and five with RCC. s.d. Our results indicate that oral sunitinib given on Schedule 2/1 combined with IV gemcitabine given on days 1 and 8, with each agent at the maximum individual approved dose, has a favourable safety profile. Schedule 4/2 was not pursued beyond the initial dose level of sunitinib 37.5 mg plus gemcitabine 750 mg m-2for practical reasons (i.e., because of missed or delayed doses of gemcitabine because of slow recovery from neutropenia). This safety profile is similar to that reported in phase I trials of sunitinib in combination with other chemotherapy regimens, including docetaxel, capecitabine, pemetrexed, carboplatin plus paclitaxel, and gemcitabine (with and without cisplatin), in which most AEs were mild to moderate in studies including patients with all solid tumours or those restricted to NSCLC (SweeneyNone, 2007;ChowNone, 2008;HeathNone, 2008;TraynorNone, 2008;ReckNone, 2010;BrellNone, 2012;OkamotoNone, 2012). In the earlier phase I trial with gemcitabine, growth factor support was excluded and the recommended phase II dose was gemcitabine 675 mg m-2on days 1 and 8 and sunitinib 25 mg on continuous daily dosing (BrellNone, 2012). However, the most common challenge in drug tolerability, as expected with this combination and also reported previously (ReckNone, 2010), was haematological toxicity, particularly with regard to day 8 administration of gemcitabine, but was manageable with growth factor support. For example, the incidences of the most common grade 3 or 4 haematological toxicities associated with this combination (Schedule 2/1, post-amendment) were substantially higher than that with sunitinib monotherapy (in treatment-naive patients with metastatic RCC;SUTENT (sunitinib malate) prescribing information (2012)): neutropenia (52%vs17%, respectively), leucopenia (32%vs8%), lymphopenia (28%vs18%) and thrombocytopenia (28%vs9%). In contrast, increases in grade 3 or higher non-haematological toxicity were reported for the combination of sunitinib plus erlotinib in a phase III trial of NSCLC (ScagliottiNone, 2012). There appeared to be no clinically relevant changes in the PK of sunitinib and total drug when sunitinib was administered with gemcitabine, which is consistent with the literature in which gemcitabine has not been reported to be a substrate or inhibitor/inductor of CYP3A4, the main CYP450 isoenzyme involved in the metabolism of sunitinib and its metabolite. In addition, co-administration of sunitinib with gemcitabine did not appear to affect the PK of gemcitabine. This treatment regimen has promising antitumor activity, surpassing that shown in the earlier gemcitabine phase I combination trial, in which 4 of 33 patients had a PR (BrellNone, 2012). Sarcomatoid differentiation, found across all RCC histological subtypes (de Peralta-VenturinaNone, 2001), is thought to represent transformation of RCC to a higher grade (ChevilleNone, 2004;GolshayanNone, 2009), and is associated with a relatively poor prognosis and median overall survival of only ?3-10 months with non-targeted agents (e.g., immunotherapy;de Peralta-VenturinaNone, 2001;EscudierNone, 2002;MianNone, 2002;KwakNone, 2007). In our study, all of the RCC patients who were poor risk and/or had high grade or sarcomatoid disease achieved a PR or SD with sunitinib plus gemcitabine. Although patient numbers are small, our results compare favourably with a recent retrospective analysis of patients with RCC and sarcomatoid differentiation treated with VEGF- or VEGFR-targeted therapy (GolshayanNone, 2009). In that study, 6/21 patients (29%) treated with sunitinib achieved a PR and a further nine patients treated with sunitinib (43%) had s.d. Our results also suggest that sunitinib combined with gemcitabine may be a more active regimen than gemcitabine-based chemotherapy, which has also shown limited activity in sarcomatoid RCC (StadlerNone, 2003;NanusNone, 2004). A phase II trial investigating sunitinib plus gemcitabine in sarcomatoid and/or poor-risk patients with RCC (NCT00556049) is underway, and a randomized phase II study of sunitinib with/without gemcitabine in advanced RCC with sarcomatoid features (ECOG-E1808; NCT01164228) has been initiated. Although targeted therapies have yet to deliver significant advances in pancreatic cancer treatment (O'Reilly 2009), there are indications that combining EGFR-directed and/or antiangiogenic agents with gemcitabine may be beneficial (MooreNone, 2007;Van CutsemNone, 2009). In conclusion, patients with advanced solid malignancies for whom curative therapy was not available tolerated sunitinib and gemcitabine at the maximum approved doses of each agent on Schedule 2/1 with growth factor support.
